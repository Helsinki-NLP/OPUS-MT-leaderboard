Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness and now she makes art on the subject - "Man should have a right to his own body"
Dozens of patient records hang from the roof of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history so that the violence in the process would become visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the sex correction process.
It is often a years-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process begins with a referral to diagnosis studies of "gender identity disorder", which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered over the internet and was well advanced in his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process in order to also legally correct the gender.
The Translaki, or Act on Strengthening the Gender of Transsec Sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to forced sterilization in order to bring the right gender to a population register centre and passport, for example.
Currently, every person who corrects their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of reproductive incapacity.
It is up to a person to have the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Translain reform has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary decision obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change in the law under the leadership of then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
Elections came and the Finns Party rose to the government.
Now the bill is stuck again.
It is a domestic policy dispute that is not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about the amendment of the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International's Finnish branch.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the drugs used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the psychologist of the Tampere University Hospital's transpolice.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a story based on these that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of reality being studied appears exposed to vacillation.
The subject's perception of self appears to be fragmented in a borderline way and the unstable traits associated with personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting hall of the transponder.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was born on that television, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who's defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but you need a diagnosis to remove your breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel you are anything other than the amount of gender you have defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
The sex correction process is harder for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and right to their own sex experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment, citing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who seek the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On the basis of these, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed since childhood and teens.
Why the wide chin didn't seem to fit your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer feels he is already seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when people close to you misgender.
"They should know and they know who I am but they won't or won't be able to internalize it," he continues.
Not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, one cannot get official confirmation of one's gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for recognising the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in terms of legal gender.
The adult applicant makes a written application for a new personal identity code, telling them that he or she feels of another gender.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry issues the applicant with a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also crystallized by Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

NGO issues travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which promotes African American civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to state discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
"NAACP's travel bulletin for Missouri will come into effect on August 28, 2017, calling on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state that has recently had numerous questionable racial events," the organization said in a statement.
The law, which recently came into force in Missouri, makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to court, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionately directed at minorities. According to NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped by skin color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri Chairman Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time before."
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization's first warning about the U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee as examples.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and he was arrested by Missouri police, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be on guard and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare for things like involving money to pay bail or telling relatives they're going to travel through the state."
The FBI said 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth highest in the U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
ACLU recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws that oblige police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually published by the State Department and apply to other states, but have recently been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Lintilä asks Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (Centre) has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
The minister said it was in conflict with the state's will.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company said the decision was in line with last year's decision-in-principle on ownership control.
Sanctions immediately hardened speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on their way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in Hamburg in connection with the G20 summit in the industrialized countries, seemed to get along perfectly.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted to bitterly in Russia.
The most stunning response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a "full-scale trade war."
Even if Russian reactions only offset as escalations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passing of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
The law was passed with considerable consensus by Congress, but the president was reportedly much more difficult to pass the law.
Trump criticized the law he recently signed as "significantly flawed."
President Trump's sprainedness must have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting one's own powers must have been repugnant as well.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into both Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and Trump's campaign's links with Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As White House staff have changed frequently and various scandalous twists have been revealed to almost update, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being made in the United States under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is also tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the member states are quite different.
For a member state that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US Sanctions Act are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas lng, which is important to the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and accurate.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now targets Statue of Liberty
Addressing the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know that as well as anyone else: Iraqis, along with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's main ideologists, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a verbatim concerning the president's proposal to reduce legal immigration considerably.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the meaning of the statue, and especially on the addition of a poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 — 17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller thus rayed Acosta: "I don't want to go into more detail about it now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just a matter of history, as he himself said.
Essential are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of their kind in which the state not only calls immigrants but the "poor poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses year to breast free, / The wretched refuse of your doing shore."
The poem is now more relevant than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, and he made it clear that the "poor poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death to attach the poem to the statue's pedestal, well knowing that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the connections between French and American republicanism with a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
The inclusion of the poem in the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh — a mouthpiece who can now be considered some sort of sign of Trump — claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present anyone with an invitation, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives, taking the United States' torch into a world covered with darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want under any circumstances.
Their torches do not lead the way but incite the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the UK Athletics Federation's executive director, says 16 Scots members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant reinforcement".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, something special is happening in Scotland that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes it is related to the activities of the Federation,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And the regular street walker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something absolutely amazing, which is why."
Many Scottish athletes in London are seriously competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly stunning," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proudly of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in a 400-metre fence run, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner, has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London for 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and he is also worth keeping an eye on: he has an excellent season behind him, which includes wins in the UK World Cup Qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scotsman on the national team besides him.
The captain of the national team says he is "hugely proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals and medals.
"It's a great honour to become a captain anyway, but it's even more special because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize positions.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be insanely stunning."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic politics, all the way to his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led stupid and quiet like sheep to slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
That's how we get to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also dismissive online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best reviews of his operations among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hothead.
He has led the state firmly and has adhered strictly to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users who come to the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of moderated comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and factual.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked the question of hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments from the Washington Post.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered an organized group and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack," and someone else might call them "promoting things that were considered important.
In Facebook's era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But it is really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment to the United States Constitution in blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation went to talk to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about Twitter and Facebook's use.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington, low-cost postage payments had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
Nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers barking at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, the U.S.-UK cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of conversation are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a place, and additional online notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individual from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died of a parasite called trichomonosis.
It is caused by an protozoa known as Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially the pigeon.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be observed in finch birds.
In 2009, it was really good.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the green finch stock in Finland, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master at the Central Museum of Natural History (Creation) at the University of Helsinki.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in eastern Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament on the Archerfield Links field last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and serves as the tournament's ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is the game's avid ambassador, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field."
Eales, an Englishman, is defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player in Southport says.
"I couldn't defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil, and he went on tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing in the home area is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I am happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking the car costs five pounds if the car has only a driver, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.

Säkylä investigated the potential indoor air problems of the barracks
No indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's message company, at least for the time being, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies are still ongoing.
The surveys began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had weakened the barracks due to poor indoor air.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and that others who served in that unit have not had health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter in depth.
It is not known at the moment that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that due to the July arrival round, goods must have been transferred to the barracks, which may have allowed the dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of it, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use stove in cooking.
Even a boiler he rarely uses.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he makes dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato — locally "nota" — directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato that was burned to the carrh is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture, sitting on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also handles his daily chores, such as washing in cloudy water retrieved from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is delivered by a bucket in a catless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after 5 p.m.," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its hatred into the Jakarta government, which keeps the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, the eastern part of the island belonging to Papua New Guinea.
The enarotal is remote and bleak, and the journey there begins with a flight of one and a half hours from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour roadway to the stomach with a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated roofs of which have been stained into yellow browns by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribesmen of Papua worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have occurred.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. He means his colorful, hand-woven wraphead skirt, dark skirt, and brightly colored blouse.
"Before we had only leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is a highland area about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine generated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
However, for the Papuans, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of an Indonesian strong army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say that more than 500,000 beans have been killed, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s took on the proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archdiocese report We Will Lose Everything of 2016 contains stories of previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture — rapes and electric shocks are particularly popular means — and relentless attacks toward peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move to the region in hopes of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
Locals find it difficult to compete.
"Changers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Yokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Pania experienced some kind of trough just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports by victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About 1,000 parrots —young men and women and children — gathered at the football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for ceremonies with them, and they began performing the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, where they danced in the ring and imitated bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the mood got hot, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of Kego Koto, sensed the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly colored painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"A number of shots were fired in Väentungos."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME magazine sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"That's when it's about life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Yokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to withdraw his speeches.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed for it," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start surveys in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the Paniai victims are in a dark disbelief about the claims.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this already."
He says he still lives in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Pania people are afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had assaulted him after he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Paniai area of Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the manager refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospitalization was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on a nearby river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers demonstrated at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, locals say that the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one of the villagers.
"We are terrified. We fear revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the police officers who fired the shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of parrots through occasional attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for locals,
As well as bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Few parrots have enough capital and expertise to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is overlooked in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, despite being granted a rare filming permit. The official reason was their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, and has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting on the troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua face new risks: refusing a visa and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numerous and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When a Dutch official delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, a source who remained anonymous at the meeting says.
Indonesia has a 2019 presidential election, but the parrots say they are no longer likely to vote for Yokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the Paniais: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, virtually without health care services and educational opportunities.
Gobai says that the Paniais, like the other parrots, consider the votes they cast to Yokowi to be a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again symbolically demonstrated resistance: they buried one of the victims in the country across the police station and military office.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora barks at Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora is the reason for the flopping up the rematch completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's terrible.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match.
However, the cancellation no longer annoys Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up to severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I needed to be operated on, Chisora says.
The British say they are currently in about 45% condition.
From all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in the aim of Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with dispersal sounds.
Fire takes over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames took over one of the tallest residential buildings in the world in Dubai on Friday, with hundreds of residents forced to flee the 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and there was no idea the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue officials said the fire was extinguished at 4 a.m. local time and left to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch Building Board commissioned a study that found that the plates used for facade cladding and insulation suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cladding plates at Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a Joensuu parking lot during the night
A moped was stolen from a Joensuu parking lot between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was a Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take banned items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited items to aircraft past the U.S. Department of Road Safety (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said they only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey and was implemented by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules.
19.7% of passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules were Y-generation representatives and less than 15% were part of Generation X.
The most common violation of the rules was by taking food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three percent admitted to consciously taking bladed objects on board, and 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men reported consciously taking banned drugs on board.
The survey involved passengers from across the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken out security checks on smuggling goods and how many had done so consciously.
Not surprisingly, the most travelers are also most likely to take smuggling goods past security — knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the aircraft and how much.
It is no surprise, then, that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books should not be taken on board.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay Obama's decisions to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EPA, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog-causing emissions made during Obama's reign.
Pruitt said the change showed that the agency he runs takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention a word of the action brought against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start complying with the 2015 ground ozone standard as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of decisions by one year so that his agency would have more time to familiarise itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed to the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., issued a decision that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the execution of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, obliging companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his turnaround in terms of ozone regulations only strengthens EPA cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to sue it, where an agreement on timetables can be reached," Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise "his powers to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, a New York state public prosecutor who sued the EPA this week, said the group was planning to continue to exert pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people, and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups of their own interests."
Supercar manufacturer becoming SUV - "occurs in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of East Savo measles of the same type of virus
The measles infection in the beach strait is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Savo, reports THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, is of the same type as the previous cases in East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good, because that means we haven't had any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still occur after the fifth sufferer until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, Soster's doctor responsible for infectious diseases in primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions have been revealed since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-dateness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.
More on this subject: Three new measles infections confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for permissible scream
Pontika soup was not even considered legalized.
In the background, the argument that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is prepared by fermentation, with the moonshine distilling again.
The basis behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
There has been no political will to legislate moonshine soup for everyman's right, says Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the moontika was not considered legalized.
Nor was the matter brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says Outi Mäkelä, Member of Parliament (co.).
He is in a group of government party parliamentary groups that took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distill at home cannot even be granted on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for home making alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavor and flavoring substances and allows the manufacture of a scream, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place so that the raw materials or the flavouring and flavouring ingredients generated during their fermentation are clearly noticeable in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be put on sale.
Screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be heard by Parliament as soon as the fall period begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspicions of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for investigation.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Flattered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Littering of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders has leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for having publicly knocked out the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a letter of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a tense exchange of words took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take refugees on its way to Australia must be "ridiculous", "sad" and "stupid". Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on colonizing refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-raised racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in the Georgian countryside and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and picks through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man coughs.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-slap that aired on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded into the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reshape the 1946 events, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with the murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested over the years — even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the arrangements for the re-raft.
"It is a disgrace to history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-slapping is a startling call to action, and it also reminds Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be tried, and we want things to be finally closed, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all, we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of a victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
No one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives for lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by a Supreme Court decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
The FBI said there was an incident at the time of the election where black tenant farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting her child.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI report said.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-emergence of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but even harder not to look at what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't establish a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen black and twenty white — gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also kept on display so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with Malcom screaming and pushing Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said leave my lands, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then the punch goes.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene throws.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the performance, and they want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene starts over.
Now Rascona's words are sneering.
Nobody laughs.
The re-slapping ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral costume stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice is broken in every other word.
A few tens of meters away, fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience are black and half are white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have been under Brooks' guidance at the victims' graves in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
The murders have changed from a story to a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at artificial blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who play lynchers take off their cloaks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for a dinner together.
The white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when describing the feelings evoked by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch the horrible things that people say and do that look like you — just because they look like you," he says.
"I was made to find that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
"Re-launch is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Plant ripping in stores stirs: This much to remove "extra parts" actually saves
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of cauliflower even in the store before weighing?
And take off the pineapple a big hat part - it weighs a lot, doesn't it?
The answers strongly share opinions: for one it is an indication of extreme nudity, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go home to the trash at home.
This phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, cardboard boxes can be found in the K-Citymarket vegetable department in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people rip off the deciduous parts of cauliflower, for example.
The leaves are exported from the box to biowaste in the store.
According to news released by financial messages, snorting at a vegetable counter puzzles traders.
But how much does removing the extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is the snorting really?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take the leaves or strains off pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros when all the leaves were peeled out of it.
Pineapple: The price of an entire pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when its stock was twisted.
Latva artichoke: The price of 2.60 euros came at 2.40 euros when the short stock was cut off.
Delicacy mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without positions, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
The result: If leaves and stumps go to pluck off, save a few dozen cents at best for one vegetable.
In percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
These purchases would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish League, a buy-out price of €222 million.
The huge €222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was for Manchester United, which cost €105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish league held back the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the league's rules, a buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out their contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home audience at the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA examines details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association UEFA so that the union could determine any disciplinary action that may result from the incident.
Spanish League president Javier Tebas, among others, has suspected that PSG is violating UEFA's financial fair play rules with its spending.
UEFA can punish a club that makes more than 30 million euros in losses over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its financial terms.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts, UEFA was announced.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike, flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing the usual work on an airplane at Lunch-Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly a lightning plane struck from a rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane to Dunn's ground near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive," Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividends
British training group Pearson announced Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it launched a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, and the company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third austerity program to revive business that has weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for this year unchanged. Its net sales increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and were £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, and officials said a NATO soldier was killed and several others wounded.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
Unconfirmed local reports indicate that three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, with 30 people killed in an explosion in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "person-carrying self-made explosive device".
The statement said that all injured were in stable condition and treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where Shia Muslims live mainly.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in a bombing in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militant faction attack since US-led forces overthrowed the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce smog-causing emissions during Obama's reign the day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozonimations" late Wednesday, which the agency said is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement from the agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone specifications for one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, the degree of smog is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 states, mainly Democratic-controlled, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to postpone execution.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate environmental regulations during Barack Obama's time, and Trump says the measures are part of a broader economic growth program.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a figure of ISIS's leading figures had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
The suspicions were that the bomb was scheduled to be taken onto the aircraft on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security check.
Police do not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes decreased, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future in the less than 66.7-pound series, met for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won the former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner at Showtime on Saturday, and since then Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on a comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How you doing, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on seven Saturdays.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that a match between men would be "perfect for sizes".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up the series [63.5 pounds] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He's got to get into the lightweight series [61.2 pounds], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Bicking needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight series Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on the payment channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and perhaps plans to go see the Saturday match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's runaway praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the impact force first and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was wanted to happen more and more strongly.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary 5,300 euros, education what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter early next year.
The tightenings are based on the new MiFID, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the competence assessment of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees for a company called APV Investment Degrees Ltd, whose degree working group is home to experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry actors.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material of the degrees includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Degrees Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly around 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, roughly all investment services providers have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 degree because they are mandatory under the companies' own rules.
Then there are smaller banker shops without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing degrees, Savikko says.
He said there were "a few" such banker movements.
According to Saviko, since 2000, 13,000-14,000 people have completed the APV1 degree and approximately 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 qualifications recommended to investment advisors.
Some banker companies consider completing the degree to be an advantage.
More industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is then that the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly employees are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in assignments earn over 5,900 euros per month and women over 4,500 euros, respectively.
The tenth of those making the most earn earn earn earners earn an average of about 8,100 euros.
A tenth of men who earn the most earn more earn more than 9,000 euros per month or more, one tenth of women who earn the most earn the money earns 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the employee and task level, self-regulation has been trusted so far.
According to Fiva, the inspection it carried out resulted in individual cases where the professionalism and competence of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor's activities.
Investment products can also be sold in principle, even if the professionalism and competence are at a sensitive level.
In principle, the situation in this regard has been wild and free.
More industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II.
It requires that each company be responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing the investment services are sufficiently skilled.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, in turn, is likely to be empowered to determine what needs to be known.
Fiva Market Supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the regulation on requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and investment product sellers.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both the own staff of investment firms and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court says that, according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably be empowered to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and continuing training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has also been done.
The Court specifies that in practice, for example, the company must map out the job descriptions of the personnel at the individual level.
This will certainly come at different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if the knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
The court says that with the change, the rules will tighten and concretize.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter in early 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drawn" a giant aircraft on top of the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States on Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday on a 787 Dreamliner, with Boeing testing the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew over 18 hours and 1 minute for a distance of 15,700 km, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming schoolchildren are not startled by rain or sun roast - Iines Kaikkonen persistently polski with the help of a swimming table village
Iines Kaikkonen was moving at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempuka this week and next.
Although it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers are not a mess, praises Taina Itkonen, the head of swimming schools.
This week's swimming schools will have a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskari are already starting, Itkonen estimated.
Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach in Sludge had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimming school students were training to stay afloat with swimming tables, someone without it.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines Kaikko, 5, first thought about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to smoke towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the sludge beach is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5, continued swimming with the swimming table village.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, swimming teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to the water wars sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learning swimming.
No matter what the weather is, Anna has loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming school students packed on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked on fruit, and basked for a day.
The teaching in the water continued, but there was no hurry at the pier.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
Unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a unifying story"
You see all kinds of things.
Blue product, which manufactures cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks, and a "toilet brush with a border brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film that will premiere in this autumn.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products are torn on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Blue Product, say?
We are the film's partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
He says that special introduction to the products will be available, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
He said the company supports his same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichyt has been introduced, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already perata Suomen Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film to premiere, so there is still a continuation.
The unknown of the partners has not yet revealed their war products, for example Valio, Refiner, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers' age tests announced
The latest results of medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been announced. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency began testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker more accurately than before, and a new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests to date, and the forensics agency has now announced the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
80% of the tested, or 2002 asylum seeker, were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases the forensic agency determined that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
432 cases concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests were only conducted in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Forensics Agency says that the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent. There are no major differences in statistics from previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of 581 tests and announced that there were "references in 442 cases that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it became apparent that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee joints. Then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has had puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the forensic agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, with a risk of about 10%."
Ilonen collapses 30 places in Scotland
The five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 sections on a result strip down in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left for Saturday in split place 11, but was found to share place 41 at the end of the tour.
Ilonen was accompanied by a double bog with three bogs in a difficult weather.
Others had a difficult time too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to share a top spot on one of the under par tours, although he said there was enough work to do on the umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I hung with it and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top spot with his compatriots Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor to change party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience burst into fresh applause.
"Tomorrow, a registered Republican Party member," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a significant announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and Forbes said he was the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night that "the party change of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than a better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and cannot find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Lightning sown damage - Thursday becomes even the summer's toughest thunder day
By the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also be made in southern Finland.
Over the past week, it has thundered especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the toughest thunder day of the summer to date.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, there has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
In Pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue services received a report of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in a sauna space at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find the fireboxes and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
At Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning lit the outbuilding in flames on Harjulantie before midnight.
By the time the rescue services arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue department had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding about fifty square metres in size burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house again in Rääkkylä.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The rescue services visited the scene to check the case, but this time the lightning could not cause a fire - only a few fuses fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunderstormed section of the line.
The lightnings have sown havoc throughout Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively limited this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely closed! estimates Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of summer, it also feels powerful to many.
This could seem like a really tough thunder, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the land lightning flashed 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 land lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning had risen to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something to catch so that this year does not break the "record" two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a birth environment acceptable to thunders.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to move south from the northern parts of the country to Saturday, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
A more unified rain front is expected in the central parts of the country.
According to Tuovinen, it only thunders sparsely.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics director Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia's ban is appropriate and that he is determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken a gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia had been presented in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
"I think his response today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded proposal," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country was going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to restructure its activities."
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia accepted the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete for neutral athlete status in the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF working group, said Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still inadequate, and coaches who have been banned from operating continue to operate freely," he told reporters to the IAAF Council on Friday after his presentation in London.
Production company disappointed with poor success of Tom of Finland film
Tom of Finland did not become the kind of success the authors hoped for, Yle says.
If you honestly say so, I am disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle, CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
There was no lottery win, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in the home country, they would have already had their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player transfer ever made.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, and can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play financial rules in 2011, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary for the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG has no trouble paying Neymar's transfer amount and connecting him to its star guard, as the club is funded by a dynasty rich in Qatar's oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on acquiring players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platinum, a Frenchman elected as UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the first implementation of Roman Abramovich's business model used by Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the Fair Game Economic Rules will last until 2018. During that time, clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to €30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave the UEFA president's duties scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future as well," Andrea Traverso, responsible for fair play financial rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it may amortize the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, later reduced to €20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies related to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that Qatari Tourism Authority's support for PSG was oversized.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's merits at PSG might be funded by fees available from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, PSG and the Organizing Commission have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA is even more closely monitoring companies to circumvent the rules.
Sources informed on Thursday said UEFA had not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of companion products and jerseys.
The Society estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish League, which was clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly breaking the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the operations of the football club, which is owned by the American sports tycoon.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns the football team.
Compliance with the economic rules of fair play becomes very difficult. There are so many interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now we are in a hurry: Finnish World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long-term jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-stitcher Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä will compete in the three-loop qualifier on Saturday.
However, the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in a British major broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but that has not been good enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what," said Jorma Kemppainen, the coaching director.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It's not that important.
As long as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
World Cup Medal for Finland from London calls for a miracle
The World Athletics Championships will begin in London today on Friday and will last for a good week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value race to another, where gaining experience will mature the athlete's performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small World Cup team in Finland, and no veterans either.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the games, even though London medals are not settled until late in the evening due to the time difference.
Of the previous World Championships in Athletics 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spearthrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The skeptics expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the other is told by the recent results of him and the other throwers and by Long Hill's remaining in the qualification at last summer's championships.
Whatever happens in these races, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the games, getting into the final or setting your own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the coming years will be a good success in the international youth championships this summer as well.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as a match between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the deterrence of terrorism or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air in the World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he tried caballerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and it's a good feeling now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite.
I will try it again from now on, says Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship freezes in port in Helsinki
Viking's new express ship FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship was to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was loading on board at 8 o'clock.
The ship was already late in Helsinki.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, Johannes Rebane from Estonia, who is waiting to board in the Port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical failure on the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting to board the ship in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired in the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship was to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.

At Mälki, the transport proceeds along road 13 to Mustola Harbour.
Small Circuit Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story yearns simultaneously for both the 80s glory days of the characters and the 90s grunge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time — 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars in the series moved on to bigger stuff in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memoir we have become stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived for a while.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it was reported, among other things, the backstory of a vegetable can speaking in H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching adulthood, and highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, 90s stalker movies, such as the horror film Hand that swings the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best part is the side paths.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a bearded hair under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the film Singles.
Moments of random madness may bring this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the spirit of The Americans' Cold War, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series' wrestling imagery, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama, in which a Bushish pair of cops fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring Grateful Gregor and idealistic Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici are seen. Their lines have been dubaned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But that's not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police people spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a group of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught imitating clumsy socialist drama — there is a killer hiding behind Reagan mask, for example. Therefore, the series often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long periods are too long, and the humor in the series is neither fast enough nor abundant enough.
In summary, the series might work better as agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and there are always two fat men devouring hamburgers in the lobby.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as a numb.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will be in the ring in Macau on Saturday, facing former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru is facing a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa from Brazil still fought last year in the UFC organization.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting a parent.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru says.
The Kouvola employee was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were made on a quick schedule for the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macau.
Tauru has never faced such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date was made for the struggle.
Waiting a week doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
Fitness can get worse if you practice too much now.
In a few of his previous struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in erecting.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvolalainen describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come on hard in the first round and try to take him to the carpet.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match of Kouvolalainen did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon of Philippines hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when he was standing: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It was really annoying for a really long time.
New motivation
Some free fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more densely.
For example, future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three games last year.
Now we are facing the second struggle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
I have been training and in good shape all along in recent years.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change scenery for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when we had this guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola employee will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice vertical match.
Fighting is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll go take it to the property myself.
Lower exports should not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who had fought in China before.
I hear it's Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been untenable and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, shifting interest rates because of the increasing pressure on families' income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided to keep interest rates at 0.25% by a vote of 6 to 5 votes.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and warned that households' income levels are under increasing pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank says that interest rates will be needed in the next few years to curb inflation boosted by Brexit, and the bank also announced that the loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to withdraw some of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide affordable funding to banks through the programme for £15 million more, or a total of 115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecast of the Commission on Financial Policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income will reduce consumption."
As far as interest rates are concerned, the Bank reiterated the need for "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation, with market expectations "a little more broadly".
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent to $1.31, which weakened by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker than expected growth rates dampened increased expectations of interest rates, with GDP growing by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and scarce wage increases, and the bank says that the situation will deteriorate even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income declines in the next few years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the shock of the EU referendum result, which plunged the pound to a decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably not start to show in prices and the economy until four years later.
Before the central bank's latest decision, interest rates had begun to be demanded more loudly as inflation tightened the pressure on households, three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation would tighten again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess of its 2% target level was due to a "whole" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying even further as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed a "reverse" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the funding of the drug in the English Public Health System (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A pre-interference drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in individuals at high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year, which states that the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, although claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the English NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention", and was described by the National AIDS Organization as "decisive for an important moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to begin taking registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine taken before sexual intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The target group for treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants for the experiment from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general medical care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the English NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"That again one remarkable achievement in the struggle that has been going on for over 30 years to solve one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted at those in need and at risk, it can have a revolutionary effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news."
"Now the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one at risk is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PREP experiment is a welcome event that was protracted in vain for several months due to the government's slow-motion," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a revolutionary effect on our work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted."
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was enthusiastic about real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house like Queen Anna's era. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her gear and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it right away and made an offer the same day."
Since then, the 90 square meter apartment has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where you could only get into the bedroom from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to take advantage of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan from the Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill, Azad. Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space in rooms nearly four metres high and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer that could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on and below."
Erfan was able to place two fully high rooms on top of the space with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor, a copper-crossed window of Retrouvius opens into the elegant lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, space feel and light.
The mirrors at each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the actual one.
A mirror in the kitchen space is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirror-surfaced furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The style is enhanced by the fact that you can hide the kitchen when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what is unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says of a steel reinforced veneer-surfaced MDF door.
"It's balanced, which means it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, another bedroom and an even better layout.
"When selling the apartment, the area determines — or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"In the basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
Joanne's apartment area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond with the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one is attached to the electrical wires that run on the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of good design and extra squares being able to make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's outfit choice hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the occasion smiling.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-friendly outfit that dressed a pregnant princess wonderfully at her last.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation event Sofia represents before giving birth.
His due date is September.
For the dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue was a great dress for the princess.
Sofia has been on a representative trip to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited to talk to photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and pointed to her final pregnancy.
He grows us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Marketplace selling Thai food.
The Bayers did not dare to taste, but walked by.
In the stall, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiar Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Bayers to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the taste, he said.
I got hooked on the cap.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
We slowly got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to move because I heard the spice pastes made by itself smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we lawyers get to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times do we have to shyly ask strangers if there is room next door.
The bank knows its customers.
He is told where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what food each one eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers what kind of man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me thin and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door, and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's hardworking.
He goes to restaurant work in a sponge and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the fulfillment of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without noise or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
A discovery at an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, security officials got their hands on a list that was important for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains information from more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people in total and the document includes not only their personal data but also images of each.
More than 130 of the people listed are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also included.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Ilta-Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have become more accurate.
The Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of terrorist personal information and images while investigating the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person's home country.
The list also includes terrorist specialties.
For example, the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, or German, as the battle name.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to join Syria to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There is no more specific information about the fate of the man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe with ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man sinks under surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue services, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person who was submerged was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the firemaster on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
Rescue services received a report after half past four this afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says it was a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
Those present also guided divers excellently.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, the firemaster on duty says.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around 4:00 a day.
The crash occurred when another car turned behind the warning triangle in front of another car, the firemaster on duty says.
According to the rescue services, there is a speed limit of 80 km per hour in the intersection.
Brothers fight for over $500 million in real estate assets
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, and the dispute is related to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton Football Club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Torah's value area just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna jointly own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Under the agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about one-third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as "the carrying force and central figure of the family."
According to court documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true, and he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to reach a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family buying a property in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first denim store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, and according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said Luke and Mark were "bitter of the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League club and a best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded, and he told me in his text message that he can't really comment on the matter because it's being heard in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying that he still hoped that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be decided in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news tracking so that the boss does not get into trouble so often.
Reporter Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with executives on his first day at work, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he plans to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that everyone who was printed and heard at briefings must pass through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television — and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump got nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled things more equitably," Sam Nunberg, an advisor to the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter would never have been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know — maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more ferocious without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump didn't send.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly because there are competing factions in the White House trying to push for their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view, and that information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can become tremendously enraged by newspaper clippings that criticize him — especially if they report harmful data leaks, and then he is absolutely forced to know where the information came from.
That was the case in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, a website founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them, and he also did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started after reading the story to ask the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona, a football player in the Spanish League, a buy-out price of €222 million.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and he was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The huge €222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was for Manchester United, which cost €105 million last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcome alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
Raija Oranen, a well-known best-selling author of the TV series Rose Time and Pure White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold Grandma so much along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after the 18 winter.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring a rental apartment also left.
To the light and sun, out of the old circles Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external appearance is also 20 pounds lighter.
Weight went down when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were antidepressants.
Alcoholism was once helped by hypnosis, which also worked on fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling the same way for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, has been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, finished her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who has made a great career as a writer, only remembers the clean white sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession period.
I finally decided to be a fresh family company in the clothing industry when I read Alice Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, she has many manuscripts in the works - ideas for hundreds.
The vagrants returned over the ditch to the "millionaire alley"
One of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands is back on hair seines with persistent vagrants who managed to cross the ditch needed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The vagrants park their twenty caravans near a street called the millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat needed by the municipality as a procession, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The vagrants managed to cross the access barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident says that the vagrants came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown rocks at passersby.
"The municipality must be roughed up to work because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The vagrants were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
Another anonymous resident says it is ridiculous that the vagrants returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even laid a horse in a grazing park."
According to a spokesman for Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Enraged people surrounded Portuguese crash plane
Men who have made an emergency landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane may be charged with manslaughter.
At its longest, it can be sentenced to 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A small plane flown by men had to make an emergency landing yesterday on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon due to a technical fault.
At the time of the incident, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran away from the landing plane to the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head," Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach, told the newspaper.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The beachers surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating up after it, Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, told Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash landing.
Finnish star who tragically lost her leg won again World Cup gold: "Without an accident I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finnish time early Wednesday morning in the competition held in the banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
Greater Hamari also won the World Cross gold medal earlier in the Games.
In total, three World Cup titles have already accumulated.
What an incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was treated, with a pretty good heart rate, Greater Hamari, reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
Differences are decreasing, and there are many new skiers involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eagerly counting with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not take the desire to get to the slope.
It comes to mind from time to time what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to ifs.
Those cards are used to play what has been dealt, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Greater Hamari will not.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Greater Hamar's biggest board enthusiasm was already fading.
The job towards the top didn't really start until after the accident.
I was training with friends when I was young, and we were always excited to have X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow in that X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this was going to be a really long life if I stay here and feel bitter and sad.
I decided to pull on the overalls and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair reeler Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at the sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal to the parasports people.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open your eyes to the parasports world as well.
When is it time to launch the annual athlete campaign by double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see about it in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Greater Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he has coveted.
Next year, there will be a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We will go there to get a medal!
Syrian refugee youth majority do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing about a change in the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency chain, investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February and March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24 responded to the study, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think they are returning to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the war that is taking place in Syria and ISIS' presence in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in permanent return, while a quarter felt that the most important thing would be ISIS' departure from the country.
Less than one tenth of the main factors affecting the decision are the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abdication of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter consider Assad's presidency an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS' power weakened over the past year, while one fifth feel its power has strengthened.
Respondents say the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media would pass on information to people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people raised military measures and education reform as their primary means.
A good tenth would think the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia's and Iran's involvement have improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web in order - the database he develops is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example
MariaDB, a Espoo-based company, is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs absolutely nothing to users and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases keep huge data masses in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they will use MariaDB or MySQL's database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there too," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's Chief Technology Officer, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful hands contributes to ensuring that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun acquired MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured Sun with $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise about MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company at this point that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the top twenty developers from Sun and thus made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these backups were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar store, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's CFO.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's key figures.
He reveals that MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million in orders during the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps you change databases, which can be more than a year of work if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL to MariaDB, you can switch to MariaDB in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include some of the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oracle also has a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although research company Gartner says that the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still negligible, though fast-growing, sints.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, as most users pay nothing for these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been exchanged for open ones at the time or the transition would have at least begun.
Big companies don't get new customers because most people choose open source next.
This has led to commercial database license fees jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to do with a smaller number of customers," Widenius ponders.
Because changing a closed database is a hassle, most customer companies have obediently swallowed price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom it is really difficult to move because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is becoming full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of €25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One reason for the EIB's funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in countries such as the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions, thus using tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is saddened by how money is wasted in Finland, for example, on closed healthcare systems when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that you can't invent or do yourself.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most famous open source promoters, along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish developer of Linux.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches a year around the world on this topic.
Italy to step up its attitude towards NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that will rescue refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue operating unless they commit to complying with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, a crew suspected of cooperating with human smugglers that promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement released on social media.
"We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the information we need and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who regained their use of the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few miles off the coast of Libya, as evidenced by a document from the prosecutor, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the region, and the motive is considered to be the enthusiasm for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to oversee the operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced Thursday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who have refused to follow the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders organization.
Minniti, on the other hand, said that with the rescue efforts, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are starting to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that plans are being made to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Season worker suspected of killing cohabiting partner at Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Enontekiö's Kuttanen last December.
Police say a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect would have fled with two dogs to the terrain after his act.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when he was captured.
The charge in the case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be filed in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-haired Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in James Herriot's book My All-haired Friends television series.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were deemed to have incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months for her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of manslaughter in June, and her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the verdict and was allowed to wait for the application to be heard in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers said both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level, and not even mental health problems, had a significant impact on his actions."
The prosecution read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, in which her mother reported that "not a day goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I get through all this, and I'm trying my best to comfort her sisters in this pain we're always going to carry."
Conrad's sister Camdy's Roy told the court that she is "persecuting" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never let go," Camdyn said.
There seems to be a precedent for the incident, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had in his text messages incited his boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Hair yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter not benefit from the incident by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering a British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion paper stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia had even reached a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank the country's bad-to-poor congress, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi announced, BMW offered to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW director said the company believes that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including Munich, BMW's hometown, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizing equipment are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of following large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions to compliance in tests. In regular driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the leaders' actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent Europe's emission requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuelan vote begins fraud investigation, major protests promised
The company said the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures the end of the crisis
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a Representative Council was elected to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be underway at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began local time on Wednesday night to take over the country's parliament building.
The troops are intended to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has clearly reduced the rainfall in spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the lavender's life.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cassocks to the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Journalist's murder embodies growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the once-weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of a recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children at home or involve them in a delivery that underwent a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, there are enough observations and feelings.
The board will feature the names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
Violence is non-stop, and increasingly the attacks are targeted by journalists. According to the Supplier Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image with Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a trademarked panama hat.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutorship was established, especially for handling journalists' cases, but the Journalist Protection Committee says only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists rarely face trial, as well as thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting was of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan, the state's capital, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota only a couple of blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots, presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move quickly and flow freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is slowly a mouse.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, and rival factions want to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and there are decorative two-storey tombs of drug barons in the cemetery that are larger than many houses.
It is "peaceful" in a coastal state when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and director, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival faction waging war against Guzman's sons.
The case may have angered Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the paper came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish a Riodoce with five colleagues, and the magazine's shares were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Journalists' Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Journalist Protection Committee Award.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The editor must accept the task that falls on him — or play the fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoc staff miss Valdez — a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always got a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean businesses in our cases, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were excluded from the cases," Bojorquez says.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that was the case with Javier."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoc security training was held. A few days earlier it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half joking about whether the two policemen were among the 50% that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's number was Riodoce's delivery planning three main things.
Boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information on who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the names of a politician from the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Governors of it have recently been accused of corruption in cases of much publicity.
Villarreal asked a journalist to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which had "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would receive reliable information about the Valdez column about the kidnapping.
"Previously, we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are kept. The newspaper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who promote press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration caused by another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country. In demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to get international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be moved out of government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, crime-permissive authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narkojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the work of police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut-off head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to close down, as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Break.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and you have to be careful all the time.
Sometimes criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who was once to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat on the sidewalk in front of the delivery at midnight on a beer after the magazine's latest issue was completed, and suddenly their phones started to color the message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort, 19 people had died.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists posted news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be re-made the next day.
Sirens howled nearby — yet another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's editorial continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man looks like a middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting the business. "How could I close the paper when our intern asked to get out on the street to do a case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard Place"
Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, had a short party, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
It started a long period of illness, stretching to nearly five weeks.
May went practically completely ill.
First there was the flu and finally there was a pediatric disease like ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't get the most out of my training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, as reflected in the KIHU roll mat test of the Competition and Top Sports Research Centre on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis on roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I stayed on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
The wall came up, Manninen says.
In a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize my body's metabolism.
Now there is a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also a week and a half off from flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen right away in the opening race when Manninen got up on top skiing for the 18th.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, the intention would be to be involved in at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be made to be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully, the name will be on the Olympic team list after that, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummelainen underline who celebrated gold in the 2002 team competition in Salt Lake City.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by camouflage
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to define that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100-pound boulder.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha's research found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had an armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor disguised it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter coloring from the top, which still occurs in many animals.
Experts said it was thus better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring in which the body is darker on the top and lighter than below.
The observation was still a surprise, as Borealope is significantly larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
It suggests that flesh-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to the point that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
Of the current animals, such as deer, zebras and armadillas have similar coloring, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurusk was seriously threatened.
"The preying of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in Nodosaurus scales reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its bowels to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted to the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was as warm at the time as it is in Florida today, and rivers and seas likely extended much further than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has survived and it has also survived in three dimensions in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost like it did in the early Cretaceous period.
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little bit of eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The Cretaceous period was an era of the theropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years earlier than Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, believing that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world with its skins and armor from snout to hip.
Nodosauruses were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two six-foot spikes rose from their stages.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through what is now Western Canada until it was transported to the open sea by a flooded river.
Its armor has survived down to small details in the undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin still remains in armored pitted plates along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more closely you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its skull armor pitted plates still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales of its sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
A day earlier, he had arrived in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police lock tapes and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, whose sign said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another police officer tuning his rifle and shouting, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m. Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter at his father's house and decided they would leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been the subject of the documentary "Whose Streets?", which premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and a crown compatible with it, they had a re-conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell later told me.
"The events of today are... the culmination of events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow up to it.
He must be equipped for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and conditions of the experience of living black. And he must know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, which became a campground for activists as they waited for information on the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the president of an organization of minority nursing students. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director, in the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to simply tell what was happening.
Ferrell was reminded of a doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's happening, or do you want a story you can use?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually whites, had appeared in the local community, who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no voice in common," Folayan recently said in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals, following the events of Brown's shooting in the years that followed.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how local people are portrayed in the movie because I'm portrayed the same way."
Folayan said the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because they wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but a community". However, Ferrell proved to be the most open to the people being described.
That's why the documentary features surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he tells me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and refocuses the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight all the time on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees, "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson long ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway at the demonstration.
His description of the social policy climate of his home corners is short and concise: "Mixed."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has hung a face in the middle of the exhibition space — white, black, and brown faces that can be more closely seen as resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third last day of his tenure.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical statement on the malleability, ambiguity and causal relationships and identity behind interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty, and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including violation of the Spy Act, computer fraud, and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black and white selfie where the uncomfortable Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car, wearing a platinum-light wig that became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a highly popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, which provided DNA information on tobacco butts and gums, for example, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference at the new exhibition.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images comic book together, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump is waging his own war against leakers and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways to strengthen the powerful divisions he actually had to mitigate on Twitter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and under it Manning's great autograph, where the point of surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to "the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist belongs — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there are 30 of them on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in his room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," the picture reads.
"Never keep quiet."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," an artist from Philadelphia says.
"It's so impressive, I still get cold colors."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd feel to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the crowd that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say they have launched a national search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death. Arrest orders have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
A local bulletin released by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as murder, and police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Social Relations at the University, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by a university and Somerville College spokesperson via email states that "we have been in contact with police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every way possible."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Chicago Police Department Information Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he urged suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly specifying our searches," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities would help find suspects.
He said police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as terrible.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board issued the following statement to the residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
Police said the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23.
The staff said the man had "threated to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore's events," a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told the police during interrogation.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay the legal costs of £620, or about €690, and the compensation of £85, or about €95, to the victims.
Scotland Yard spokesman said several hate crimes were not reported.
"We will complete WADA road map operations in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the WADA road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RDADA).
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in these respects," Mutko said Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that is of concern to Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study by Richard McLaren, a Canadian lawyer appointed by WADA.
Mutko said, "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words had echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was on the "right track" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of Finnish-loving innovation: There is "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting SIDS, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
Hidden death means the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert in the safe sleep of a child in the UK health authorities.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them, as it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, the good reading in Finland is the result of a variety of reasons, including a small number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box may be one factor.
But that cannot be said for sure," Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity kits are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The packaging includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends using the packaging only for naps and stopping using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and making sure it doesn't get wet or dirty.
The villain escaped from the Japanese zoo for the second time.
Japanese zoo staff are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo via the main entrance.
It doesn't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55-pound and about one metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the shelter area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The last runaway trip of the villain occurred the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The rooms were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of human resource start-ups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, as well as provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with senior management past the board.
"You can follow your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where do you stay with the companies Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides analytics software for companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained an even deeper view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The program can be used to make quick surveys and votes for specific teams. In addition, it can draw up a map that shows at a glance which departments are the most dissatisfied for employees and which of the leaders have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Errett may have drilled into the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they must follow a workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. There has been turmoil around the transport company since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those talking about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry that, according to Let's Talk Payments, can reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation was hit.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can anonymously report inappropriate behavior via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of inappropriateness, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"The general opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene; consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convertent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily connect with the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address that was able to make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel James Vitrano, who said that complaints from employees were difficult to follow.
Previously, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair wages can be detected and treated more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
Quinlan said companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the context of the Enron scandal.
Only with social media did companies realize that they could no longer prevent the public settlement of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethics control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convertent offer their software as a service, the use of which is charged regularly.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent have private equity investors to support them.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of Rewarding and Well-being at Employees.
Investors get returns when companies succeed, and companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on that basis.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if there is no change fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
And does their opinions matter?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
Errett said Madison Reed is currently conducting staff surveys monthly and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is announced in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff retention in the long term in an industry known for the high turnover of employees.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it loses customers as well.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked female neighbor, reports TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she had noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a string outside her window.
The woman said the cell phone camera was filming in the apartment.
The woman, frightened by the incident, had run into another room to dress.
After the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after recalculated into the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of cryptography has admitted to filming a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video shot on the cell phone had been removed and police had failed to return it as evidence.
During the interrogations, the man has admitted to the act, but denied committing the crime.
The man he described had justified by saying that he loves his neighbor "just crazy".
According to the TT news agency, the man is charged with the incident.
Teachers demand more lax in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed down," said OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to make agreements where the review would not involve any holiday money cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be created once the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that OAJ's terms of employment, for example, have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets were not yet revealed by Luukkainen.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public-educated negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a weakening of the purchasing power of public sector wage earners, while at the same time private sector purchasing power is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, the temporary holiday allowance cut will further eliminate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who do best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
Bruins players' day lengthened as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost 11:00 in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have been left talking to the other side of the new training fields on campus.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shiny with sweat after the first day of training camp toil.
For many of them, this few minutes of chat is a noon break.
After three hours of practice, players studying at the university summer classes return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning they meet at half past seven at Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one, with the aim of reducing the number of players' work, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final final exams are held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started at 15 minutes past seven in the evening, and it was hard to find room in the players' full schedules anyway.
Limiting training sessions to one day means there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Mora's six-way Westwood coaching season that continues to be held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think things will get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outsiders after camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the paint post.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises for video from there. It's not an exaggerated concern.
The video shot from the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which will already be considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has been influencing the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extreme rumors.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will be able to pursue the third term because the constitution, which was limited to two terms of presidency, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly well-liked leader.
In his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to increasingly independent fact inspectors, as well as present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced the issue on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news distributors, and many believe that fake news affected the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election.
The subject has risen to political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content as a matter of urgency.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact-checking will be tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass through the screen of independent auditors. They also want more background information to be able to decide more informed about what to read and share," Sara Su, Facebook's news feed product manager, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook continues to test the Related Articles function and makes other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Origin of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for its Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now this castle, located in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says longingly.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story was illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archive-based book. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the National Library of Britain. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent working for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
A writer attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council of England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not stay in the castle without delay for a little longer than he would have hoped.
He spent the days studying Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles that were moated for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest rangers, gardeners and sometimes artists who also illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing".
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was not transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the days of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, here families even fought for one birch.
I thought we should let it go."
Some of the stories in the book advance from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, which is about a man who joins the English peasant revolt shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant revolt in England began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a story about a priest hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funerals with the stones of a coffin (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family men seem to have been quite a little bit of a rascal, and they were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men in the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court heiress."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a sanatorium that operated in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia had even reached a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged to thank the country's bad-to-poor congress, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko to stop rematch against Anthony Joshua will not happen
Vladimir Klitshko, longtime heavyweight world champion in professional boxing, ends his career.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild match by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I never could have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte said the decision to close was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of various unions at the same time.
Finnish weatherbreakers face conditions: "Take the vibe"
Seivashypkäjä Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken a woman away from the vibe.
There are also unstable conditions at the London World Cup.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer against the pole-cheaper Minna Nikka.
I hate to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little poles moving properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here God knows how many times I have never experienced such a varied wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, standardizing the jump has been really difficult, with such unstable winds in the exercises as well," Nikkanen said at Kaleva Games.
The weather spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been pretty challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold stuck or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken a vibe.
There is no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to his hall jump, he made it to the World Cup.
445 have gone outside.
The circumstances are not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be patient and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualification.
Why don't you move abroad to train?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany in the early part of the season.
I got the jump together and the technology standardized.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally, you've been able to get into the hall to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal way to race?
25 degrees warm.
A little wind is fine as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official rude politicians at Yle: "We have no divisible now or for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
He said there was no divisible.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 in Wednesday's First Morning.
Construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, the proposals of politicians to raise a guarantee pension, lower car tax and support electric bikes are being raised, among other things, Virtanen considers election speeches.
They mainly indicate that elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about the divisive when you take on debt," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owes to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: in 1978 he started as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Head and Budget Manager of the Budget Department.
The last time he retired was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
Virtanen pointed out in an interview with Yle that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a spike from which we will be going to go to the bottom last next year, and Finland is facing a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump said the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, would be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and are supported by the president.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Pictured is Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her wife Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, the Danish court says.
Traditionally, pairs of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral," the court said in a statement Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, the court's communications chief, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural result of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a burial site and understands the decision.
The moment of terror on the road: The car was to come on the freeway
Tommi had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but do not receive money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash occurred at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the Ring III construction site.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family miraculously survived in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two young children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From Ring III's exit to Hämeenlinna Passage, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the evasive movement, the car would have come with Tommi on top.
I braked and turned the car around at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
Parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one who passed by even drove towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
Tommi says no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived, and the family condition was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says he and his cohabiting partner had a small income, and they received family assistance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family does not get the money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family wishes eyewitnesses to observe the car that the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, elderly car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's license plate number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent these days.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen what happened or know something about it will be in contact with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
Title and case corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, another car did not come to Tommi according to the lane of the incoming, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's performance deals with relationships through humor - A self-revealer will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first directing to the What? theatre.
A self-revealer is a musical theatre performance of wrongful relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is addressed through humor.
You don't stay in the mood for bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling a role or is the other one approaching the jacket open?
A plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to people of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-Revealer does not directly tell about his own or the relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own values will be conveyed from the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I also don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Revealer draws a current picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
He says that many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The music arrangement is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to be a theatre expression director at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
There's two years behind and another one ahead.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The growth of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
The guidance has become more and more interesting.
The self-revealer premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
The 45-minute performance will also be seen in the future at least in Jäppinen's study city in Turku.
Self-revealer at Kouvola's What? Theatre on 4 August at 19 and 5 August at 14 and 19.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers from gruesome motocross accident for a year - neckline broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the mound landing circled the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahti movement continued.
He was not only an tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on Earth that the Kemijärvin would not have tried at least once.
He's inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahti completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds in my home for a year, Lahtela says.
The bay was in bad luck.
He also admits that age could have played a role in the crash.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't apply for boundaries with it.
It's just so hard as a sport that it's not worth too much for a 40-year-old like this to do!
After the accident, Lahtela was put in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
It was a long start as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the job immediately after her own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching time, Lahtela often challenged his protégé on the slope and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts didn't seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because I really just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtila to be Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have broken than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speed sports.
I switched motocrosses to Frisbeegolf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not require her coaches to be like her.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture, there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on technological advances in the sex robot industry — just as it had begun to feel like 2017 can't get any stranger.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being snickered, but they are already being sold quite a bit, and we will see even more of them," Sharkey said at the report's release.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm-feeling silicone skin and AI-created features that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
All the more worryingly, robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, to be shy.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the mood or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots, replacing genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resisting, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only start acting strange or offensive when the market gives permission to do so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and there is a president sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Slave) it is not the most worrying imagery of its powerful imagery, for example, images of hanged bodies and eyes excavated. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There are as many attempts to make sex robots like real women (by the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own — nothing referring to independence or breaking the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by ISIS chief
The head of ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb on an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a figure of ISIS's leading figures had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
The suspicions were that the bomb was scheduled to be taken onto the aircraft on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security check.
Police do not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Trump's good side?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
Trump's term has already repeated to the point of boredom that a strong dichotomy of voters has also broken up families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of American newspapers guided how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to puncture our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans in our family.
He recalled that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including the Republican-supporting sibling he has been arguing with for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, but more broadly, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be horrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrible chance that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, who suddenly seem to make sense compared to Trump.
I look back on Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and his tax returns we've seen). Compared to Trump, they seem like very minor violations.
When Trump's term is over, Republicans' next presidential candidate only needs to be lucid, and it immediately seems like a substantial improvement.
While my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park Carousel, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Karusell's horses are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror — are ominous, and the underlying screaming music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's characteristics become disillusions over time: views of tall buildings begin to get bored, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it doesn't count.
The carousel of the central park, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to the point that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their 40s enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
Same thing at the cafe in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put their persona into play in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman at the department store smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired Inter for "There was no management trust"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq's team coach of the team.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching group will continue in its current positions.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously served as an assistant coach in the English Sunderland, among others.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching team in January, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now," Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
He, together with the rest of the coaching team, is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the team has been in turmoil throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been set aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed heavily in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several has been added to the photo, which can be used to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders a young woman looking at the camera seriously.
Long ago, serious, he's communicating.
If the picture is not visible, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a pair of photos of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look," Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added hashtags to English life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating rushes of previous years.
He was already 14 years old in the hospital for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was not finally revealed until 2006.
The healing slowly began.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital due to chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which he said he got after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country's foreign ministry's bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unlicensed camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation into the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone camping in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court might impose a fine.
Neste's stock sinks - sunk already -7.7%
Oil processor Neste's share has sunk by 7.7 per cent at around 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes decreased, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock market has started off on the cold side today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the extensive European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, OMXH, had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after trading for about half an hour and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million were the morning result publisher Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, director of the study, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes do not enter the body in food.
The cells that balance the cells that cause inflammation, which strengthen tolerance, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Experiments found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to start showing up immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of tolerance-promoting cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan there was in the diet of mice, the more such immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
While studying tolerance-enhancing immune cells, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to microbiomes in the intestines of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were observed, which were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, growing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferring small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse nutrition, the number of tolerance-enhancing cells increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half from the previous one.
Cervantes-Barragan says that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "nero" after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "nero" after signing with Nemanja Matic. Midfielder debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not on the Asian tour of the blue shirts until the start of the season. He only did 45 minutes on the field - it must be changed before the season of the Premier League began, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius — he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting lineup for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four preferred players.
"Three out of four — you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball national team lost their fourth match of the World Cup to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level in gaming is high.
Their game was steady in every sector," Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents cramped, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we could swing along, Kangasniemi said.
The most powerful in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three out of four games, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. on Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to meet Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A large jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent challenges related to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin connections.
This is reported by Reuters, a news agency that at the same time confirms the news revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges related to the meeting of Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for its Kremlin connections, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, White House current adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington means a closer pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to help with an investigation into Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his immediate circle cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify on oath.
A large group of jurors are ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury will weigh the evidence the prosecutor has investigated and decide whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor microchiped himself to get home and car with hand swing
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing in his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now providing service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq company technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's attempt also makes locks in houses and cars compatible with a microchip. It costs £300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern grass field for an event presenting American production cost taxpayers $24,000, as evidenced by military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is on board it, a attraction to an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017 that featured American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials became acquainted with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi were on display.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter on site by task-specific order just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern grass field for an "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email the day before the event to his supervisor, who is an assistant commandant for naval airlift.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would start at 3 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the scene until after the grass field was emptied between 6 and 9 in the evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter were delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in a helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's house while it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was the official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed at the time in the Senate and looser state regulation.
Using a Marine One helicopter and an Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the background to the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with centimetres of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours in "non-presidential support missions" that day.
The White House said no other costs were incurred by taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the White House's southern grass field.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter has a compensation level of $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico Base in Virginia to the White House and back lasted a total of an hour.
The White House says the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 survey by RAND, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thereby employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to bring it up."
It is not certain if Trump was in a helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down with the driver of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is cut off due to a technical fault, says Rat traffic centre.

Venezuelan state prosecutor demands right to prevent new representative council from being appointed
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body in the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the Representative Council elected in last Sunday's vote is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a Representative Council was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the decision to block had been requested due to suspicions of electoral fraud.
Ortega has also started election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that held the Representative Council vote said the results had been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the Representative Council, and the elected 545-member Representative Council includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Representative Council may dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution to be Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro claims that the new Representative Council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new Representative Council is scheduled to begin.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in United States
Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison on Thursday for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US claim.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, the AFP news agency reports.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Senah would be deported after the prison sentence was served.
The Russian Foreign Ministry harshly reproached Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement criticised Finland and the United States for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
Prosecutors said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further control internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Justice Department's Criminal Department, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt cybercriminals in others.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali cartel takes lead in Netflix hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will feature a third and fourth season. The third season trailer has been announced, and it introduces the new villains in the series.
In season three, the U.S. DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more bribery and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a comeback as Javier Peña, who recruits American and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola to implement exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will implement an exceptional light art work in honour of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next year on May 16.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - the sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
My art allows me to make the things I feel are important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am well taken from the invitation to be involved in the first international Day of Light and bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the holiday.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-implement my art at UNESCO headquarters," Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will announce this later in the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The International Day of Light aims to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fought in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in Espoo in the parking garage of the shopping centre Iso Omena on Wednesday morning.
The parties said the dispute began when one party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a word of mouth between the drivers.
A driver who drove in a prohibited direction of driving would swung the driver of another car, resulting in his car starting to move, colliding with the batter's car.
He then hit the hood of the car that ran into him.
The man has admitted in a preliminary address that he caused the damage and did the wrong thing.
Written by the question mark from Timo Soini: "After that came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have left the phrases "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood".
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women," the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women were nominated in the provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and presidential election will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections while international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election is the first time that power has been transferred from one peacefully democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Flooding of certain types of tourists threat the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of the locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it the "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the big crowds are rushing through the sights.
Venice is choked by tourists taking quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move around the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You follow the flag-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problem-causing tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit at the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organizing the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice the income it sorely needs and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution is planned to allow cruisers to go further from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if Veneto's administrative area, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited by about 20-30 million tourists each year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad miles-long traffic jams on the motorway
The lane north of the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has had miles of congestion during return traffic from Thursday afternoon's work.
The area is undergoing motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, Savon Sanomat says.
At road work, there is a 50 km/h limit instead of the usual 120 km/h.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed at some places on Thursday afternoon, however, at virtually walking speed.
The road work proceeded on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siil, at the statue of Revelation, or golden deer.
I get along well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released some great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon scenery, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in Norway in her current home country, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March in a 400-metre run by touring during the track round 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre fence run at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Iuel, who is busy using social media, soon after his records, found that fame and publicity have downsides.
Men around the world began sending Iuel pictures of their genitals apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account from outsiders.
I got a lot of "stupid pictures" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to accurately identify what kind of pictures he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without that other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When the Amaliens were 12, the family moved to Namibia first, then Pakistan, because of their father's work.
Then came Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask no questions, but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally interact with the athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
Foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career at stake - now included in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career was still at stake.
The footboard strain injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg wanted to heal by no means.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the boarding would continue or not.
Sponsor deals were down and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull to the slope again.
The extension was easy after that.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was like, damn, it's so much fun again, let's just pull a couple more seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September and October, but after a long fall break, training alone painless has been a big deal.
Only a few have been toured by Kisoja Korpi.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for one race for four years, and then you're feverish for that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today, Korpi is competing in the halfpipe of the Spanish World Cup in Sierra Nevada.
Although individual races don't like him when he's on board, he always lights up from racing in a tough company.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, although some boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
Yes, this is an important race, visibility is big.
But I always think that appreciation depends on the conditions and level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-person team in Finland in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when it was at the point that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings new power to you, Korpi thinks.
I still keep up with the slope somehow, but otherwise I don't, that's how much power the guys have!
Behind the board career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Pekka Korve's son is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I am on a trip all the time, there is no more time to be in the mess.
But I look every day at least at the race results and usually at some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, raving and race coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the edge of time and develop, maybe even in the summer I will drive some departures.
If it is my future profession, then it is not difficult to start when you are already inside the sport.
The race stories also include the Elitloppet race with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months left, let's hope to get the ship full," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's care home project Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esther is the name of a new 41-seat nursing home for older people to be built on Kite.
The building of over 1,700 floor area square metres will probably be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbour Health Road.
A common topic of wonder in Kitee is what customers are enough for the new treatment unit, as now, during the Siun sote, many private nursing homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that Kitee will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee.
The transaction was about business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these conditions.
More on this subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand Scotland plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the directors of McVitie's biscuit manufacturer for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish division of the UK General Trade Union GMB, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products factory has over 500 employees.
Pladis, a company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will "be sure to be the first to be told" if there are any changes to the operations.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to "response concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross' business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihood.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising living costs and continued reductions in production, Eastern Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
Pladis's spokesperson said the factory manager had not received a trade union letter until the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it values continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed several issues.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and offices to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested over £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar after paying £189 million to terminate the contract, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for the transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half as low: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best paid professional athlete, with PSG offering him over £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about the PSG's activities and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking the best players at PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponent and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they seek our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this very thing: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not let an Italian leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona is losing its star player Neymar as a result.

Inderes, on the other hand, raised Ramirent's recommendation to a level of "reduce" when it used to be "sell".
Ramirent's share rose by 6.3 percent.
Competitor Cramo was a 0.7 percent plus.
Trump's calls were invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incense with both the Mexican president and the leader of the Scout organization has proven to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
He said Trump was not lying.
Sanders said many of the Scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had discussed at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face to face," Sanders said.
The speech to the Scouts provoked disapproval
Trump said Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for successfully eradicating illegal immigration.
Trump said Pena Nieto said few people will come across the southern border of Mexico because they know the journey will live on the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that there had been no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump praised his speech at a major meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful," Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Scout organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' calls to Trump.
According to the statement, the organization's director Michael Surbaugh's previous statement, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks out for himself.
Trump's speech at a meeting of the Scout organization was a lot of wonder, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
