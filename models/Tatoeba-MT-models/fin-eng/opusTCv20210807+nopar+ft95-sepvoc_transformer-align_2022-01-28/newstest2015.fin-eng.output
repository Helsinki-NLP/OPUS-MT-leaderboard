The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
The union was unanimously approved by the Kuopio City Council on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the joint last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio's population is about 111,000.
India and Japan prime ministers meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security relations, on her first major foreign visit after the May election victory.
Modi's five-day visit to Japan is intended to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economy in the world.
Plans for extended nuclear cooperation are at the top of the discussion.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership on Monday of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," Putin said.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so they don't get a chance to shoot the people in the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised me that the crowd came from the very beginning of the evening.
There were visitors as expected in two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, meaning pop is not in store, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, a law will come into force in Finland that will restrict the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Board for permission to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present in cleaning and detergents, for example, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration driving, for example.
However, starting materials acquired before the Act enters into force may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes between Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of rapes at two hotels is facing a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing in the Glasgow High Court.
He is charged with rape at Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman while she is "in an unconscious state, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision herself."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, the Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Supreme Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, which was strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City times.
Balotelli was still far from his top tune.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already taken the player as their favorite are looking forward to better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotell in Barcelona for the role of Luis Suarez as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team star was the midfield diamond tip Raheem Sterling, which poked the 3-0 win past the important opening goal Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, not just shining with power.
An Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli is between the opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who flies the grass at a maximum speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, a North Irishman told how Liverpool has systematically developed a North-West Londoner that grew at the foot of Wembley into a player that is more holistic than a winger.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkin as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The newspapers down to the Los Angeles Times have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a century, including by performing a large amount of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations in the pension negotiation case - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, new impetus is being sought for pension negotiations from the social partners' own meetings.
The administrations of the employees' organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will deal with the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to continue.
Labour market organisations have been chafed, among other things, by the dispute over tying the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be born this week.
Pihtipudas.
Woman Volley, a women's volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, tripped over league retriever Vampula's Athletes at Pihtiputa in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned five of the 3-2 wins in a stretched match.
WoVo lost the last round 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all the time.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six were risy in that 190-cent American center Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the sidelines.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Despite his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed WoVo's most fire-powerful combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a pick-up, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at "trade" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet at the sports college for the second time.
Lidl forges wild figures in Finland
The company's net sales of Finnish stores increased by almost 25 per cent to nearly 1.2 billion euros during the accounting year that ended at the end of February.
The company released its earnings data on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that nearly EUR 14 million in taxes were paid to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Principal researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed women's health history over a seven-year period.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses, and socio-economic status also contributed to the chance of survival.
In older women and with cancer more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment as possible.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although treatments as remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients treated far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are poor, regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old housewife living in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen snowmobile parking activities in Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the proposal for a town plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be made publicly available at the service point Osreita.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland ely Centre.
With the change in town plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobiling activities related to tourism in the area.
The park area is to be formed, which includes the area between the present Friendship Park and it and the river.
According to the proposal, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
Refueling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
The snowmobile parking and the formula change have sparked even loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been horrified by both sound and concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no observations have been made above the guideline values.
The renewed equipment is also more low-emission than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, the hotel safari customers should be transported to safari departure points by buses, which would be estimated at 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also wide enough for the snowmobiles, better than the places presented as replacement departures, such as the boat pier on the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is good for its location, even so that operations can expand into the Ounaspaviljong area in the future, for example.
The consolidation of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city's goal is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient high-quality areas for places that are logistically and functionally affordable.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the centre sub-general plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied housing is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the under-35 group, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age.
According to a Financial Times report, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money used by homeowners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people are living in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden industry, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and it uses the least money per household for garden products throughout the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increasing housing rental or reducing garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden advisor, says that "for example, plants grown in mobile growing containers are particularly popular among home renters, as such growing vessels can be included in the change if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming period for the resale of the garden sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, after last year's March and April weather was worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. embassy affairs officer and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by Edward Snowden, former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) analyst, reveal that Turkey was the main spy destination for U.S. and UK intelligence agencies.
Turkish news agencies said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states have spied on each other.
A previous report on the espionage by the German main intelligence agency against Ankara caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actress who appeared in several successful films, has been attached to the female lead role in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Copperinen's film 2 nights into the morning, whose filming will begin this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for his role in The Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly in a glass dome.
The male lead in the 2 Nights to Morning film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorca Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Those who reported the incident provided evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of corruption allegations by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf area, which is known for its damp celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several store owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are under questioning by a judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper throughout the country, wrote about the bias of nightclub owners' angry authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not money anymore, it's survival," one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video spread online in which an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, island officials have been trying to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behavior of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcohol-sniffed pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was shot, was ordered to close for one year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were ordered to pay a fine of €55,000 jointly.
Above all, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular among young British tourists in the popular Magaluf tourist destination, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas War and schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but traces of fighting are still visible.
In the southern town of Ashdod, Pashosh kindergarten, workers removed fragment marks from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks that returning to school after a long time feels "a little strange."
"We've had some tough times when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of communities in the Saad-like border area had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are sceptical about returning after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in force for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of the Gaza air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to begin a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, stating that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
Tens of thousands of people were still protected and, as the fighting continued, school officials postponed the school's start the previous week.
"I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, 13, who lives in shelter at a school in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used measure, house prices have risen most in seven years during Australia's winter months.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments, which measures the prices of housing in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, the total price increase for June, July and August was 4.2 per cent, more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
RP Data results show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent and in Melbourne by 11.7 percent the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of homes to be auctioned, the generally high sales rate and the still constant low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
New Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have drawn record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70,000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and features classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Weeks again said on Monday that it had set a visitor record, while 14,500 interested people had visited the Waiten event this summer.
Such figures are not used to.
People have swept through doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors this year will be approaching 100,000 at Serlachius museums this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will go far through the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday night, a window was broken into the commercial property on Pohjolankatu.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck tank on Syväojankatu.
Between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its outboard engines had been taken from Petäisanniska Marina.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
The inside read the text "OIVA" on the beak side.
A couple of suspects were already caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a trace and a man in his 20s was found hiding in the woods under a tree.
On Monday, police captured another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought murder charges to the Kajaanilaisme, born in 1977.
The prosecutor said the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot a 34-year-old Kayan woman who he suspected was a drug exporter with a shotgun.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to police attention when a police patrol stopped a passenger car with a party burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt wardrobes, a cut shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a judgment on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a family of seven immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19, and the relationship between son and father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, a comedy show based in part on a fictional conversation with his father and developed based on a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and decay in the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move over!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer sheath or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, thus gaining an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than they were at the time.
The smelters are a little brighter today but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, where flames, smoke and soot are sprawling and reminding me of the underworld.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself while washing the dirt from the smelter out of himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food for the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity offered by the parents.
My father never hugged me or said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started getting sick shortly before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a Billie daughter with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop hugging!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started suffering from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a rough diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult...
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
Next up was the Comedy of the Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidas").
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old, an employee of the factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent contest.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living with stardom and I was on TV.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared made up for black people, so Henry ended up being a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and objectionable, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 80s, where both black British culture was made fun of and admired.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and film parts, but after his 2008 series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len — now it seems you're just pedaling in your seat or going sidetracks."
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us in school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears tights and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's subject aroused fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, "Try.
Don't abandon the whole thought until you know what you're talking about.
Dating words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was a success in the end.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it didn't quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems with the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do it 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry in the "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
Learning lines to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Henry says this in a loud voice, of course.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: little humor cubs constantly interrupt our conversation as he changes from one impression to another.
Abstinence from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre at times when I feel like it, but in general it no longer inspires me the same way it used to.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It brings me real joy to sit with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don't think I'll ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really fun.
When you play, you keep telling a story, and I enjoy that task.

Kenya prepares register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government payroll.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary," the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an inspection earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on "ghost workers'" salaries and other financial misconduct per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register in the identification centres over the next few weeks to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, a government statement said.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do so without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector because this will determine how many people actually work in their tasks. In addition, this will clean up payroll lists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result for Seinäjoki's financial year 2015 may remain in deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, annual margin is becoming around 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible means of improving the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale and grants of assets, and the increase in tax and payment revenue, were on the agenda.
The EUR 10 million reduction target for investments is 8.5 million.
There is no relief for the situation in the municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient increase in tax revenue, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in central government shares further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the strategy goal," says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals made to the Executive Board for preparation.
The City Board's proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the Council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through the board processing to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of "juon" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officials among the detainees.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of arranging a large crime scene and following phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister during that time) said police actions were part of the planned action of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not celebrated at every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukkhov, who is a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn a lesson that will be useful to them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry says libeling tweet was unauthorized
A libelous image of a Democratic district attorney was sent from a confirmed Twitter account by Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night in the middle of hearing allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
"I don't accept tweet and I've removed it," the later publication said.
Perry's back-up forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a libelous cartoon of Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding for Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury gathering in Austin this month while Perry was on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as allowed... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lehmberg Bureau did not lead a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio who was assigned to the position by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the investigating judge to reject the allegations and said that the law on which the longest-serving governor in Texas is accused is unclear against the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the State Public Inviolability Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-based monitoring team to file a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly — and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself jogging on the lake with the text "Here Comes, South Carolina!" on Twitter.
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important developers has warned that the southeastern English housing market has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital London apartments have been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, which caused the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and president of high-quality developer Berkeley, said Monday that "since the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of stores have returned to normal since the 2013 spike," adding that this has allowed for a "stable operating environment".
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought hordes of capital.
According to land register data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent the previous year alone, thus well exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about one fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "kartano tax" before the May general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices, which says prices will fall by 3% because the index of homeowners' opinion on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions made in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter year-on-year, real estate agent WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, who increased the income from the properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right product with the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained high."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40% year-on-year, thus reaching £380 million and net sales increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for a year meet current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the pre-tax profit for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for £23.96.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold 100 other stars leaked Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "a brazen violation of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will receive the allegations.
The images, originally released on the 4chan photo release page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars being hacked claims to have dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch the pictures I and my husband took in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right from the start.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
Just an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "j"
They dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, gradually they came off like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from a woman that she was too serious, too arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little prickly.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had been a relationship in the early stages, but had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought even some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from the village of the north, which was even harsher and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed was his aunt. Aunti had inherited a house located in a damp but paradise-like valley, and the name of the valley was conveniently Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden, resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to a receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news when Ailinn's crossed, sun-tanned feet brought to Kevern's mind a song that had been sung by a long-forgotten black performer and often listened to by his father.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not banned —nothing was actually forbidden — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to be left forgotten, as was the word unhola itself.
Public opinion produced what had not been achieved by law and by proclamation: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs, cookbooks and romances of heroes, in terms of music they preferred ballads.
Wildened by the day, Kevern began to key the imaginary piano and sing serenad to Ailinn's big feet in a brazenly comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start with a j out of your mouth and couldn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't it now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz had not actually been banned, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word if.
As the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit performed through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that she could not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion here either.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude — with gratitude, that they were like those spared by the trade of happiness — the principle that each group did natural things for it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribian ancestry are best suited to entertain and exercise, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to handle things.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When IT, WHAT HAPPENED, IF HAPPENED, came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of splashing flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe.
Let everyone act on their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung could ever have been dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-legged people think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage head leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was amusing for Dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of view.
Nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow-black hair bush.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair and poured a receiver and spilled the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was also made only of elder flowers, so he could not use it as a cause of collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what fascinately attracts me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessary cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been like life here as well.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical after the event than their smuggler and dispersal grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first —the kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver —to suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, too, because already the suction itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed his going — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the upstairs window —a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten, who had lost all the fighting spirit — why did he feel that sight was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution measuring General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in the areas of the country where the decline, or even the end, of violence was most likely given the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "so that the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the church towers that extend over hedges, human mildness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it gives rise to.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour stories of overcome adversity, and swear by the virtues of marital and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban cohabiting areas in its relentless grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more ominous fight in homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum set his eyes on the ground.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to plead his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality, and feminism.
This workplace does not maintain prejudice.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, things you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church — and what you call cruelty or evil-souledness, others usually call inherent energy and physical intensity.
To keep saying what happened if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, will destroy the country's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingo pink LED light declared a instruction that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the word sung is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to it, WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
This time, however, we do not pour out our hatred and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe 'mistakes' as the actions our grandparents may have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'."
A person in a position like you should not have to remind us that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are absolutely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it more - we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to hand out accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to make them.
But what does the past exist for if one does not learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, as he went to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose drive was described by passersby as "evil-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning attack; prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have banned the attack on the government and said they were working against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and taken over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him that he had been threatened with death.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoi denied the attack and said the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics". Police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's military took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they were ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no entity has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces in every way seem to match the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to officials from Lesotho's army, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is in charge of the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the Great Coalition.
He thus denies that he has belittled the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to establish data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft, an information technology company, has established a large data center in a New Zealand location whose location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent by Microsoft to media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
Microsoft says the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
Oulu or Kajaani had previously been guessed as the location of the centre in public.
Microsoft will completely close its Oulu office, which will take the job to about 500 people.
Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company will not comment on how many staff the new data center employs.
A trade magazine told Uusimaa on Monday about the establishment of the data center.
Man accused of assaulting girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is charged with driving on a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of running on a girl at a intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused her injuries.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied charges at the Dundee Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure your device can take you deep.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 feet of depth, others up to 50-60 feet of depth.
Check out both regular and waterproof models in our purchase guide and in digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for fork, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light is reduced significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your photos; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Try to get close to the subject being filmed.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the graph must be close to the object to fill the entire image up to the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided that Hong Kong voters should not elect candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing unrest that requires democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business block after activists begin planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists the power to root out any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general nomination for a Hong Kong leader would be too "caotic".
Since 1997, with the UK handing over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee, which is managed from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
In the summer before the decision, some of the largest and most striking protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely led by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in rain in front of Hong Kong's main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the movement's organizers announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and they would generate waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, organizers said that the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has failed and the taking over of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and security measures were tight near the main government buildings on Sunday, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, restlessness is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of people arriving from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood — the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will last," says Regina Ip, the legislator who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concerns that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are henchmen of Western powers fomenting the revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people — more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region's largest demonstrations in favour of democracy.
US prom tradition strikes UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing Britain's first luxury mode of travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable arrival possible at the university.
Stewart also said there was a security aspect to the service.
Service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the brim.
Combining this with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today's students with the most easy and high-quality transportation possible to the university.
According to the company representative, no reservations have yet arrived because the service has only just been established, but added that "students will start placing orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of their expectations and wishes. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's higher education section, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority."
Many people who start their studies this month will be shocked by the level of cost of living, as the financial subsidies available in the form of loans and grants have fallen behind the staggering increase in basic cost of living. Only next can we start to think about where to find thousands to use for such a simple thing as arriving on campus.
Ipswich "pig house" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house on sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig is lying in the living room of the house in the picture.
The one-bedroom house, which costs £1200,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The announcement included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned on his head on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the picture ended up in the announcement by accident and has since been removed," a company representative says.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where the question has been asked whether the pig is included in the house price.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish attacker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea announced that they had signed a four-year contract with French tip Loic Remy's neighboring club QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is 13 million euros.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan with a two-year loan agreement.

Bulgarian prison staff to hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria demonstrated in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
At a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations that were recently amended.
Wage increases are also to be discussed with the interim Attorney General Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting of representatives of the Prison Workers' Association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are currently underway," Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest by the Prison Workers' Association is also expected to involve members of the Department of the Interior Workers' Trade Union.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin was fainting on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his black US match and beat Ukraine with his second-half blood-stabilizing solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to faint at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, but clouded, there was nothing to do.
That noise and white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine pins at a fast pace, globsters, record tracks, and tricks wherever it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow state that it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to an incredibly important place," Sasu said.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others caught the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and life-creator, so it's no wonder his example put the whole team on a flight that was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous ones remembered the outrageous judge game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 Argentine World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball national team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first half.
"In that match, the judge game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled in the backline.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pastas went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's champions as the Polish World Cup gets off the ground today Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is even faster," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to continue from the first half.
Then it could be tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we petrat 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
The sport legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

There are always great memories of the competition, Immonen says.
Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks"
When Merethe Mikkelsen from Norway and his dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog in the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little forward, but its legs just didn't carry it," Mikkelsen wrote in his update.
Mikkelsen said the help was not from the police, the nearby hotel, or passersby.
As the evening went dark, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers came and were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanomat.
Soon a German man with an excursion mattress also came along.
From the mattress, Cita was given a stretcher-like one to which the injured dog was attached.
A German man came a moment after us after we had wondered what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.
PHOTO: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a hiking mattress.
Soini said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had had some happy news from Mikkelsen: - I hear Cita's feeling better!

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than anyone else.
I could never skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. After the operation, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the disease information in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and in a panic-like state.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my entire ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you're suffering from some much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was explained what CMT disease is, I thought I had postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
100 migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior.
Police said the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to reach Greece, and another 800-900 euros to reach Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia with a large population of a couple of million on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop bands Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined the supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scotland's independence will take place on September 18.
In a statement, Mogwai said that voting is an opportunity for Scots that only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, actor Sean Connery, among others, has given his support to independence.
British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, for example, have appealed to Scottish people to stay part of Britain.
In Gallup, the supporters of independence have been defeated.
Difficulties in department stores continued in midsummer - Domestic news - Ilta-Sanomat
The downswing in department store trade also continued in July, says the Grocery Trade Association.

Sales grew most in small shops and large supermarkets.
During the whole early part of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has decreased by more than two per cent.
The sale of daily goods, on the other hand, has increased by almost one per cent.
Joan Rivers' family "hopes the best"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was brought to a hospital in downtown New York City, but her daughter was hopeful today that an 81-year-old comedian will be cured of her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.

Doctors deliberately keep him sedated with medication and monitor his condition closely until his serious condition is stable again at the moment.
The incident has caused a broad reaction in the audience, and Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa, for example, have provided support online.
Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto's third reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has delivered an updated schedule for Industrial Power TVO in Olkiluoto 3.

The project is already years late.
TVO did not provide any estimate of the completion time of reactor three in May.
Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas - value about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-acre beach plot to Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sport and was unanimous in its decision.
No gravel votes were heard at the meeting when the property was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
Bottas' gift plot has farm buildings - seven in total.
The municipality will dismantle them this year, with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the property within two years.
We are honored that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue to happen, the mayor says.
The municipal manager estimates the cash value of the beach plot to be between 40,000 and 60,000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has kept gift plots successful in sports in the municipality with varying success.
Keihäänto World Champion Aki Parviainen and aerobicck World Champion Tuuli Matinsalo got detached plots from the municipality and built the magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalo came to Nastola for work and then changed the life situation after it changed.
Bottas is a native Nastolaan and his situation is different, Syrakki thinks and believes Bottas will stay in his hometown.
Hull hired striker Hernandez club for record amount
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from the Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The deal is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo beat Serie B and entered the Italian main league.
In Uruguay's national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games from exchange on the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal's national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian space test failed - geckos sent on sex trip killed
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia have died, the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Gekos traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
Through the effects on the Gekkos, efforts can be made to anticipate the effects that weightlessness would have on a person as he resides in a state similar to that for longer periods of time, New Statesman illustrated in July.
Roscosmos says the time of death and cause or cause of death of the geckos are determined.
According to Interfax, passengers who became "sex geckos" froze.
The surprise is also indicated by the fact that fruit flies that traveled on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track down the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family was not related in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, according to authorities, but now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man's actions before.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France have travelled to Syria, returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the national basketball team for a follow-up position are at stake when Finland today meets Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be part of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the further seat.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning," Petteri Koponen said.
Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played against them before and we need to get our regular defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday in its defeat for the United States.
We need to rediscover our own strengths.
I can guarantee you that there will be a normal pack of wolves on the field," Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged nude images spread online - some confirmed as genuine
A number of nude images are spread on the Internet, allegedly depicting well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "taste campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant breach of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence (on the Internet) will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
TMZ says actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread from her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what creepy trouble was seen for this.
I sympathize with everyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls images under her own name fake.
Genuine or fake nude images are also on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match well describe the club's confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the fight that ended in 1-2 losses.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the bad defense.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here sometime," Viitala snorted without naming any individual players.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed with Viitala to some extent.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given many young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when the players are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive end, the crowd has changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this place," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS loss, tied to the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the league, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop it now.
We will not really fall out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier is going back to being the author of the TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, told about the serial project today at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to the production company Zentropa, the series' filming should begin in 2016.
Trier is reportedly focusing on the script work of the series from this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also announced in a press release by Trier's long-time partner, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a producer known for his hard sales speeches.
He said that a similar series "has never been seen or ever seen."
"Keep your breath," Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series for television.

The first stores opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket Challenge participant with jaw dislocated
British Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment after she roared while completing the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just yelled, but when I roared, I felt my jaw start to stiffen," he tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to shut up, but I couldn't, my chin was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British, who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to hospital, where the chin was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Perspective on wolf howling (kin): How can you explain the increase in fan numbers?
Today was a great feeling.
This was what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 after Finland had played in the EM final against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted at 20,000 spectators, otherwise an empty hall of noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match?
There are eighty times more Finnish fan troops in Bilbao.
The 1995 European Championships were a search period for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, at the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttälä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttälä to the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
There were reportedly slightly over 100 Finns present at the Athens Games.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can tell the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number is in between, it is an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit how our girls and boys thrive around the world," says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Physical Education Sociology.
Certainly there are Finns in both Spain and the World Volleyball Championships in Poland who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
Sports themselves must have attraction.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, however, the masses cannot be mobilized.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were put on a pedestal.
Volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can ball sports transfer this massive interest to home series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played for an average of hundreds or just over 1,000 spectators.
Itkonen considers the question good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
Another school believes interest will shift.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of two interest.
It's a challenge for social people in the midst of a drug.
Bottas property confirmed - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach home plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be added to the plot.
Nastola has been monitoring Bottas' success since his karting times.
He is perceived as a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition condition in the area, from which the municipality will demolish six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas reached Formula 1 in the Belgian race with his fourth prize baller this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native Nastola resident and lived in Villäkee, his childhood.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever there are free formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come, but hardly for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them in the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York City.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the ball personnel on the field, but amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top university players, also wears one.
He says the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulates his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into the nylon shirt, the information of which is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and then to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
The mokkula, which acts as a central unit, is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told us the exact time for the shirt to start selling, nor has it even hinted at its price.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothes.
Athos, a Californian, has introduced a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 apiece and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs two hundred dollars.
The technology was also written by Red Orbit.
A Smart Way to Save in Textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who soon starts his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which later year students borrow their books for nominal remuneration rather than selling the books forward right away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, plus a heavy sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his last semester book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which holds more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics in this area reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores past spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, you can only get a new book for one third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's book "Calculus" is nearly $290, but the book on the online store of special books Chegg.com is awarded $239.99.
Buy used
Books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, you can get a "Calculus" book used from a Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a last-year student at Brigham Young University, 25 years old, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks should be considered if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the renting company, such as notes, the fees for using the highlight pen and wear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return a book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of regular papers can also be an issue.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case you pay for access to an e-book to its holder, for example Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc. bookstores.
The Chegg store provides an "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because multiple classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and engineering can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worth it, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine in law school, recommends using the book ISBN to determine the price, as it will help you ensure you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price at the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Nearly twice as many people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the last worse situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses, seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of the repetition of fire safety in the home.
At least all home smoke detectors should be verified.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to deploy.
All spaces in the home must also have an unobstructed exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are home alone.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-peak meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australian Blue Mountains
Two teenage hikers were raised to safety after being stuck in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales area.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search patrol of local police officers and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found at about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple and were raised to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital and were stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
The Ukrainian army said the soldiers were given a retreat order.
Ukraine says paratroopers have been fiercely clashing with Russian tanks on the field.
According to an army spokesman, the opposing gunfire has been so accurate that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Sea of Asova, a Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits off southeastern Ukraine yesterday sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard was not sure where the ship was shot.
The separatists said yesterday on social media that they shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov insisted, however, that Ukrainian troops must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that an immediate ceasefire should be reached today in the Minsk negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia will respond to any new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions," Lavrov said.
Heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under them.
Authorities estimated on Sunday that it may take time to ease the flood, even though rain was predicted to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be silent and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" for a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not gain the approval of the majority of the French.
The president deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said, earning a round of applause.
As a boring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave alone the controversial 35-hour work week in France, despite the proposal made earlier this week by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work in partnership with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing at a meeting of socialist MPs who expressed dissenting opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right national front, mocked the socialists' constant differences and said he did not believe the new government of Valls would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war calling, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve the parliament and kept his party's election victory certain in early elections and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held a list tip in the May EU elections.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche on Sundays, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Popal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get even worse.
Pokka cheated Good morning on the recorded part of the programme by Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
The Good Morning Finland programme released a funny video of recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Good Morning Finland's advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite straight.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in his words when he tries to say the word budget session, and his craziness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their poka time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull live broadcasts tomorrow," the Finnish Facebook update said.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the magazine photo agency, finished third in the Potret series in 1972.
The photo shows Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Building Masters' House in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
However, at the beginning of the meeting we had over five minutes to shoot.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir's face shows that Middle Eastern leaders have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was successful with pictures of well-known people or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images today, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash image of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost over five million euros
The legality of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost over five million euros and claimed 30-50 person-years.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his doctoral dissertation on information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the data collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the evidence chain and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be checked on Saturday.
1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "fish and chicken dishes included in the plant diet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the women's trip school in Pirkkala caused a pantry on social media, Yle says on his website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old statement that was forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image, which has spread on social media, has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Purity Service, says to Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Each student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about a vegetarian diet.
The stake justifies the solution for Yle by the fact that young vegetarian experiments may leave nutrition short and the absence of meat or chicken may evoke wonder from students' parents.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion. The information comes from people closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalization of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say that information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not be successful.
Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names in public because negotiations are not taking place in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the comments and Apollo's representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales were $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India's middle classes in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 transaction, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current line-up after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information released, Genting accounted for 28 percent of the company, Apollo for 20 percent, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP for 8 percent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have a combined share of 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise when issuing shares.
The City Board of Tampere is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city government will provide a solid support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a dissertation for the University of Tampere, it is necessary to end the period of the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a growing view around the world that the holding of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be expected to reach Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an issue of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi-delfin strengthens the demands for the dismantling of dolphinarium operations.
Näs' death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how to move the dolphins in Tampere to a demarcated sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara requires.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience even more life than the unstirred concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association Animalia aims to ban the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act that is being prepared.
This group also includes dolphinariums.
To support the demand, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in the demonstration on behalf of the dolphins, which will be held today on 1 September.
The demonstration, which will be held at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki, will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season that will start in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for dolphinarium use or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to end fighting against separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "stateism" of the outgoing region, Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled Eastern Ukraine region would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region, thus forcing the Ukrainian government to practically grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which allows it to be directed towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with State Channel 1 TV, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to retake the separatist-controlled Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as a "Novorossian", "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of splendor before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks were "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians are conducting campaigns for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces are attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to the broader independence that has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel fears of Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the Eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine."
An interim remark by the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime deals with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions differently from that of Crimea, when it practically took over an area with a majority of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict polls, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora, would give local governments in Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historic coastal sites.
The area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia also has mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators — after the new elections — consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions different from Ukraine's core region over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of separatists, perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest call to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically significant coastal area all the way to Crimea.
It has led to the massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Saturday, seeking further action to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed that further sanctions be made to introduce them if the Ukraine crisis flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored divisions and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
Lysenko said the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced with 10 Russian skydivers who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez hit the penalty kick.
Lazio got a penalty after his narrowing goal at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez turned down Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
Milan's former striker icon in Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The number of spectators in the match was reported to be 39,000.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of a nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have been outraged by hackers stealing nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been teeming since a group of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were released on the internet as a result of a major celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude images of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko, who lives in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting."
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as "shameful" and said that the victims "feel disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film awards include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that "it is a brazen violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in his tweet: "The release of images stolen from the cell phone is no different from selling a stolen product in any way."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like at home and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the pictures of the fan drug.
Katowice of Poland was white on Monday: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland's victory at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like playing at home.
Such a big impact the fans had on our game," Finnish Captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth period, Finland made a miracle climb from six points ago.
Cuba already ran 16-10, but after that the Finns got the charm on top.
However, a couple hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an airport, the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball fans have been conquering Europe at a high pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 Finnish fans present at the World Basketball Championships.
As if every basket in Finland had been the winning basket of the match, US star Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
