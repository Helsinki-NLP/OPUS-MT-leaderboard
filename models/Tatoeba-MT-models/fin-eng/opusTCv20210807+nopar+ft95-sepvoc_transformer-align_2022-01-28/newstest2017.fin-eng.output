28-year-old chef found dead in mall in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Franciscoan Frank Galicia, San Francisco's coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined to be a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a line chef in Boston, had been given his dream job as a line chef at the San Francisco-based Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "terrible and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family and will be missed very much," the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank stayed in hostels at the beginning, but that recently "his affairs finally went well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to make us food, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was the brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial action measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) asks the entire Council to support new industrial action since the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "self-excitedly silent" on issues that he said led to the agreement being rejected.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the completely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to mandate a progressive and expanding industrial action programme starting early September.
The controversy has resulted in medical trainees participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA medical trainees, Dr. Johann Malawiana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the contract was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external consortium?
The gesture that ended in crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he did not a lot of heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I went crazy on the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to the better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian general public has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in the ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on a hard truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can have after he was almost deposed in last month's failed coup d'état.
The constant terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved as flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey were again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
Adding a long-standing resentment from the fast-moving EU accession negotiations will be brought forward by Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the flashy seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "external consortium", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel the West has abandoned them and mistreated them, joining forces.
However, the two have great disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a total disaster as NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
The bank's strategists have spent this time using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations to Wimbledon master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the headquarters and stock exchange listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, "The RBS brand will become an employer for our investor brand and employees, because we will now become a bank for brands much more."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move towards a brand bank now, because basically (we've been asking questions) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on customer needs, not on our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Prediction and wins 3,000
Dettori sprays champagne after double win he has a total of 3,000 wins
Competition rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone with his second win of the evening on his home track while competing with the Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing riding.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyari, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, this is not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Prediction out after the victory.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical wit separates him from the rest of the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden with 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of the weekend and big games!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is good for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a branded drone landing from the saddle.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race ride for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A pile of wins in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult time at first when he returned after six months of non-competition, but he showed significant strength of character when challenging the doubters and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move away from the leadership of the Russian presidential regime," but no reason was given for this.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as Head of State in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been received with real suspicion.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give my responsibility for four years for this very complex, even if you could say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service (KGB), as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the director of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and a dispute at the scene.
I regret it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from a series about an FBI agent team are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have given it everything I have for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The start of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden at Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film footage of the apparition at Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry transit point and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "cover fans" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 gauze ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit site.
We all witness the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover for the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first lock in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, that is, inland, side.
This was done by pulling the land bridge of the northern fairway 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3% slope angle.
Demanding because the permitted dimensional deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they were alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station set an alarm at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat go closer to the men and imagined the worst," Vince Jones, the helm man on the Moelfre lifeboat, said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from the buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men who have been caught in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow come off the person who was driving the boat when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now to smartphones recently.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had been somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked using GPS, and that can be "photographed" (by using a phone screenshot) or "asked" after discovery.
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch into the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game being released, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level information.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have not yielded any result because most public health warnings are boring and are cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly mobile people are at a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how three pillars of health are covered: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving spoilers of joy are looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications like Fitbit in the past that could track activity, they did not give cause for movement in the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and the use will subside in due course.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the public shower.
Simone Biles is immune to all of that.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible with permno.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
He was clearly better than the silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States balance boom in the finals of women's rack gymnastics multi-match individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to consecutively win the multi-match championship, and overall the fifth American champion, while strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps all-time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same class as other of his generation's best athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose mix of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test awaited in Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-high expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) for women's rack gymnastics in the multi-match individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination at the starting party of Martha Karoly, the coordinator of the retired national team.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he walked his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes his trademark flip bypass - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a field trip at the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerful force.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will probably continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and permanto in which Biles is the reigning world champion were waiting.
He reached the top with boom points of 15.433 and crossed them by receiving 15.933 permanno.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - mere formality - and tears rose to the eyes of Bales in glitter red, white, and blue when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in split third place but lost bronze to Mustafina in renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his perm performance for a return in emotional turmoil, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bales, this 19-year-old's widespread tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot in serial murder while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case of the past decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a driveway on June 12.
The bulletin reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired the handgun up to eight times and then escaped on another vehicle.
Police say the triple killing did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or $2,900 for another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to investigate whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Seven people have been killed and two wounded in the nine attacks that have occurred in four months, which have been carried out in two predominantly Latin American districts.
"These happen in a residential area in front of a home," Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police bulletin about the shooting, which occurred just half an hour before the triple killing, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shells, bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "The situation gets easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike much of his peers, Edmund is small-headed, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how the signs Edmund invented sign "would you sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a regular sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of causes: genetic, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of Zika infected people.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
I haven't actually asked for a prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
Things are getting easier.
You can believe that things will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their banks and caused a wide flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for Safety and Emergency Response, said they would receive requests for high tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of Ascension County, which is below the river, as flooded rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, was at the highest level ever at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people up from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were close to Gloster on Friday among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that normally the water in Beaver Creek, which is more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says another stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It extended all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the stream so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have injuries, and that he is the only one with swimming skills.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods are "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the rescue of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a member of the city council said 200 homes were flooded.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County president Robby Miller said authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tide.
Covers have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to set," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain still goes on."
'Full of bullets' six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say the six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old is shot in town this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered several gunshot wounds to groin, leg, hand, and stomach, among other things, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the men aged 29 was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a critical 29-year-old, the station reported.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating if either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a cross-fire between several shooters.
Attack-type shell casings, which come from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, police are investigating the tapes on the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in her hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, America.
It has also established itself at the top of the species of black and Latin American women.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the sport, but this is not what the situation looks like in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts generally practice in private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Bales coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring cheaper and available gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Latinos) and we have coached national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration causes thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical trainees organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small additional delays will harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new agreement that includes changes to nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee of Medical Practitioners, said last night in a statement: "Doctoral trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it is accelerating the existing labour crisis, and that it is not treating all doctors equally."
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement remains only eight weeks, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a reluctance from the government side to participate and at times a deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, lift the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he doesn't, the medical trainees are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to replace doctors on strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Working battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a constant positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, educational expenses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - will be a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day medicine can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a £2 per day-paying drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurring seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
NHS Supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack in England each year, and a quarter of these have a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material accumulated in the artery wall, which forms narrowing.
If stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes off, it can pass with the blood and break the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that people be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression-preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people with heart attacks later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When recommending ticagrelor tentatively, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Because data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially as regards the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office last year for corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles is scolding police, election overseers and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "race and religion-related hypersensitivity."
The former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that scaring voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed the possibility of setting up guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests that an indelible ink be placed on the finger of a voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access to Council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the voting scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal action.
The court found Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting, appearing as someone else.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern at voting in the election fraud post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proving identity with a ID
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some communities of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling ballots by mail to stop "voice collection".
The report, which Theresa May looks at, also calls for tougher amendments for those who have registered in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
View options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made mail votes and envelopes where votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English (except in Wales) be used at polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric calls the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court remained as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on the basis of numerous grounds without doubt, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticized ineffective "tick-to-box inspections" at the city council voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets conviction was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a source of parliament, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy with Kate's cyclist double and other celebrity-expressed photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces that are currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his photos surfaced, in which he looks frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, becoming aware of the fervor of social media, the archer admitted that since childhood he has heard that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe for the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge this year: the startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's great, expressive eyes have been said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the same actor Annalynne McCord as tanned skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans that "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Theory Presentation: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user recently expressed happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And indeed, the American football star and Dexter's actress have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth post of women's 4x200 metres freestyle infuriated viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead as a pig."
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring "color," was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Taylor Ruck of Canada, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the 4 x 200 metres message final for women's freestyle as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
Review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how indifferent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the broadcast of CBC, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance being sent.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we regret that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russel, the commentator, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and linked the apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
We took quick action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
"It's too much unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark customer stunned by woman who brazenly adapted underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know where to look when she undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try her underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what she looked like in her pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually adapted four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where she fitted underpants and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after experimenting with underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of featured underwear, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on a fit leg.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to fit in, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone stared when he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like it because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more before finally deciding he didn't like anything he saw, dressed up again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, 33, who lives in the city of Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone takes to their home underwear that someone else has tried but that hasn't been cleaned."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the items from the sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them off and they haven't been washed."
A spokesman for Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
This allows you to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York City, to find out how to deal with robbers waving a gun in close proximity.
Whether you were approached from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, you must be the first to turn around to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire".
Then you grab a gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to the curl, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face and back off, keeping the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to trigger.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point a gun at him.
Does that sound tricky?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does this exactly.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's great champion, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk-born host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each object was licked, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a tester of the endurance of his gut as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from public railway stations rail railings to the toilet seat flush button, did indeed test his immune system.
In the movie, he said, "Since childhood, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth starting with dirt, worms, and muddy water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
By comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer result showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands result is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler on the trail of film, Internal Power, together with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because there's something to eat here.
On the trail of inner strength, a Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance people's intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and that would at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'Let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health, and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell more about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added, "Let's say it now: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him about, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were quite tricky.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A bully family destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The bully family caused £50,000 in damage to their rented house after they were evicted for terrorizing neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall after being complained of numerous times.
After they had been forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company employees found the property to be in poor condition.
A gaping openings had been made on the walls, floorboards had been torn, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of points to consider here, because this property is likely known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family's tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease, received a decision on antisocial behavior.
Many rooms in the house under threat of demolition found old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have previously been transmitted, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing used force to evict a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, time to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Cornwall Housing neighborhood executive director Adam Fitzpatrick said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down to the wild wall of the rental house.
He added, "It's a shame that the resident took no responsibility for his or her own and his or her family's behavior, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave community members who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding
Housing company employees now need to clean up the waste stacks surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a class B drug with the intention of distributing it further.
He claimed that the money was intended for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless after now being left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Graffiti had been stained on many of the walls of the rooms in the house.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the shore
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft swept by really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
It was at this very moment that terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost within touch of sun worshippers on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise that belonged to the jet, even though they did not see at first what was coming from behind the clouds towards them.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it seemed like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
The fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died from them on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low visibility due to adverse conditions, smoke from wildfires, and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was realized in all activities.
This year, Eksote is working to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the deficit that has arisen in the past with a surplus.
The excess portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers sworn in military oath in Immola
70 military officers from the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth Special Border Jaeger Course was held on the garrison sports field.
70 conscripts were sworn in by a military oath.
Special border Jaegers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become a special border Jaeger.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting, held in connection with the Vala event, involved five veterans of the wartime border forces.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans to attend the event were born in 1918.
A lot of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit, since the beginning of 2014.
The unit's operation is invisible on the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief Officer is in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less leave the place of the whistles until they received an alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in the country.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation, leads operations nationally.
As the name suggests, people work in PTR units from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, alarm task database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author forms a certain image.
The placement can be done either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA unit employees do not go up collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
Both own and criminal methods are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police publicly state the methods if they anticipate they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the method of marking empty dwellings reported in early summer, used in housing burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really traveling.
Pre-trial investigation material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The most clever order the district court minutes, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves in our hands.
For the case, an interview has been conducted with Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
This is due to a reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken as early as 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
ISIS-related schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, a base for the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just while planning to escape a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others that there are real risks involved in leaving for a war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland's Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicts with "some degree of certainty" Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "squeeze the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "cashmen" and "possible."
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, rich in nudes, is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start introducing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill out a comment section with irritable insults written by the nickname EiAll LonelyMiddle-aged Men, note that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken re-emergence of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 year olds who buy records is less likely to.
It is also not just a question of collecting enthusiasts, but includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would say livelyly before I stopped, form a cup of my hands, and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it more closely."
Let's take a closer look at this.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies now fill buildings with independent shops in the past - a handful of stunning specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again the ones he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers she encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back in fashion and who have had the need to buy back their old records.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl wake-ups of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar disc covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage lucky days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the record stack.
An April ICM poll revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned while browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "reward" perspective of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at Sounds of the Universe (calculator: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large part, but it definitely happens.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
Not parents, but younger people, late-teens, who are just excited about it.
Foppi, which now has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned movements - from speakers to fresh Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisational jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching the various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collecting isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on the computer or through something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm studying denim shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before Dad and daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with albums by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyls".
But given that even the slightest attention these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths to get more, there's not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the proportion of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or in the office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television host as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the harm, says the record is for a female, who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five metres long.
French court rejects application to dissolve shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
In court proceedings this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect agency argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there are no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 temporary shops, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people living in "extremely uncertain conditions."
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's coffee shop.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would "be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food in Finland is sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland in those EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
Only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are shown in Statistics Finland's writing by Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed down by the Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a haven of affordable food, although the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made at the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer quite the same.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already being read in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how people try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), known as ice sharks, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic clam, the oldest known individual of which is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to follow-up, only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetre Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice shark females only reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 - sellers will not be deducted
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The partner companies in the company that got into trouble ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of the support functions are offered new work as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of these, the reduction need was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction in the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store trade profitable are behind it.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store transaction still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not achieved the goals set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex in particular.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter revenue and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
Rain showers also occur in the central part of the country, but further south is the pout.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shaken by doping scandal - coach's rapture strange explanation
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was an athlete for the national team in a doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to Anzrah authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crimes against Kenya's national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner has any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is in advance Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only went with an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, following athletics.
A battle for athletics medals began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of first-day morning tickets and 65% of evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheering people.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands for rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000-person stands were only filled with about 30%.
The bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not able to pull out the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, a clearly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over 1,000 euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium had empty seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
Thereafter, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem holder rights to the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire for payment of the holder's right.
The holder receives a veto on his 187 square meter block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Obtaining a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go and carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The person who acquired the right to manage receives accurate location information from their block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website is home to the name information of the holder rights acquirers on the same map where the country block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees only the risk of its nature conservation acquisition that the Foundation's operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is established as a foundation of general interest, the purpose of which is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It mainly finances its activities through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the worst of the major cities - see situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and parts of them stolen per 1,000 inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January to August this year based on bike theft reported to the police.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti also reached the top.
Police reported that four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants occurred.
In contrast, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, in proportion to the population, there are double the number of thefts compared to others," says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much you move around the city on wheels and how many bikes you have at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäinen.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In all of Finland, the police have been informed of slightly fewer bike thefts in January and August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts annually.
That means 50-60 fillars every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're in big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime for bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police will be solved.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations when, for example, there may be stolen wheels in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bikes are stolen from, for example, the bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars of shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Like previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale via the internet, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad a lot," Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may commit a concealment offence or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of his workday.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk in that way."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nodded against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a Helsinki student says of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such rag-Jopojas."
A bike was stolen from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to usurp it.
Under 15 years old to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try peer-to-peer jury familiar from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written for the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them are guided in a more responsible direction by the young person's actions so that not everything would be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not come before the adult panel but reflects on what has happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, a service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of children under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that keep on the path you choose," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it.
The letter is directed at the Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told about the details of her economic policy in the United States on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy will go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-hold for American workers who suffer after factories migrate to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder's people, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president], I am against any trade deal that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program released by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it "popular only millionaires like this."
Clinton has previously called Trump's loop loop loophole.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner herself.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making products himself in America," Clinton said.
Such are Rio's ratings: The races have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued 12 percent of the population to the screens at best: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
So far, the most interesting Olympic sports have been Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race opened rack gymnastics, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time by nearly half a million spectators.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that viewers are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 viewers to 500,000 all that time, that's a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts come at night in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone thinks it is lame now - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the early races, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're going around 200,000 downloads now.
"We won't get the online ratings until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the defects have been fixed.
Rio Arena has been associated with a delay and other minor technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more widely visible on Yle's channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and Yle Speech broadcasts races on radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Risinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology dive trainer Matti Kannela found a press of about 20 square metres on Ristiselkä, the depth of which the diving computer looked 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great Lake Yuka, 23 meters.
Looking at this, Päijänne does not get into the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14:29: Corrected last piece with the deepest lakes in average depth wrong.
Ihalainen on tax pay: Pensioners' taxation continues to become more strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more strained than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances came to light in the run-up to parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in Parliament who grilled then-Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) on tax cuts is mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with difficulty.
He says that sticking to a deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Infectious to prolonged unemployment in a rune
Ihalainen appeals to the government to address long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reportedly in Thailand attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to cancel their trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator was not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, on the other hand, there is an ethnic-national conflict surrounding the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says that the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, popular with tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, four bombs exploded at night on the holiday island Phuket, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current data indicate that they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at a popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta that controls Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Security Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Tank about caution, Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half hour.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia with a third 58,665 point performance.
Biles, 18, is still pursuing rack championships at the Rio Games with a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the extent of the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the year before.
In the US team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at Biles have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the avian influenza, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this one is hardly the case either.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work as usual this morning.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
By half past three days, traffic at Patong had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the attack site.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for description hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
Police thank those who gave the clues.
Research leader on Russia's leadership changes: Clear step aside
Russia made the highest-ranking leader change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has been replaced in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbiji, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Interior Minister's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Director of Communications tells the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the prestigious games.
He injured his hind thighs in the early part of the season and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been a complete preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key point," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dress samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Poria Bolt, underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era where athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres by 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors in the final period of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career with a cap on the clock.
The world records of 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes it will be created except Bolt himself.
On 100th, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens' 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has never lost in the finals of the prestigious games since his reign in Beijing, if he has only made it.
In Daegu in 2011, the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to the start of the fraud.
Bolt will be 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Traces of banned substances were found in Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female ester Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-meter mix with his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in a mix before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic dating commentator Helen Skelton laughs in the quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti's website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revelation - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and little noises are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to be startled and perhaps startled, but he insists that he does not want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from wearing (the host).
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests for suspected terror
Rio police announced Thursday that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with security surveillance of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages that urged violence had been distributed on popular WhatsApp, among other things.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
Police let the audience in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blast mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only let the audience in the hall after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
Spain, which started the two races with two losses, won Nigeria by 96-87 points.
In the previous two games, Spain reached silver.
Police completed the controlled blast mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling finish site was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their first-round game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine lady dressed Petäjä-Siren - Finn pondered protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, then, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last because he didn't want to be in Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left at number 27 with the crash.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
The crash had little effect on the tip.
Friday is an important day when you have to race for departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things Science Says Extend Your Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to spend a little bit of money just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to determine the secret of long life through a variety of studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
Science says that all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "decreased risk of death," especially in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol is again advocated by studies that suggest that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can prolong a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway examined how laughing affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise brings extra years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute passage.
A study by Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete who got into medal positions at the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, he's more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring extra years into his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which in turn allows for the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 found that a person shopping daily was likely to be less likely to be older than shopping.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring death forward.
So, put the credit card down from your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpihuma derailed into a truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car cam crash took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in Koske, between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came up had drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left standing in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and from then on over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was squeezed into her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post sends loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's range of loose candy had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So unless there's traffic in the lawn mowing, the sign said.
The merchant's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The grass cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
Media representatives have also been calling all along, and the attention this has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few laari were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed into the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her own loose candy favourites in the selection.
30 pounds of lightened Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slimmed up tens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost some thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos of his soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after pair has garnered several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're great, though.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Doing It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I am on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds on the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then 10 pounds away.
During the three-month workout, five pounds eventually fell.
Hope of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and petitions with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and fearless of work.
Dear Friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court gives Posti a sentence for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimates in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the retained salary and 2,000 euros in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have withheld only part of the employee's salary, which corresponded to the share of induction in the work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had followed the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU on the ban on induction.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter, the Journalists' Union previously asked Sipila and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin dismisses head of his regime - replaced by Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin reports.
The grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will be involved in specific environmental and transport tasks, according to a Kremlin statement.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record man for football moves is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was banned from playing from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors like to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think so.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to last year by 5,000 people.
This year, the festival will feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to fund something in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge fairways.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated so that there are 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grass-decorated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, the venue this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the big visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creise things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is tick legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wildlife living in Asia, tweeted a eloquent picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which is also popular with Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say that the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police have recently been taking a lot of action by criminal organizations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to take up combat missions until several months after the military oath is taken, according to Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Defence Forces training manager interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat in a war situation for 5.5 months.
According to the chief of education, the service is first assigned to the reservists of the emergency forces.
No conscripts or reservists are assigned to a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations even during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for the mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after trading, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and court of appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court's ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 in price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to reimburse the couple's legal and settlement costs for a total of EUR 47,344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the apartment had already been known to buyers when the housing transaction was being made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the obvious building errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up any repairs.
He had the idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the condition inspection report were not detrimental.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate control of rain and meltwaters running along the rocky surface.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained in the notion that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be slightly controlled within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, was due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air could also be reached indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows for health risk and exceeds the limits were found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also debated whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit before the transaction.
The terraces, among other things, had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of the information they received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
The Court of Appeal did not consider that Tola and Waroma had any particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how a total of 218,500 women have been stored on microfilms in the U.S. National Archives in Maryland, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency operated under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the issue.
The breed office investigated women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "sparate", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum reports.
Instead, Nazi population politics focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for having children.
The German mother's honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "Non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.

Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first departure of Finnjollie Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the tail of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures at 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Fairy Talelinna was recorded for a couple of hours a night's sleep: "I was so stiff"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite artists of Finns for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's bartender to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to bounce and she is currently in a wild lift.
Jari Sillanpää, a book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to total rise as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang bars, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stiff!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
Recording a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately guess that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand the perfect and the top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence surrounding the man's most popular paragraphs, as reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner and the case eventually ended up with texts from You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song words ordered from Saara Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridgehead had imagined himself to be making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words in the song about the breakup were not true, but were written based on the news in the 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper's news reported that Jari and his ex-loving divorce were caused by Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a complete bunny and was not true.
Jari, according to the book, played furiously at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdoms out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the gap and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls on the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" flew into the scrap booth in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics takes answers from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right brit.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly critical of the BBC's equity, which gave as much room to only a couple of percent of economists representing the EU's withdrawal as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations think of the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face to face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not feel they have common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will congeste your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each café has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British person get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would real British children get a place to go to school if they were eliminated?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they took off?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said Aberdeen was preparing for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or a camp in favour of an EU withdrawal, began to be prepared for more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went on to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trade
When the camp that supported the EU's withdrawal won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
These together robbed the situation and put the matter in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good due to the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is now worth withdrawing the money in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the ad.
Since then, it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds.
However, there were many surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate fund trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures control about 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its London-based properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its fund in 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been swirling downwards, but the situation does not look more "loose" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is also 15% sales in the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought negatives to London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m., things didn't look very much like that yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power word was in it.
I realized that this is going to the side of plan B now, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work immediately.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally set to be silent at the office, filled the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell of his breakup.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, or as a Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared well for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, and especially in London.
London office premises were anticipated to have up to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still rife in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains open: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The data of CBRE, a real estate service company, on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3% from June to July.
The London City office buildings accumulated 6.1% of the minus, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have there been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the equally large drops hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite apt, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also found normally.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he thinks the price correction movement is no wonder - that could have been the case without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world's number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment targets abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price increases levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much in the future, but says that no upswing is expected.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more stores up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group said today that it is starting to collect more detailed information about its regular customers' purchases.
So far, after data has been collected on the total amount of receipt, the group will start to collect it from the purchased products in early May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing under permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
He said Kesko would not react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and there is no such program planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own 1st Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined by Valintatalot, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product groups, we will remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made in and on what day and the customer receipt total.
We haven't gone to that level like Group K or Group S," says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program was to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same household and their role are also registered.
The S-Front Card Purchase stores the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodi Terros and ABC chains, data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in bags anyway, whether you like it or not.
The willing person can check their stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings that burst into gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online store main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs' duties is mail via Helsinki Airport.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made an online store at Helsinki Airport from shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo to about 300 finds related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will have a big benefit in the future as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to training with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila returns a cover that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "detach" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work tasks at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron the dog on top of the work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60,000-70000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition at Customs.
Heila was acquired by about 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets first Olympic medal - people get day off
The Olympic gold medal in Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the issue after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds from the push in Rio and 145 pounds from the rapture.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push in the last 175 pounds, as well as in the second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian nodder Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power for our team and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With over ten player agents, we went through over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora from Tallinn, where she scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS as early as Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovanieme people will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS was needed for a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Dead Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern Family comedy series as Alex Dunphy, is once again blazing by introducing her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making her style and behavior much bolder.
The star has posed in her social media photos in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of itself celebrating.
If the picture is not visible, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
At this time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard," one woman said on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, anneals a young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured in the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract Japanese people to start Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in autumn and continues well into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times fairytale," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed more than twice as much in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fid's master class leading to gold
The UK's impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's final challenge in the Thursday night final when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in reading, chewing, evasive, supporting game, running lines and sheer force to win gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of British Day - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby start tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semi-final from South Africa earlier that day may have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 people in this condition.
The UK may - but probably won't - be comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, they, coached by Ryan, lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently combating British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish area at an angle.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it was just a slow-motion for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left in the watch...the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the situation was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
The UK made dozens of changes during the break, blocking Fiji's dam...for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fiji's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored for the UK while scoring at the left corner and narrowing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute goal had a frosting in Fiji's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fijians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had scored 20-5 in the Japanese semi-finals, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final, each scoring one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with dazzling legwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of England's 15-aside rugby team, secured the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning into rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these races, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 tough races towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three votes on the boat, and the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the two raced their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's pair race - the first women in the history books of British sports, which achieve such an achievement.
Their control was complete, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting the surface with the sweetness of the swan, does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind each rowing gold is a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands were as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, it was a close situation.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things to cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to have been able to start treatment outside the season in early 2014, when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, Williams was the first in the couple's thoughts to have had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he's a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, as New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very caught in an instant.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to make a good row and win the race, and we did.
The couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to trade Panama leak-wrinkled government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were claimed by protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring's rage will affect the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential election clearly showed criticality towards those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was ISIS founder
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest controversy.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clintonk was involved in the organization's founding.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favored covering of burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone without a swimsuit that respects good practice and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandiosely expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to the extremist organization ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - In Pyykösjärvi blue-green algae seam
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae opacity has been observed on the shore of Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters of bathing areas undercut the action limits set in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health regulations.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcals in the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae opacity observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, forming blue-green algae mass on the water surface in ferries.
The environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, this is also announced separately on the bathing area bulletin board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change in forest space.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest farm size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax change proposal.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be made from the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal assumes that by making a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss in the capital income of forestry that would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the forest's yield value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It is too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the space.
In forest policy, the forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hail surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special chase in Himanga, Kalajoki, on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove in a row were derailed into a ditch, after which the one who came in the back collided after what was ahead.
According to the on-call firemaster Harri Pyyhtiä, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the car behind them, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car ahead was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers towards the Kalajoki River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results by researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
Observations by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for another perpetrator as well
The threshing of Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both of the convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing at Muhos.
One received 8 years for 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangering road safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle without justification as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a man who was sentenced to a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been punished with less severe punishment be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind, according to the convictions.
The director had gotten off the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled under the leadership, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, only increasing at 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as an ice shark, according to a study published in Science magazine.
The ice shark, or holker, that swims around Greenland in the northern Atlantic can live up to 400 years.
The female does not increase until she is 156 years old.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only a centimeter per year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change to corporate tax advocated by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also decrease, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a really staggering amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's 33th discount.
The inheritance tax would be waived altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The decided environmental standards of the emergencies must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "suffering" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be dissociated.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and from Mexico to a 35% penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program take the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A wave of attacks from the past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronsky satirical comedy, the skin I live in (2011) tops of a Spanish career.
On a level, Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama, centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, becomes the second female lead, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a blunder, but I would say it's pretty clever and literally a one-time wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such characteristic flashiness, down to humor, there is a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a equally heavily played, restrained, place in some places a film with good music and quite sad, with elements for elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still present and gradually begins to be injected into the eye as a pure form rather than a functional dramatic power.
People in the film are affected by illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the scene in question, does not particularly improve from this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a script based on three short stories by the Nobel Prize-winning Canadian Alice Munro.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat even-thick literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably more robust drama, that much big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12 August.
Government tries election gimmick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are made with a lot of crap.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) assert under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
The municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so much that no further cuts are made on these?
Because next year will be an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallups report that the Government Party of the Finns Party is facing a ruffle defeat, although the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of whom will be realized next spring by the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of three governments of about equal parties depends on the Finns Party's cant to endure.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also come to the surface.
First, the new cuts will not come is obscured by the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, attempts will be made to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take in €5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands as early as the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring, what comes will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
These actions did not break the debt
It is quite clear that with the current measures, debt will not be reversed, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it irrefutable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overly optimistic, i.e. there will be no traction aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs more than EUR 3 billion per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt stimulus presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the concept of what is responsible for the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party.
Survey: Municipalities want to be left with a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also rolls responsibility to an individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The county, on the other hand, is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks under the authority of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where further to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed police ran to the fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mille.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a bend curved to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil into the road, which the rescue department absorbed into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 centimeters tall, slim and well-bred and has white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and clues about the lost movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of Parafest's devastation
The downward flow that brought down the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepperi, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The surge flow is generated in the thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its pace towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several downward currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of surge currents is difficult to predict.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child among them who was transported to further care with mild injury.
Air pollution ages Londoners
The study found that Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for the skin's aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London without and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A study by Cac found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel their commutes walking near congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed... pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard by tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series from a better starting point than in memory in October.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common note is certainly better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, the middle anti-combat from the foreign trio, begins his second term in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who performed for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, respectively, a Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now there are already sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The US was setting up a floorball national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM level as floorball.
The sparkle was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM-series with the university during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM-season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to the national team
Perttu Puska, who raised the Joensuu-based floorball club Josban, and the Eno-based Tatu Väänänen were selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play for the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, who is attacking the Helsinki-based Lot, has played six men's national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the femur and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran of Seinäjoki Gaming Brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the Finnish Floorball team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the top six pairs in each series ranking are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäki YMCA and has been among the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a fine arena coming to the nesting stadium.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu said.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki's YMCA E-girls.
At the top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee pads on the ankles, and amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were heavily involved - we were coached by the teammate's father and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural species choice to counterbalance indoor volleyball during junior season.
A song has been played at the beach since the 1990s.
At the toilet, the activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors' SM tour races myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki this weekend in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the two ranked second in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we still lack in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of a familiar audience for Hasu.
In early September, new challenges in civilian work await.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The toe slippers are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at an event for people with disabilities in Joensuu, a major accident was near

There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two tents were smaller.
The accident occurred at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-call firemaster interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Soon two years ago, Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began working as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself really boldly joined the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the Young Food Producer competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation measured by the cost-of-living index was -0.8% over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, with annual inflation in July 2016 being -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple tools that twist facial features, producing over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for accusations that the app advertises a blackface, or "blackface" mask, or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens to some users this week that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a "yellow face," or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's bigger problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with a side by side of a outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme derogatoryness.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be discreet than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his article for Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white male leadership and concluded his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and take forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say this is not okay."
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a Congressional panel said authorities from the U.S. Armed Forces War Area headquarters shaped intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than the events justify on the ground.
An interim report by a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House of Representatives Defense Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among headquarters intelligence analysts who said that supervisors tampered with their assessments of Americans' efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military war zone headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified. They were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"The events at Centcom are impossible to accept - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a spokesman for California's Republican.
Centcom's management failures reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration's high-ranking administrators have ordered the reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as feeling as if Centcom's leaders were putting pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Over the first half of 2015, many headquarters press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack on the recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still in ISIS' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders at the U.S. Armed Forces War Area headquarters manipulated headquarters intelligence outputs to downplay ISIS' threat in Iraq.
Republicans created a team after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, published Thursday, will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense Superintendent has begun an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process of overly isolated intelligence evaluation by ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "longed the release of intelligence outputs", worsened mood among analysts and "did not give enough room for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with "pre-set or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security issues."
The study has other aftermath than just the question of whether US-led bombing efforts in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on headquarters to deliver honest estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a dispute over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
According to authorities, last year Hooker's group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
US wins for fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, holding a showdown with Britain
The day after scoring three goals when the team won Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans won the 3-0 in India.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But this he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game determines who ranks first and who second in their group of six teams.
The first place to be placed avoids a strong Dutchman, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans have sparked controversy with their surprising success here, four years after they were the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) related to the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the goal-making with a knuckle near the goal.
India had come into the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then toured the middle and raced the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the fourth round of the last goal.
This zero game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had let one goal out of each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We are in a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The Peace of Trampoliin in the Middle of the Olympic Frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton transmitted from a archer to a swimmer and gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the queue at the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic and future heartbreaker with his smile pit, could well be one of the names everyone knows, presented in prime time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-mind TV commercials - if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations about its presence in between over the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance until the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medals.
However, there is a certain charm to the trampoline, partly because it sounds better suited to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a flightless fan.
There are opportunities for amusement in the sport, as is noted by the vibration of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jump, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning springboard.
The championship's reachers jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of nearly 30 feet, and they must perform swirling sequences of motion (turns, folds, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
There are 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing in Rio.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
Those who wish for medals must go further, faster, up and over in search of gold - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another taunting line: the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and can even make the viewer cry.
But that's also the reason why watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new ascent, appearing weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but there is no furious rush towards the end during the program, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen space as can be reached at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's competitions will also be held on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon repertoire starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is only achieved by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as the male gymnasts of the United States recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, over the past few months, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said that dozens of unarmed protesters were shot and killed by police.
The videos that have been recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security officials hit young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations General Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model image of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.
After the much-critical elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Numerous factors explain why after years of turmoil beneath the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," said Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amharas and oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by those of the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"The current government has no basic instinct like that," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the Tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
Ethiopia was last in such turmoil in 2005 when thousands demonstrated about elections, which analysts said seemed to have been sloppy by the government first and then robbed them.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and considerable advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of contempt by the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked Tigre-owned companies, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains Obama-based ISIS claim as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy that took over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he this week numerous times insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been struggling to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump increasingly claimed the same in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter release, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump lighten his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took his hearing ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign amidst the results of opinion polls that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Escaped to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense in the past.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism, apparently suggesting that Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "of course I'm sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is cunning about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more gallant in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, published Friday, showed that Trump is following Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally tries to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an ever closer look at the presidential campaign over the past few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to worsen because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the news media on Twitter, which grinds every word he says and is biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to find out about him, saying "They're not going to make it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he is unfit for president.
Previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the Bedford Avenue streetside was too expensive for it.
The store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals lamented it as the last loss in a middle-class renovating city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is overwhelmed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of an old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-chicken egg cheese sandwiches, and the coatings offer capers and browned onions, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There is no more beer served in the café, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making spices with the butter of my bagelia," he said.
A photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to variation he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would use the cold-drained coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up soon somewhere to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-knit coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home while walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I had longed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depression paralyzing food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to have lunch in his office.
As a delicacies, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as the foie gras pastry, and the Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree, and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffer," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity of their own, they meet at a journalist's dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsavvy lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato puree, and vegetables.
When a journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple felt it was appropriate to discuss eating the depression.
"The dialects were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanutloaf, liverloaf, beanloaf.
They were made from a ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to form your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead-heavy in the stomach," he said.
Years before the recession, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like a eat-so-so-how-jaksat pick-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal book chronicles the ways in which the nation survived the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes such as cereal and boxes became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compilations were tried when calorie intake and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also conducting research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish where fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of converting lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a nearly gilded dining room.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his own stomach.
As the book reports, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only one of Washington's most dreary, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the depression-like eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Inherited is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to sink their spoons into a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe dictated once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "A little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead to be reimbursed for attorneys' expenses in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
A U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the attorneys' fees it incurred in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in fees after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvon. This release followed when a U.S. judge found Merck's abuses, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment filed on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it incurred in opposing the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of laboratory work at the bottom of Gilead's drug active ingredient sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
US-backed forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij, completely near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 winged prisoners held captive by fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, costing 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse had a income of $10.75 million that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster for his book, which reported his career at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, released 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Board to audit the reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were ready.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem, releasing an online video on Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last few decades has done: publish his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very few taxes in the two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also had a tax board audit going on, and that Trump is not "fearing" the Tax Collection Agency, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Today, the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, had a real federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a real combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an affordable, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step way to protect homes and hundreds without being injured by animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Honeyguide Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing the invading elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil, as well as a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted so that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts into a bang and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
One snorting is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel, which removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, vented his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the country area code list provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there "shocked him."
The hotel's recipe was said to be "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code," the employee reportedly said, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "given in" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame," said another publication, which noted that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "unobtrusive" and "refused" Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"An obvious order not to include Israel in the shortcut list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman reportedly said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse the student body, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to proposals by Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out as one group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested, while the Senate voted on his impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main objectives of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
Russian exports to Iran in particular rose by 91.5%, to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"Trade growth was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It is safe to say that last year's Iranian tourists record number in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner crashes to finish with British catching cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner was vindicated in a men's team sprint at Rio Cycling Stadium last night when a British team trio defended their championship from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man as he rushed to the finish line, grabbing the victory favourite from the New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly finishing sixth in the March World Track Championship in London, even though Hoy has since ended his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Sender Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held to in comparison to the potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Skinner, 23, said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and gain fame.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming profit.
Hindes said, "It felt like it was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven of the ten cycling sports in all, both in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be waiting for a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it's not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean that the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be like Hoy.
Kenny's next to compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this one.
Team competition is always the best.
It's won with friends.
Winning alone is, to be honest, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time in a four-person, four-mile team chase.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 world record for gold in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the qualifying times when the officials invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and reach a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been drama behind it, the least of which have not been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the competitive career of big people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on first-night competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the UK's now legendary reputation for reaching its peak at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's meltless future questionable due to electricity contract cuts
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when an electricity company distributing electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory owners is concluding a distribution agreement, so a cut in all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows the decision taken by the Victoria regime earlier this year that the aid required to operate the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year period of support ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa-Alumina Group, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the smelter-free physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to deliver results for the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible performance effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook of the wholesale electricity price futures market.
AGL said it has already "in anticipation of termination" reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ...'s ability to keep smelter in operation or secure smelter-free electricity supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories exit the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the desired September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and modeled for Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just suitable for the Kardashian style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with everyone's favorite entertainment set, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended in a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
It is a clichéd plot pattern of almost every "birthday" of the children's television series (Seacrest utters the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn bunnyjuss), but Kris had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue site.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus was advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is so intensely expected that for the past two years, pictures of the magazine have leaked before official announcement.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities" on the cover that serve as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, described by the magazine as the "success model" of her generation, hit the former category, she is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
In his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of this moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps found behind the paywall.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
The most vulnerable of more than 160,000 people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limit of the community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are set to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippled debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Board of Directors of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened a gun employee in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former software trainee Vincent Bordin of the state campaign on Wednesday in Charlotte, state court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it's not going to happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "brought out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After selecting for the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said the lawsuit.
"There is no need to trigger weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of the second addition" — usually involving gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond to the comment request immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come thinking that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, and to leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: T5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by £16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also so.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play about blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad blocker program are "cat and mouse play," said one of the companies that manufactures such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-enabled pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update program filters to prevent ads again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "such a round-trip battle between the open source ad blocking community and its circumventors has been underway since the invention of ad blocking," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much grief ad blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, which is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after blockers of ads on computer pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it was daily updating its "advertising preference" tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway during Thursday's early hours in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and settled in the dark lying on a road where she was hit by several vehicles," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this," lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
The two similar cases of the past five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In either case - both of which had a person walking in the dark on the freeway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night," the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of negligence after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once had to be inhabited
NASA's new climate model estimates suggest that Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmospheres, could sometimes have had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had drier areas than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals that day to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface largely from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current ones on Earth.
The model produced a story about Venus' development stages that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus probably had to be inhabited at one time, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche coach's job
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey affairs, attributed to the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/chief Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as Vice President and Head Coach of Hockey at Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey matters must be fully aligned with the organization's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the League in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division win, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of playoffs, and the team has not made it to the next two years.
Avalanche's games in the 2015-16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the wild card playoff slot of the Western Conference.
Roy, the goalkeeper elected to the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Labour battles by North Sea oil workers over pay are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, lead negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been randomly arranged with North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume a process aimed at resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh view of the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts, up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees for North Sea contractors by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's reward deduction results in a 10% reduction for contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's largest North Sea labor disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and throughout the country," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in investment in new projects is expected in the North Sea in 2016, while the previous five-year average has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete listing of the rotational speeds of the Pleiadian cluster stars.
The new data will help astronomers understand why star cluster stars rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age, and even its solar system history," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis, said in a press release.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the group were born about 125 million years ago, and are currently reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
At its peak speed of rotation, these growing stars plunge large amounts of star wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by monitoring the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger of whom make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating star properties at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for the theoretical models of the rotation of stars, which comprise both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiadian rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
