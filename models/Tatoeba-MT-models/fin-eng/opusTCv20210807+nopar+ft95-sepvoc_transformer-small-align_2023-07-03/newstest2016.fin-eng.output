9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's runaway in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing report about a boy who left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
Police Situation Center said the boy had been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening Messages at midnight that the boy has been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the back-up.
The boy was found near the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again wildly tore the goal difference with Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to make in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal king turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved to the top of the all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot two hits from penalty kicks and one of the game situations in the visitor Shahtar Donetski's network.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A in the early part of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of knee-drinkled Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the Premier League game this weekend, did not come to the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old side defender Luke Shaw's away game lasted only 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV's Hector Moreno hit the target with the attacking ManU kit so badly that Shaw was likely to break the tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before medical personnel set out to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of painting in the Champions League started Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
The matter was Angel Di Maria, an Argentinean who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been guessed among the season's success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career with his starting club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsKA lost in a B-block match to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Germany.
Opposition party immediately calls for resignation - president makes wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament again, which he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91-year-old, is in full spirit.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely on Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech earlier and now dealt with China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to more effectively register for those entering Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the Home Affairs Ministers' table, according to Merkel.
Teacher admits to shooting girlfriend during emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a slightly colored university teacher, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, as well as saying that the contact details of the close relatives of the dead woman can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found a handwritten message on Amy Prentiss' body and anger page: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said a letter that experts say is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University, Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the voice.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but possibly had problems.
Students said they waited for his classes.
Police at the place of Prentiss' death, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb said he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave at Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
These questions Lamb is no longer able to answer.
After Lamb escaped from campus, police got to him after he moved back to Mississippi, Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb of Brandon, said.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at a few gigs.
O'Steen said his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a shaky bar near Gautier, reports that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing around and throwing snoops at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the president of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night, a candle devotion was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi on Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster of Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected for police now saying Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but a toy and baby products dealer says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months since the holiday season, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the upcoming documentary Back in Time trailer.
The film begins and it comes to mind that I am just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg reported, "For me, it's undeniably the greatest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available on demand, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syria's situation will not be resolved armedly
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict is "not resolved armedly", and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show solidarity and consensus in the context of the Syrian crisis that they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support Survey Results That Show Donald Trump Is Seriously
Some have tried to label him as a wind vane.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to hug Donald Trump away from the top of the support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the latest 11 national polls, ten Donald Trump has been in charge in the double-digit century, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination opportunities.
The election season is only in the early stages.
These results do not mean that Trump will likely become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and began to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popular figures have made a turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson will generate roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "excited" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
Next, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if the authorities' favorite Jeb Bush became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 52% of voters on the Republican side at the national level think the real estate king has the right character for the president.
According to a survey by Quinnipiac last week, which organizes the first party convention in Iowa, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post survey, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who would most likely be nominated for Republican candidates.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: Republican Party voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
At this time, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican Party voters find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans stand for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as support against Trump has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie for each with 33 points.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would defeat businessman Trump with a big 18-point breakup.
It is and that the majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that they would never change their mind.
46% said they could potentially change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants two months ago "rapists" in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompousness will drive Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and damage attempts to rebrand.
According to a new ABC/Post survey released Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose an outsider than one with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour Labour Party leader, will face David Cameron for the first time in Question Time for the Prime Minister.
Corbyn rises to ask the first of six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs will watch closely for his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the Labour leader to stand quietly during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain Air War, has attracted criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A Corbyn spokesman said he "stand respectfully quietly" and that he acknowledges "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow board, told BBC Twon Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and originally less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that line-ups regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "assembled" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Secretary of Labor and Pensions Smith stated that the party was "especially clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced over the past decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "massed" ideas as questions for the Prime Minister, and has received over 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, MP for the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too opposite and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and pricking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow government's financial secretary, will replace her during poll classes when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak and has said that he has approached the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this issue.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further from a political theater that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit that he failed.
Since they began televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator in assessing the leader's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Time for becoming only a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met with one of the first young people to complete the project.

Pound value rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in rates.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and 0.84% against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and rose by 20 percent after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The deal would combine two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news from the rival luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is a key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
Mondi's shares were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations from the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after a sportswear company announced its six-month proceeds before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports director says higher wages could damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, JD Sports' director, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The cost could be directed at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi's field
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first deal early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 trades coming. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide show exhibition.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer a taste in IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, with South and Western Australia making up nearly 30% of the Metcash IGA trades area, with higher yield margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Visitors to South and Western Australia shopping are known to be parochial, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share in them than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts like Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will grab about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. Turnover is from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In this week's report, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south next year and 30 stores in the west, generating $500 and $600 million in revenue in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed expenses base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magella Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which transmits products to approximately 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012. This indicates a reduction in debt financing for operations as sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands up for himself, and has invested more than $150 million annually in lowering prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and introducing a better range of private brand products to market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior," said Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
The younger member of the talented duo, called "Special Ks", Kokkinakis was involuntarily made public about the incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to fire Chefakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat since the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Chefakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another position in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Britain.
"I think that Thanasi is just pulled into the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost because of the cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature to be 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he practices firmly, is in good shape and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the return of the Canberran to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye considering these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of dropping the stream of migrants entering the country.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence in their home countries have now erected their tents and settled on a road section for an indefinite period between inspection posts in two countries.
However, frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants kept saying "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for 40,000 people seeking asylum, who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and the ministers spoke with hope of reaching the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not put its hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases can be accelerated.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also intends to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival point for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, rather than those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: illegal crossing the border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve next week's expected military positioning, but Associated Press journalists at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now captured by police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
Authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a barbed wire-covered train wagon to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for people to handle people and the crowds tried to penetrate inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National survey found Hillary Clinton's leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in double-digit leadership in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (calculated from 58%), and Sanders, second, is supported by 27% (rised from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will be joining the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary elections start, most Democratic voters state that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton supporters, however, stand more firmly behind their own choice than supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she is now even with Sanders.
Clinton is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they'll be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
6% would not support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican number one man Donald Trump says the same thing with fewer Republican voters (35 percent).
When asked in the open question why they wanted her to run, Clinton supporters were that she had appropriate experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president influences a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagree.
When asked who they would choose second to party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek Democratic nominations, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will increase. If Biden joins, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he resigns, the figure is 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voting has increased.
However, when asked what was most important in the candidate, Democratic voters put opinions before voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden does best of the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27% say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically agree.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server while she is Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and says that their general opinion on her was not affected by the matter.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email controversy did not affect their overall opinion about Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider her honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable.
Meanwhile, 55% of registered voters in the country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion on him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in the study involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for foothold.
Republican voters across the country still strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in a CBS poll released Tuesday to 27% in a previous Fox News election debate.
Carson, however, rose dramatically from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well among different demographic groups and is displacing Trump among higher education Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: from last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voters sample of this latest survey conducted in September is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19% support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him at 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood members charged with the death of Baruch College's first-year student
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternity shelling ceremony in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College University in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and a backpack over 13 kg was loaded on his back full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled on the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the paint.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng passed out, but the accusations say they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national chairman Andy Meng, asking him for advice," police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng was not revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy record, Deng suffered repeated blunt object blows to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity compositions when at least one student has died each year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury advocated first five members charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to just hold individuals accountable; if there's an organization behind what happened that approved the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dismantled its contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The interest rate increase will come, and the emerging market will fall, bond returns will rise and the economy will go into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help with timing when it comes to the economy.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first withdrawal, sometimes only 11 months, sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The US Federal Reserve's aggression in raising interest rates has often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are beginning to be raised, but mainly on the trajectory of the time it takes to normalize the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, market participants can see that all the fuss associated with interest rate raising has been oversized.
"The central bank's first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, chief economic expert at Capital Economics, said Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels will be the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
Below is an overview of how some aspects of the economy will react based on past developments:
As seen in the market in the last month, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market is usually on a strong rise of about 14% when approaching the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and normal status has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports Nuveen Asset Management's leading capital strategist Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on stocks is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and can accelerate the recession.
This is especially the GDP that will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 withdrawals made since 1950 have only had nominal annual GDP below 4.5% twice.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain after the third quarter has progressed 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "is this time different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for the central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all growth cycles have so far occurred in super cycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly since recovery has begun," the report says.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting by far the longest since the last recession ended: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
Fixed returns have also been volatile as the market awaits interest rate increases, and the model is somewhat similar to those made about capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are more quickly visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, debt returns will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates causes convergence of returns on longer and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," said Kathy Jones, a solid return analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar's strength and a fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt perform worse when the dollar's rise in value makes their products more expensive on the global market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares tend to be more lucrative in the three months after the first raise," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report aimed at customers.
Companies with strong turnover surpassed low turnover companies by an average of five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 ( percentage points) and the latter 3 ( percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with high variable rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses channel of 'resavvy'
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only imitated the Brit Awards.
Damien Collins, a colleague of parliament, criticized The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing pressure from the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "populate" its content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term 'people sense' - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seems to be the Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I remember directly about when you're actually just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and information sharing for citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"I also think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during a hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a Conservative Tory party MP, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not in any way distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced "especially in the BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside its own house" the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future The Voice seasons from being produced, or to order that the money of the licensees be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales have risen least in August so far, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were confirmed by the use of mobile devices to shop
Experts believe November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown tremendously for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of online sales levelling in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption increased least since statistics began in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales levelling in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it's leveling out, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been considered one of the causes behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times more buyers flocked to their computers to grab trades, pouring down the websites of many traders.
Experts believe Black Friday, which made buyers argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using fashion chains on shopping streets.
Muslims bury penalties killed in Mecca crane accident, Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through streets during first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed Saudi Binladin Group for collapse
Health Department said 394 people were also injured when crane collapsed
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when a crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first dead to make their final trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed a sacred place where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the king of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family building group guilty of the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes killed in the major mosque of Mecca, 29 bodies were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a major mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors have been prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for commenting.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
Around the major mosque of Mecca are dozens of cranes, which are part of the huge building robbery that Binladin Group leads.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi family of rulers for decades and leads major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of al-Qaeda, was a rebellious boy who was banned by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered one million rial (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap-working workers are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
Number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Rupert Steiner, the city's main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovation work
It seems that if you're handy with a hammer or a hook to paint walls, you're in the minority now.
The British are hiring more and more assistants to do do do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that the popularity is driven by the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions made in the store are made specifically by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more one-woman households where more home renovation work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of our store staff are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of decisions to buy products are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt her management team with an equal number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% women in the group, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women for the management team."
Kingfisher reported a bill on both six months of returns and sales after the group took the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three-ace government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to be forced immediately and as a result the country stands on Friday due to the extensive demonstration of employees.
Many people also think that reason stands.
Ask if it is worth a strike when things are going badly anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already announced that they will not participate in the demonstration but will go to work.
In the good old time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring himself a scab would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people with millions of members does not make much of a moment, but it does give us cause to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of things seem to roll on their own, now the unions finally get to the point, that is, to defend the rights of the employee, visibly and properly.
The government may thus want to capture the role of the trade union movement, as membership in a trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's head.
Lappeenranta University has a heavy savings course: Aiming to save 8.5 million, staff to be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings course, which aims to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations for all personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional two million are being saved from other activities.
The Jt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates the actual activity to be in deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million deficit results.
Costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university has a total budget of approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding with our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement at the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks as prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants Finland for railways
Sir Brian Souter, owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, a British company, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first is the commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the line.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Other international companies have indicated their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world will stand by as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
While Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed the central bank was still raising interest rates last week now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are kept at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is a historic event, as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get off zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for lifting, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting a colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "bad" for the first murder and hoped that "you could cancel it," officials said Tuesday.
Gautier Police in Mississippi reported that Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone", but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he did not tell him.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found, along with a handwritten message by 45-year-old Lamb that read, "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killing himself late Monday when he was surrounded by police.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "law or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
O'Steen reported that Prentiss and his daughter were "one-time best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from home. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral dissertation on education at Delta State in spring 2015, according to a resume found on the university's website.
Stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors are that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture to his right leg when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on and he's in the hospital now."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
This is terrible, the boy comes to Manchester United at 18, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it'll take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official erred.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words aren't enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger."
Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw case and loses to PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive for recovery next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible because of this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns something: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax book, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill in the fairly short original text.
"In the city of Tarville within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story written by Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this isn't suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plot summary of Lorax, found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville within the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has been destroyed by greedy, wood-cuting, and need-woven Kerskanen, regardless of the short, mustached creature Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further on the matter at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the English team, but it was still a tough spot
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think that a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't even rule out a away win.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but it involves good twisters and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about choosing Joe Root before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could have done, and it doesn't surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has something as a cricket player that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge field.
He must be given the same chance as others before him, but this of course depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There has been a ball of the idea of Moen in a batting opening next to Cook, which would give the field an extra pitcher but keep four quick ones, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the batter can't hit there, and this left-handed one has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when the first grid fell before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, with the little I've had to do with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished statistics - hitting an average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers available and the electors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games, bringing with him both energy and a relentless glimpse.
I have always thought that he was born to be part of an international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of work to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new votes in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and pickers don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those who support UK leaving the EU (Brexit) can take the profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-wool renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU are facing ever greater problems every day, even if one ignores even the cordial Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to lead the Labour Party or the anger of the trade union central organisation in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic buddy recently explained that because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions that cause disagreements and disruptive treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them either if they erode social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye, and then come home saying they win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', Berlin says - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets ruined in the same way as it happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading power too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain could have a leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves on behalf of the selfie Britons when their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests, some such ministers may even plan to consciously make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a case" and "The renegotiation had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have bitterly experienced how the voracious Fleet Street press can be and how EU skeptics are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest European opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about "EU direct bananas" while he was a correspondent for Brussels in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-foreigned rascals, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought exactly the same way about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a diversion unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when it comes to opposing Cameron's renegotiation trick, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the front at the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he no longer had time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-introducing Neil Kinnock's '80s boycotted Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the British Independence Party Ukip's war goal enthusiasm and the most ferocious nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when her internal Scout wanted to admit that Corbyn's election to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father-in-law was struggling on TV, trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without, however, going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's pinnings were more attractive.
But the struggle for keeping up with "anywhere" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor from all that Corbyn told the principals and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the whirlwinds of social media, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic twist on EU membership (and aligned with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-understand debate among left-wing thinkers for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to dogma in doctrinal squawking.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the launch of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, where some had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this "valbar" report last month, describing it as a "covery review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet published an editorial that attacked the PHE's main conclusion "exceptional shaky base".
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also say in the study that they have received funding in the field.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE Tobacco Director also attended the meeting.
The study produced by the group "muchly admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding harm in most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking children or non-smokers" to be premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made in BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lives die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for such hits as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience in difficult broadcasting times against the most watched programmes by competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time of six years.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC is producing and sending programmes that would be suitable for clearly unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the permit fee is adhered to - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or, in the long run, it should at least limit its production to programs that others don't do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the most important broadcast time because of the desire to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, undeniably inside the house implemented.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't see how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said the BBC is guilty of hunting ratings "due to the goals of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky Director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programmes of a smaller audience "go to BBC4, where often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and then can hypocritically state, in defending the £4 billion licence fee revenue, that 'Of course, we are making all these unknown programmes that no one is watching'".
They put them on a mission location where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the permit fee, Johnson said to the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is big money because they don't spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith-era mission "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as training - he said the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the mission to "information, educate and entertain".
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says are only shown on television by some, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these could be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound wave bursts.
Tiny shuttles change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
Impulses work by turning on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method, named sound genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are passed into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttles do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasonically controlled shuttles, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, microbubles amplified sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turn on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to cause the targeted human neurons to momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's weapons fair.
Horrible killer machines!
Ankle-crushing leg traps!
Grape pombs!
As well as electrical stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no marks!
The cheerful voice and the imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody that Amnesty International produced to highlight the British government's willingness to trade weapons to oppressive regimes at the ExCeL Centre at the London Shipyard Area.

With a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and metro trains that require a closer look.
"An important announcement, Will you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together is asked using a London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a tank image.
This September, a herd of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. It is a six-pound pack of hex keys that the collective says "gets access to one third of the advertising space for bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "declarationalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance breasts when they have realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another anti-arm store poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours, created by the free advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic shady corporation ad, but "it was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in connection with the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL as exhibitors sell fantasticly embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the U.S. military for "the AT4CS RS that is launched from the shoulder."
This includes a "unique tube bet warhead that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory at an ignorant age of 19, and that's when I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the forced smiles of the people I provoked and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything that gets on the nerves to a completely scary one.
It's tempting to babble: tell you where you're from, whether you liked the gap year and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why "I really don't really love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHA finds me in my room".
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not the ones you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and high places to spend time, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of hiking from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you now have to leave so I can collect back the energy I spent while talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when there was a speech: knock.
A guy in my student dorm felt that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start college during the peak season of baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cupboard, and introducing yourself seems to some extent less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile as I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more than my dorm buddy who mixed detergent with their milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that pot of proverb beating the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music down because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.

Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory with you?
Or, in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a dorm partner your future spouse, team up, split up, and then see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your bottom end.

A racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kitee - House planned to be a reception centre was smeared in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the residence of foreign students on Saturday morning at Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police previously reported, it is not the accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kite Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, says the Eastern Finland police.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for the social guarantee education of young people at the Folk High School, there were an estimated ten people in the building that was vandalized at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The folk high school has people from 12 different nationalities.
They have been students in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a-status.
Some study in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some study Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
Luukkainen says the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators are suspected to have been at least three men and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend night, as this topic has now been afloat.
Nothing more serious," says Luukkainen.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
MTV said on its website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a crime report to the police.
Focus 15 September at 4:02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of the people who lived in the target building.
State shuts down Y train to Karjaa - passengers hungry, "just idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Raseborg Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news indignant passengers rising to the early evening of the train in question at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the shutdown strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing more than political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in HSTV's interview video that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains running on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of service.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved later by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-Raase Porians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the urban area by train.
"It's specifically miserable for those who have to plan their journey again," he said as he climbed the Y train.
A little relief is in store.
A new train connection is probably coming to the beach track, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. takes you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring more costs to HSL, i.e. practically the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year for the Y train, the Ministry certainly pays much more than this.
The R-line on the main track will miss two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train services doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, the Port of Kouvola-Kotka and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made per year, while the total number of trips in traffic purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring savings of 12.3 million per year to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book Capital Timeliness: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the global economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in the book The Timeliness of Marx's Capital.
"He will be taken more seriously now than they have in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization and intrusion of the capitalist economy more and more widely into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly farsighted.
The book, based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
But the former CEO of the Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is he?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a topical economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and expert in literature.
"The usual notion is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went hard wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx's interests such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big image, a world that is changing as a result of a technical upheaval," Korkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Yet it is worth getting to know Marx in Korkman's view.
"In the 70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as should other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency said.
A UN report on the 1983-2009 Civil War appeared Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses torture, abductions and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
The rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it plans to conduct an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the creation of a UN court because of foreign judges.
England's yo-experiment was allowed to weigh social media
The autumn matriculation papers had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
English skills were tested by over 16,000 pledges.
You could write a subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language writing of 150-250 words could be addressed to the editor of the online magazine's advisory column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is equivalent to the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the subject, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-speaking high school in Porvoo.
The third topic contained only a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire experiment as "quite normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was allowed to answer questions about texts that were, for example, about the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large masses of data.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when the test of another domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In high schools, the test is held normally, meaning that it is not affected by the demonstration of wage earners.
The Student Diploma Board urges the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can attend the trial.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Oulu robbed trade at gunpoint
On Wednesday morning, a shop was robbed in Oulu in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando hat covering his face.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predicts.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police officers at work, in turn, are not only responsible for carrying out alarm and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway market are closed to motor vehicles for the period from about 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from the west direction from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least it seems that enough.
I will not take a stand on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols are coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The exact number of patrols is not reported by the police.
"Something is coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging that private cars be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bundle extends from Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until early evening.
With protesters from elsewhere in Finland, there are also many charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Railway Square.
Buses are at a distance.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of the people, is now partly handled by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed calmly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark in Finnish political history for it," says Emeritus Martti Siisiinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it didn't, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing in contract law.
There are many features here that the trade union movement is indeed being tried to get to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday's protests.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you look for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrosthursday in 1993, Siisiinen says.
Organized in the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho (center) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and wage earner organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government before.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than they were in the time of Murover Thursday.
Besides, there is now the most bourgeois government in Finland ever in power, Siisiinen says.
The current coalition of government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
They're from all sides to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of the demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and police prepared to get pork shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Reconciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metalmen received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Puberty Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many who were made unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
Firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU quits," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers tipped tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually accelerated the negotiations to the result.
Doctors strike 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in determining the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria on board a truck became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Yleisradio, who first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
Captain beating refugees, former drug courier, and deep-rich businessman - story of five smugglers
A submersible king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human trafficking into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at Trento University, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death's Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present solutions, and introduce smugglers from different steps of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them away right away from them.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer celebration.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to Lampedusa Island, which is part of Italy, is only 120 km.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is stuffed full, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again blazing with the refugee crisis.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go out with lanterns turned out at midnight.
The first night, you drive off the islands, then stop, wait the day, and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He says he's gonna have to assault his countrymen for this.
I'll beat them away from them right away.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and anyway it has seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 people about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly accessible to families.
Men travelling in the surrounding forests without their family stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
Families who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia also live in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings of borders and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When eventually arriving in the Bogovaða area, a large human smuggling hub, people are dying tired.
Goran's rides are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He said the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Nonsense nonsense all the way.
First, for example, the price is 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and only charge 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about three hundred kilometers away, most of it comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia a very nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his rideers a mile from the border.
Then he points the right direction to his clients and swoops away.
In the work of mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, visited by many believers who have fled the Congo, and a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he is doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear peeks elegantly from under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will initially call one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that it is a good idea to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in a lot, and pass among the peddlers crossing the border.
To obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be told that they come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their home from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID is destroyed and another one is acquired.
This is helped by Missionary contacts with Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where even real asylum seekers go: asylum-seeking procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the United Nations Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he has come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation around 150 euros, and moving to a European country, for example, €4,500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irish 40-year-old is on call off the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving the A26 freeway and trying to avoid the police.
If police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would be jailed directly for arranging illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck - you have to make sure it's on its way to England, not to Holland, for example, and cut the safety wire on the protective cover.
You have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent a police thermal scanner from noticing the hideer.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not be squeezing the salamisters, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporika, the Turk has been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: yachts are rented from Turkish ports to supposedly take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded into crowded Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of €5,000-7,000, first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for these to leave.
People are stuffed into minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you have to board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden throughout the journey under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately 53,000 euros for one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are held and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through covert companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Member of Parliament of the Democratic Party of Turkey and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Correction 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
American Olympic runner tells of his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-meter runner who competed in the Olympics three times, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top from the very beginning and defended his leadership position on the manic race.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength ran out.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of making money from having sex with foreign men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he missed the kind of adrenaline spikes he had when competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was revealed in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was the world's number one statistical number in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Finals.
World champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski cock under control: "Direct-back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have twisted the whole summer and autumn, as last year, about the athlete contract.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski cock under control.
"Thank you for pointing at the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season's national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was delighted to represent an alliance that also takes care of future generations, and does not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, affirming that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the World Cup as well as then at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in his career, two of which are golden.
He was part of a team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
Baking Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25 September, there will be events in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Baking Translators Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is intended to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa at Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant will participate in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will take place in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complained from the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of Kauhava, now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the area still has permanent critical infrastructure during the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, i.e. Suomen Separate Networks Ltd.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, the placement of the reception centre in the same building entity would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in relation to the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that negotiations have been held for Kauhava Airport for the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This issue has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties with his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to be a tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched on in the discussions.
The president did not take a stand on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia says that the aim is to manage the operations of airports during the work stoppage by a supervisor.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to Railway Square will be closed to cars from about 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Unioninkatu to Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police say the lockout period depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers will participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told the STT this evening.
Most of the starters close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Posti's services.
Significant delays can be expected, among other things, for the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
Blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
The aim is also to handle meal transports, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information on the services can be obtained from Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Service Trade Union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to participate in the trade union demonstration.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores are kept open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information on the possible closure of individual stores yet.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Helsinki day care centres do not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are normally organised.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to announce further changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the recurring way of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches will be.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be conveyed on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
Now we will use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio talk be given to citizens.
This set of issues, which is now being talked about, is quite complex and requires a longer argument.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21:05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it at Yle Arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television speech will not tell of a more general government turn inward.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly in one's own hands and to refuse questions of public debate? discusses Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
Reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not interrelated.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not announcements in a democracy.
By definition, it is up to the media representatives to try not to take agendas of politicians as given.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more of what we have already heard today?
Or can he speak differently, differently, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
Ylekin takes a risk in this sense if it is not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled a media for politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interests or general line.
From Sipilä a cunning bet
In the upcoming speech of Sipilä, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and what is not," says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring out his own view without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a briefing, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something from the speech, because more specific questions will not be asked.
Kuut says it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat is dripping, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform about something, because here a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners do regularly.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo gives the Prime Minister's speech to the public very exceptional.
He said that this had not happened in decades for the Prime Minister to speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Employees' organisations will hold a demonstration on Friday and strikes against government actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide endlessly," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of the discovery.
The boy's father updated on his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped me find it.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was split closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed by violent fad of young people: You'll cause anger
Kurdish-based free fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, which appeals especially to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a weighty speech against street fighting among young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking me to look at an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the fad of the young.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick those on the ground, sit on another, and hit without thinking about any of these consequences when you make videos like this," Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting on the street in the first place.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a terrible number of these individual cases.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a while.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get targeted by someone's racism, you're going to have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives stakes to racism.
You guys make me hate that I don't like either.
You're having things pretty bad anyway and you're not going to improve them at all," Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges position on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on Monday on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The staff centre organisation STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented narrowly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
Lyly said SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties instead of forced laws are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: Big demonstration threatens to slump - "It feels a little funny to shake your fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary from one side to the side in an employee camp.
Is the government to overturn or agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders burst into sacred hatred of the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being caught.
The threat spread to the Akavas, too.
The teachers' trade union (OAJ) threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens are completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the Centre of Staff Centre Association STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his compromise paper is already complete.
There was no yard from SAK's office at first.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when union leaders just on Monday told us to put the country standing on Friday.
Eventually, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for wage earners, SAK should yield to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations with the Sipilä Board.
Palola's right hand, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described that the government's trade union expertise has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took some momentum away from the Finnish stoppers, with ACP Marko Piirainen (sd) as their frontman.
It feels a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the spokesman of the Russian Duma, said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki anniversary meeting in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's coercion, such as Naryshkin, to attend a meeting - an issue that the President could remind journalists of.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was not only directed at the United States but also at the United States, where his entry was also blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without complications, so Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who leads the meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already spoken with a Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock meets real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The killer and the Clave continue bull days in Hakametsä today, as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today there will be no actual paint parties in Hakametsä.
Tappara visited Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2 extension win from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at worst from a two-goal losing position.
Tuesday in the lock was more minor.
The catch of the Raumans, who started tangledly, was the guest of the round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play a game similar to last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for Raumans.
In the previous two seasons, the killer has just dropped the lock from the final series in the previous two seasons.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required for a solution.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three alongside and past.
There are no major changes in group configurations, except for goalkeepers.
Both cashiers who rejected yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
With the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lock posts, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Perspective: There's a lousy play going on in an ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the lead role.
The subjugator fought sensationally for the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden-handed pot pack advanced to everyone's amazement to the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became blonde.
JP Jalo, a great TV commentator, called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that the new work of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man working as an aces sports director has built a potaka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in a rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copperinen are due to something other than reeled play.
Toivola has forgotten that Pekka Rautakallio plays the lead role in Rocky VI.
Karri Kivi has crossed Iron Rock into Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy lead in Rocky, written by Toivola as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and petty pigry.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces caught Tappara in the head of Jere Karelia.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I don't accept a game like that and it's not part of the ace hockey, Iron Rock, who was hot, snarled at the People of Satakunta after the game.
The team of the Aces this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, policemen, and cursors.
There are practically no key men in the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smoldering under the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked hard together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuuka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You're Beautiful about the early years of Apulanna is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk Sirkka.
The cricket pushes and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have converged a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would be the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, there was a recession and really dreary.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot from Tuukka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of parents have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's infamous skate story.
Olga was a daily life and a good girl who would have had nothing to do with Tuukka in the movie.
At most, he could have secretly enamored.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that a big joint project is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iiit often plans to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is €17 million.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive play film ever in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being made, will also rise past Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over €100 million.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October near Antwerp at the AED Studios premises and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I am more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he tells Iltalehti.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big stallion too.
However, 100 million could be stuffed into the film, because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no loose one.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond this Wednesday, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trend setters' fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the hoodie or T-shirt brand was seen as a somewhat hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the edge of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already a real hillbilly, it starts to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or mundane fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favoring basic clothes as boring as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey base college, the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet is now being put on top, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable tracker sweatpants, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear edge are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace fall blouses makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
It is claimed that a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo, presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he could to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, in which he seems to be peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in a very good mood and at least not based on their images it is about getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with not going inside the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained that he admired the new Russian technology in the exhibition because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and robust, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stuck have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the weapons show in a few days.
The claim of Zotov's stuck was originally triggered by the Bloknot.ru case, in which Zotov was told he struggled out of the tank hatch while trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him unless he gets out of his pinch.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their own view of what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said Aleksandr Pisarevsky Bloknot, the coordinator of the exhibition.

The (1902-84) Lassen Candlestick of the Architects (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks like it was planned today.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water in the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand basin into a ditch.
The company said measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as process water or passed into the environment through the surface casting field as permitted.
The bleeding was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company says the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report by the International Monetary Fund, published today by the IMF, largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland to comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, chief economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of positive message in the IMF's assessment for government action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be overcut.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Economic Messages.
The IMF also believes that it would be worth implementing growth projects within the fastest possible schedule to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske anticipates today, in his new business cycle forecast, growth will be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the latest observations as the basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was on a small increase in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention may have been paid to weakened industry confidence or other softer meters.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
The report has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made for single minors in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The result of the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were made to lapse because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for single minors.
There are no overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well, he stresses.
What about those who have received the decision to convert?
Will they also disappear into the "dark labour market" for example?
This is difficult for the Finnish Immigration Service to assess, as the police are responsible for implementing conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered country seekers.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who considered refugee issues at the EU Interior Ministerial Conference, announced on Monday practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who has lost his ability to work due to illness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in her field.
The online advert was first reported by the online magazine Evening Makasini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, no more television shows are filmed for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interested.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of her own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonens are trying to move out of their current Myrskylä home.
There's no way we can take all the amount of stuff with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see which things are being abandoned.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up a box of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than thought: Metro and trams could stop all Friday
Drivers of the subway and trams today decide whether to expand the power action in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it is decided whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts are badly stinging drivers, so government plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders that stopping traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area is practically almost entirely at a standstill.
According to VR data, trains will not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there will be no local or long-distance traffic.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pits.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are run by supervisors, says HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, the AP news agency reports.
Sky News says refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
Local media also said the Hungarian police would have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thinks self-made clock was bomb
Ahmed Mohamed, 14-year-old in Texas, has been arrested after a teacher considered a self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, considered the watch to look like a bomb.
Police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to the youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said police had found the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is in police custody, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished on three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is buzzing - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been joined by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has paid tribute to pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully quietly during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided labor ranks.
Among the MPs in particular are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled for the first time today to appear as party leader in parliament during Question Time for the Prime Minister.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was on Twitter on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
Minnesota family killing still unclear - family father awaits lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the house garage.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of children at school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the Short family dead from all over a huge house.
StarTribune said it was possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A million-dollar house and a successful company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the blood acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said there were four million different visitors on a weekly basis.
I have been offered 50 bids for the company over the past ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, success was reflected in the fact that Short's family bought a huge house in Greenwood for $2 million in 2011.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
StarTribune said the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achievement Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achievement Test Prep, Short's site had not removed any blasphemous comments from the prep courses, and thus had lost customers to their competitors.
However, StarTribune said it was very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner three were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great," Loiri commented in a good mood on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with a win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri ruffled.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The biggest athlete's ever donation"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest individual donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed a contract with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing its name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer investigations.
Japanese cafe can be ordered for a wife for tonight - serves food with nothing but bikini and apron wearing
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the social and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
From the Tokyo-based Ore no Yome café, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It is a waitress who pretends to be the client's spouse.
The "half" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is just up against the apron and bikini, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a statement published by Intel.
The Board is composed of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report based on ASRB's research results in the future.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate is that 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," said Chris Young, Intel Security Director.
ASRB allows Intel to establish best practices in security and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS information now that the eyes of the automotive world are at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finnish terms, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available for order, though when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford will not say in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
In Finnish terms, the new fourth generation Sportage is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, Sportage is rounder than before.
A cent has come to the axle spacing and exterior dimensions here and there and the car splits air more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo has been added to it.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to the sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat will be able to reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
The start is with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine Optims.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - rattled in a bold overall outfit
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pants suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the singer star's graceful waist.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year hiatus, the singer who became a mother has been able to lose their pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
I am not really nervous about getting back on the stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break.
I have missed all the music-related things, the singer says.
Chisu will release their new album, Polaris, in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, you wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes again - now you see the breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics one after another.
She presents her pregnant stomach and breast equipment readily in sexy clothes, last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian from a show at husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress as the flashes.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity uniform was when she visited a friend for dinner in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was highlighted by black overknee boots.
The third special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation shift had a pregnancy stomach.
The Hard Laws of Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the notion that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths out of the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Each season starts out of nowhere.
Even if you have posed in top designers' costumes the previous season, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and the mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are sought after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one type of thinness.
Agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time serve as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the difference is sad.
Models want to be in this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Even models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes models feel like they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Weeks, where designers will reveal their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who has changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band's founding member based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I am a 26-year-old rapper, and in this film I am playing a 16-year-old guitarist.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people about that group, so I think it's good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to make an impression of a person.
A man piloting Scrooge Salminen and Dogs doesn't go to the role.
Punk manners come naturally with the man.
In the punk episode of the Stars, Stars program, many certainly saw a foretaste, as have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything tiny, but we always go to the fullest.
The main actors in Tuukka Temonen, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apula from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core group familiar to the band's audience is portrayed by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has posted a photo of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, seen earlier in the mustache and jaw beard, has shaved his face into smooth-posc, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to reach Europe in recent days.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, advises.
Smaller children are worth protecting, and not, for example, let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay spinning in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
It is not worth scaring the child in vain, even if you are harassed and scared.
A younger child closely follows their parents' behavior.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe.
Older children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
Parents should bring it up with them if you are thinking about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with the children, can consider how this is viewed in our family.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If you also talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
The ball lightning that strikes the vermo is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone the Pila Ball Salama for a smooth blow in midsummer.
It only ran profits and second positions until the end of July, a collapse occurred in the Tampere raves.
Since the stallion thoroughly froze, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his protégé time from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest end, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Ball Lightning had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku in its record time after Taruntuule.
Apila's Ball Lightning was very under pressure from the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Given those things, the small deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
Coach assumes that a proper competition made the stallion a blade.
The horse's tune certainly went forward from it, and I hope it would have levelled off as well.
Apila's Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, instead, the stallion has been disconnected by such a lightning kiri that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, fellow competitors cannot match the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
The wishes of the Nordic region have a pee race in Vermo.
The other thing, however, is how the Ball Lightning of the Epila agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and you might even pick up under the starting car boom and all that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than the departure of Turku.
Apila's Ball Lightning can also come from the bow while in order, and we're going to drive it for a win," the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple is possibly planning to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a number of programs that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complicated than the top looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work closely with other programs.

Eurozone inflation waned to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, by 0.1% year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, inflation rates were 0.2 per cent.
So-called underlying inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
In the EU of 28 countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in the euro area countries, or 1.4 per cent, in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus sign according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Eurozone inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a 2% price increase in the medium term.
The ECB predicts inflation of 0.1% on average for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
US Fed to try to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed starts raising interest rates again.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted to start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next recession may press on at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that is what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have been the custom - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, strategists of the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not think they know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may result.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand the rise in interest rates than at any time before since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to start a recession
Leaders who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its current tuning have been implying throughout last summer and early autumn that time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in over nine years may come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its so-called Fed funds control rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage point interest rates ended exactly two years, with which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversity in financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than has typically occurred since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than at any time since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world's largest economies, as well as the twists of financial markets since the 1950s and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact are making clear since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the start of the recession has been less than a year since the first rate increase, most often less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one year-two of the start of the Fed's interest rate increases.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has deviated from others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively scarce in the review, so they hardly suggest anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably discovered even through decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They patched the marks of the techno bubble, and at the same time grew the following.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and already too high grew even greater as a result of central banks' excess monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history to date was born.
3) Crazy debt financing, which has been almost unsustained to the financial economy in particular, inflated to most aspects of the financial markets, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities to date.
Nor does it create a very harsh dispute that the financial markets, which have risen to an ever more complex leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
The financial structures, let alone valuation bubbles tuned to debt leverages, only lasted for their time after interest rate purchases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned to an increase.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give cause for an inch by mentioning such points as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower even longer.
2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time, but now debt money is at its lowest literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load in the financial and real economy has not eased, but now there is a heavyer debt load in different parts of the economy than before or half of the financial crisis before.
3) Liquidity, which has become more profused and cheaper from central banks, has mostly remained in the financial markets and has slowed key types of securities and assets to the most expensive, whether the peak before the financial crisis or ever.
And the strategists are not just flattening the mood with warning signs in the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession to the pattern that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state but similarly the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money taps to a tighter level.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, a strategist of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has been coaching the bank's international investor customers for the following turns in the Fed for some time:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for the Fed to run out financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer manufacturer, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's business service side, the company says.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focused on corporate sales in November, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest staff in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced by 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers account for more than 10% of its operating result.
The other year, its three most significant customers imported 65 percent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system on iPhone after Apple update release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation, after a "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush hour to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests applications to be deleted and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won't let the update proceed, as if the battery runs out, it can lead to an update break.

Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre) has been a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he has filed a resignation notice of membership in May this year.
I checked and that's enough to file a resignation report.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed schedule," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs' Board of Directors and Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings go through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital are realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in a tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, a private equity fund, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take on the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening of working life.
The organization also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola remarked to journalists during a break from the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) has no readiness for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to the other half of the package being 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm for a party to have a conversation if there's a ratio of one to 100 on the side.
Palola: Negotiation link was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has been hoping for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists, and it has been constructive for him all along.
According to Palola, the operation of the staff centre organisation STTK, especially Sunday supplements, is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to back down from mandatory legislation to implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP that kept the issue on display.
Employees gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work extortion package presented by the Government last week.
As part of the package, the salary of the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be reduced.
STTK stresses that central organizations have invited wage earners to the demonstration, and that the intention has not been to organize a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming along the same lines as Akava, as Akava has already outlined an alternative model for government presentations for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that Lauri Lyly led by SAK will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitiveness leap that the government is seeking as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the government and employers in the country," Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, walkos" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks tonight
University of Tampere Green Left
University of Tampere Green Left Viva bingo coupon for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister in giving a famous radio address that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators' strike by television speech.
Solo call, monarchist vibes
The speech of Sipilä has attracted criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Greens, "the solo call has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for them."
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
Tried is.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered it and found that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, explains Yle's Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle in the news.
Like We at the time of the Tammelas
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
In the evening, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on her prettier cork and Dad matches the tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., we quiet down to the TV like before in the time of Me Tammelas," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell why there are millionaires hiding capital in tax havens in the Finnish government, who are drafting amnesty laws for his other tax-teller friends and at the same time telling the people that it is necessary to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is made by Viva, the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It has posted the bingo below on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, common coal, living in debt, and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to relinquish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan for al-Assad to give up power in style after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian ambassador Vitali Thurkin listed three points plan for him in a one-on-one discussion: the opposition was not to be armed, a voice contact had to be immediately made between the opposition and Assad, and the abdication of Assad had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree with all things, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he conveyed Thurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Thurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has officially supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Thurkin spoke under Moscow authorization.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some Assad supporter.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers' Organization Centre for Tyrky to Tornio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in an empty Tornio joint lyce building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a place suitable for the need to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of the Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to the STT.
Of the 43 delegates were present at the discussion.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and the matter was reacted quickly.
The joint agreement could accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), halving holiday money in public would only handle part of the calculation of the price of labour sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to take an alternative package with him if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a thing.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for compensatory means of government-reported extortion of working life.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving holiday payments would be a means of action, as it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the cut of Sunday supplements planned by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday money, as they are recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will continue to inform Parliament on Wednesday next week of the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work will then start, i.e. the train is on the move and it is becoming increasingly difficult.
Now is a great time.
It will not take long for such things, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the pay for the first days of illness is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as a mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The employee central organisations will organise a major demonstration on Friday due to the actions, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves expansion of the Mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously but slightly approved the extension of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, or saphalli.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally said.
Also a busy schedule heartily.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
The agenda was still talking about an investment of between €150,000 and €200,000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language is also located in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous steep position to bring Karelian-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of nurturing the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the area.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian-language street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use in the Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in info boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth being open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of them can be used in a wide range of marketing in the province.
Train terminations cut the vitality of the province
Train connections cuts strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether you can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, which has also been a continuation of which has also been under reflection on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is now happening.
The effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example, should be considered, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of access connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun war project is seemingly unanimous, but one gravel voice is also among them.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board (sd., in the photo) proposed a waiver of the entire project at the government meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of trains.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains is left off, but still five times a day you can reach Kouvola from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money for train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely discontinued.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will come into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped away.
The rescue services let a 12-year-old on the roof climb from the stone and could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
That did not stop the crowd of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to help the last person left on the roof safely back to the surface of the last one left on the roof.
FedEx's operating profit twofold, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, due to reduced demand for freight services, and higher costs of its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell by about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the result of the tax year to end next May at $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited $10.84, according to FactSet's survey.
The smaller outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for land transport for heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performs steadily, given the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries for the duration of the holiday were announced the day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra employees, about the same amount it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx had a profit of $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is left with an average forecast of $2.44. The 12 analysts survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decline in international priority transportation in recent years, which has halted the development of its Express unit's revenue.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the country unit's net sales rose by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
Express unit revenue was better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations fell by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5% to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 percent down this year on Tuesday and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
US Federal Reserve decision-makers will sit around a huge mahogany table this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's financial interests ahead of everything else.
Congress has put two kinds of responsibility on the central bank: they need to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a crucial factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from a record incentive brought by the short-term interest rate level that remained almost zero until late 2008 .
While most of the data shows a stable growth in the economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have been made even more frightened in advance when it comes to increasing instability. Fear of how it would be if the federal funds rate reference value were increased by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be followed," says Lindsey M. Piegza, the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.'s chief economic expert.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for maintaining interest rates, increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
There has been no agreement on the central bank's decision, which already creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision makers then managed to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was brought by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they need to go to a lot of trouble in their policy to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank was raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage unit this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would verify the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, central bank decision-makers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of significantly lowered oil prices.
The economy "surviates from even higher interest rates and also needs them, given the tight situation in the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16% of its May record, as investors feared China would slow down global growth as well.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us when interest rates should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks' news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Olier, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and have little information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of what is happening in China," Olier said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concerns of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, hint that the central bank can "reducing" the increase in money caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted the financial market movement that has appeared to be separate from the fundamental economic factors."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, calls for an example to the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Ponen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate determination committee.
The latest turmoil comes nowhere near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where there is fear of raising interest rates because the market will be upset," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a dual requirement, and does not mention economic stability, and as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss a great Thai store?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown
This store/storage opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai Costcona, is a Thai wholesale store that also sells to private individuals.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.

There is also even a car compartment in the store if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes more than an hour to tour all the corridors.
If the trade makes you hungry, you can eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food stand (good, cheap) found inside the store is near the cashiers, and there are several takeout options.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C will probably sell it.
The products are priced sensibly, and a large number of products are sold in wholesale packaging.

Brazilian Pediatric Organization in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breastfeeders
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted on them with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven channel's Sunrise show is a favorite in ratings, despite Nine channel's attempts to report executive revelation on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader revelation failed to increase Today's number of viewers.
The Nine Channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a series of international broadcasts lasting that week, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The baggage of the distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise had an average viewership of 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
Change winds are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thanks for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the 800 Words series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which garnered a rather impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the driving force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a two-fold fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe gathered an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - a small enough win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 spectators, with a whopping 720,000 in the second half-hour.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewer average brings Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's program.

The final trio agrees with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markkoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip into who got the last rose.
However, when we talked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family rank, and positivity as reasons for why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, to whom should it go?", their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markkoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be around him," Markkoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a great partner.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can tell," he said.
I like the girls left as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.
Originally released as "Sarah's Best Alternative to Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayne has many options to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested since he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose for the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first plane kick return when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday at 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next plane kick and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new arrivals a potty in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers' special journalist Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane kick taken by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way from the field after a drop, and later told Australian radio pairing Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at 104.1 that she could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when the pass in his own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed by police shooting rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in a crowd that protested against the country's new draft constitution, the official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus Group is demanding its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into the provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the April devastating earthquake killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have voted this week on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60% chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands group, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second precise low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based Weather Forecast Center added.
Google launches donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being made by the director, Google employee Rita Masoud wrote from her own personal experience, who fled Kabul at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are received by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will respond with the same amount to every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugelief up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
A new study found that the benefits of mildly obese type 2 diabetics from weight loss surgery can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get death information," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss, or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of people in the study have been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is more than 30, they are considered obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut individuals fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI for individuals treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of the people cut, 36% of people with diabetes improved completely and 28% partially.
By comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes was completely cured by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long run.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control" described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The team also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group undergoing gastric reduction surgery, the group who had undergone gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased their haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and had more likely achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had a weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for individuals with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group," and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime, we are forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their lands.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response in the United States caused the chain's violent events.
"After the 9/11 attack, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem is found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, ingestion of hand disinfection agent in children has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in swallowing a strongly alcoholic hand-disinfectant for children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgia Poisoning Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Information Center, cases of ingestion of disinfectant reported in poisoning data centers for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 cases 2014.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap uplift.
Reports say teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are those with added scents.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant can contain anything between 45 and 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few squirts are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, medical director at the University of Kansas Hospital Poisoning Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don't leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand disinfection agent is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand disinfectants at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, twice as high as the limit for adult drunk driving, says first aid medical doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed when he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, a police report said.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
Police consider the plan to be a "flexible nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor Mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths downplays talks about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she makes it turn
Hearts fights Scottish Football Association for Neilson charges, and Warburton is wary of January recruitments that could interfere with team unity
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays talk of contradictions
Rumors have arisen about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more close scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch league leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
Lack of Scots Championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in Holland, and why?"
Because Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scottians also want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to Aberdeen, who played ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard against January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on possible targets for January player transfers, he is wary of recruiting frenzy, convincing that he does not want to confuse consensus with the team.
The former Brentford boss said, "The oak transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment period is the time before the entire season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is associated with Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, the 29-year-old player has had ankle problems and failed to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card condemned by Collum in the past eight months, which was overturned.
Neilson stays behind what he said, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim of the moment," the attacker said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with the "ugly win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, which put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that hasn't won games like this too."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's overall figure increases
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained in 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose to 1.82 million in total.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS) report.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
If no judicial intervention occurs, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison to watch Richard Glossip be executed by a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available places, participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen looks at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
Haän admitted that "you could have laid out his words better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said.
I've told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I will not go through all the details again here.
I can't tell you for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of aiding anyway.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective I think he's going to die from.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters from a police officer who tried to "attract him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to an unauthorized intrusion.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come and get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a decent police conference".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate his spies on his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to a treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been put in a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control over spy claims for a year and a half, and did not want "it to look jealous."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I should not continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he said that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he conveys information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the matter at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps transfer responsibility to more than just coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that that what I'm saying now may make them think about that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it grieves me.
It really grieves me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach frustration has increased with long-term Lidar cobalt research, and late rejection led him to state that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day care procedures "ridiculous" after the mud or clay bath is put on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the race day's grave care, on which the officials started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver guilty of traffic escape in Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic escape after colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured when a car collided with him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to police himself in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-rugby league champion-popular claims that his team's tackles are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrest" on their own side when it unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely could cover up his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualifying. Bennett called the game a rugby league "show window" and said that the two Queensland teams were not "hardly excited" wrestling.
Bellamy defended her team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that her confidence was enhanced by two leading coaches criticism of Storm, as that means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year, and in the last six weeks, we've only been stressing contact in tackles, and that's made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought that side up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play like that.
I become more confident when they say things like this because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more point-rich than that played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and not score?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is off this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-finals in AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man bailed $200,000 on drug charge
A man threatened by a possible life sentence for a 40-pound of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maximovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of the drug to the Solay hunt that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 pounds of drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a possible life sentence for an attempt to possess the amount of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Criminal Court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a $200,000 bail to ensure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily, and maintains his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous obscene images of the children that another user sent her.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When police came, they saw five images, searched the computers on the scene, and found "careful" web searches with keywords used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he "proved himself to be a cop to scare them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundeen Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had conducted searches on the computer but said they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she shouted at her mother, shook and cried.
My mother saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then encountered the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than she was.
Hogg, 23, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking images of immoral children on June 14 last year. He broke his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be entered in the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social services have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of his conviction.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe makes wrong speech to parliament
Africa's oldest leader Mugabe fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them of booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with intermissions as he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the supervisor of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them against interfering with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members involved that immunity would end in Parliament and when they step out, parliamentary immunity is not in force.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and expense cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster growing corporate hardware and service functions.
The expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in expenses starting with the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help businesses move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual revenue will be over $50 billion and will "focus on delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
The division breaks down a company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates of Stanford University, to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called the "The Birth Place of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry based on the belief that strictly limited companies will perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity for this latest problem is that Wilshere's end last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, in the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal's 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider entity since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement in injury statistics will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury can be a prone period when you have to strengthen the body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team as Arsenal begins his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroud to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear sequel to Group F, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson of last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not found in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than women.
In the attempt to tackle the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men's Year, with the goal of challenging a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 secondary school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. The study found that a person's chance of recovering doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved with the likelihood of potential mental health problems occurring if they had mentally healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, style goes past content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is at the expense of inner values - the personal growth and friendship of inner longing - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get you any greater happiness.
The fineness of the Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..."listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often, men who contact us feel they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up from problems, you are seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you attend Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, what's even better if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals against Malmö with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in his Champions League debut, showing the French league champions the way, but the team missed several chances before finally increasing their lead as Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same A-block as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game had not only a follow-up position, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a seat in front of the goal and was later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to work on this season," Blanc said.
This anticipates the good.
We wanted to win and won, although I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after the injury in one of three changes after the team was caught in a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It won Celtic's settlement match when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players deep in the midfield.
But the team offered little to the attack side except Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went by a pinch of Kevin Trapp's goal post.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed a total of five attempts in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-working for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's paint post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour after the season's sixth goal thanks to Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had tapped Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the goal of Ezequiel Lavezzi, which came from the exchange, was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'm gonna put my hat on Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining industry left Glencore, who suffered a commodity price collapse, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cut plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a notification that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in China's economy puts a strain on demand and is wreaking havoc in all markets.
The new entry brought Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4% reduction in Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, which totaled 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing stagnation in China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November," the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Robert Xi will allow for further cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time will allow President Obama and President Xi to discuss constructively on issues with disagreements," the statement added.
With a visit first announced in February, Xi is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the United Nations September General Assembly.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss numerous controversial topics, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted with the injured disbelief, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay", while The Martian's actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to urge people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is a whore that her white pimp hits.
The Dear White People producer demanded rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was posted, social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so WHITE that it hurts."
The tweeting garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes after its release.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when an accurate racial presentation in the media is in the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when she introduced Album of the Year nominees as a Grammy Award winner.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter movement leaders recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional rocker and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and receive a $1 million grand prize.
It has never been a competitor in the competition program that ended its seventh season who has survived all the sections of the obstacle track of the program.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task had to climb a rope about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to figure out the exhausting 4th part of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock for winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's great to think about when I've never made more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after a big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter a fiinal and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he is the first competitor ever to have managed to cross the track.
The rules say money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels grudges about it.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns to season eight, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
MANNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season hasn't been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played the pranker role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins missed the chance to climb half the game from Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they are made," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit made the run three times in the first two innings, and then once again in the sixth and once more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and let go three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to pass in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers surrogate Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first beaten run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-beat night since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back into the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started the innings by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks settled on the right side with a snap of one nest, and Simon was able to burn straight another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood up against, Miguel Sano, a first-starting surrogate who pulled the run of two nests left from right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and leveling runner in second base, VerHage got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the ground punch leading to the double game.
It was a record for the main series: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a security run at the ninth start, Mauer pulled two beaten runs against Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and it was 5-4.
However, a right-handed player burned Sano in three assists in his fifth rescue.
Detroit used Phil Hughes, a rusty man at the beginning.
The Tigers received three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured before the game after being off for more than a month due to an inflammation of the lower back.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to make a few nice passes in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starter hit for the first nest, he let the second nest player Ian Kinsler advance in one way.
The right side of J.D. Martinez's walk in two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting shift, who took himself to the first base with a midfield stroke and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
First base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he tried to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second innings and got one fire, in the two nest situation from catcher James McCann and two fires, in the situation of one nest, from the center Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in pitch readings and fed a running-free third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs for six strokes and a walk in four fires.
NOTES: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was removed due to a strain of the throwing hand's shoulder.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, but was supposed to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's statistic in Tigers is 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a real crooked abscess.
The series of three games from the Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy more widely to the world
The economy must open more to the outside world to promote growth," President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday tasked with steering the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a transparency policy," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading to deepening the general reform.
Supporting transparency while further reform is being driven by more new movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth," Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting market access, loosening of border control principles, urging state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
The statement said that a negative list is created, naming the sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest in.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programs.
The change is considerable, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control over the power it shares with companies, ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to explore new cross-border models of economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
To open up state-controlled sectors, more sectors open up to private donors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also attended the meeting, in a statement published after the meeting.
