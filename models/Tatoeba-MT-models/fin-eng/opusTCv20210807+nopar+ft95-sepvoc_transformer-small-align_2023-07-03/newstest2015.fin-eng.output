The city of Juankoski will join the city of Kuopio in early 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the union on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next be held in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.
India and Japan prime ministers meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with her Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security relations, on her first major foreign visit after the May election victory.
Modi's five-day visit to Japan is intended to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economy in the world.
At the top of the topics of discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership on Monday of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of their country," Putin said.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, whose Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current places, where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so they don't get a chance to shoot the people in the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi repair shop.
It surprised that the crowd came in the early evening.
There were visitors over the course of two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, which means pop is not allowed, Kangas assures.
A law will come into force in Finland on Tuesday that restricts the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply for permission from the Police Board to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is found in cleaning and detergents, for example, but concentrations do not usually exceed the limits.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration, for example.
However, precursors acquired before the Act enters into force may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes by Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of rapes at two hotels is facing trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing at the Glasgow Higher Court.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman as "being in an unconscious state, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision on her own."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands in Nairn on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Higher Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, who strengthened on Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than during Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from its top tune.
The Italian lost three high-quality finish positions and fed only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already taken the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who had travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team starred the tip of the midfield diamond Raheem Sterling, which poked past the important opening goal of the 3-0 win Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with its power.
The Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than the opponent's lines is between the opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who flies the grass at a rate of about 34 kilometers per hour at best.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, a Northern Irisher told how Liverpool have systematically developed a more comprehensive player from a Northwestern Londoner who grew at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start in her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a century, including the premiere of a large amount of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations assembled in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, a new impetus is being sought for pension negotiations from the social partners' own meetings.
The administrations of the employee organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are scheduled to continue.
Labour market organisations have been aroused by, among other things, the dispute over the commitment of the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created this week.
Plier pudas.
The Rovaniemi-based women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped over the league robber Vampula Athletes in Pihtiputa in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula turned five into a 3-2 win of one stretched match.
WoVo lost the last round 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, WoVo's coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoVo's spruce was ragged in that Jennifer Keddy, a 190-centimeter, was stuck with her back stuck on the sidelines.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Despite her thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed WoVo's most firepowerful combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilled Russian passer and the Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next weekend when HPK in Hämeenlinna comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at 6 p.m. in an official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet at the sports college for the second time.
Lidl forges wild figures in Finland

The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that nearly EUR 14 million in taxes in Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment in sparsely populated areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Senior Researcher Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medications may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers reviewed women's health history over seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases, and socio-economic status also contributed to the possibility of survival.
In older women and with cancer becoming more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the likelihood of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as potential reasons.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although treatments as remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old housewife living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen sled parking activities with a town plan in Friendship Park, which is located next to the Hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a town plan for Friendship Park and its surrounding area would be made publicly available at the service point Oskia.
Statements from the Environment Board and the Lapland ely Centre are requested on the plan proposal.
With the help of the change in the town plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of motormobiling activities related to tourism in the area.
A park area is to be formed, which includes the area between the present Friendship Park and it and the river.
According to the performance, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
Refueling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
The sled parking activities and the change in the formula have sparked even loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been hungry for both sound and concerned about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no observations above the guide values have been reported in the studies.
The renewed equipment is also more low-emission than the old one.
The friendship park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further, the hotel's safari customers should be transported to safari departure points by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
The area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also large enough for the sleds, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the east side of the Ounasjoki bridges next to the boat pier.
Friendship Park is good for its location, even because the activities can expand into the Ounaspaviljong area in the future, for example.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city's goal is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the sub-general plan of the city centre, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group of people under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales in terms of their age.
According to a Financial Times report, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the amount spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden industry, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the least amount of money per household spent on horticultural products in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in housing rental or a decrease in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden advisor, says that "for example, plants grown in mobile growing containers are particularly popular among renters because such growing vessels can be included in the change if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a boom in the garden industry's resale, as ownership and wealth of housing increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, after last year's March and April weather has been worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish State Department has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Embassy Attorney and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former analyst at the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main espionage target for U.S. and UK intelligence agencies.
Turkish news agencies said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all the major nations have been spying on each other.
An earlier report on the espionage against Ankara, the main German intelligence agency, brought an angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several successful films, has been cast in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Copperinen in the film 2 nights until the morning, which will be filmed this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her role in Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly Glass Dome.
The male lead in the 2 Nights to Morning film is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Mallorca Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Those who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Board officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the holiday island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by movement and bar owners in the Magaluf region, known for its humid celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several owners of Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. Most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to Mallorca Diario, the online daily newspaper, who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià City Board officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges, and they are being questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper throughout the country, wrote that nightclub owners were angry about the bias of the authorities, which made their business significantly more difficult.
"It's no longer money, it's about surviving," one store owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in magazine headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video spread online, in which an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, island authorities have been trying to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcohol-crupulous pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and Carnage, the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer, was jointly fined €55,000.
Above all, the popular Magaluf tourist destination among young British tourists has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Ham Hamas war and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, at the Pash Daycare Centre, workers removed fragment marks from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart felt that returning to school after a long time feels "a little strange."
"We've had some tough times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire began, thousands of residents of communities in the Saad-like border area had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are skeptical of the return after the Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
The Ministry of Education said more than ten families had not yet returned.
Children from these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was the subject of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not bring any solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of deaths, which said that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter at more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still protected and as fighting continued, school officials postponed the school start the previous week.
"I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most to seven years in the Australian winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures house prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1% in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, price increases during June, July and August totalled 4.2 per cent, which is more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual rise in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the rise in prices.
RP Data results show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent and Melbourne by 11.7 percent the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin's housing markets are the next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of homes to be auctioned, the generally high sales rate and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in house prices will continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have drawn record audiences to Mänttä this summer.
More than 70,000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic pop art works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among other things.
Mänttä Art Week said on Monday that it had set a visitor record when 14,500 interested people had visited the Wait event this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
People have been slapped by doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums will be approaching 100,000 this year.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue well over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in the last few days.
On Sunday evening, the commercial property was broken into the commercial property by breaking the window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from a truck tank on Syväojankatu.
A boat with its stern engines had been taken from the Petäinenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
The inside read the text "OIVA" on the front side.
A couple of suspects steal police had already been caught.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into a commercial property on Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a mark and a Paltamo man in his 20s was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, police captured another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Lost amphetamine brought murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to the Kajaaniaist who was born in 1977.
The prosecutor said the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot with a shotgun the holder of the apartment he suspected of being a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car with a party burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burned clothing shreds, a shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will give a verdict on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter looked like 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me."
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-child immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between son and father was distant.
Henry is currently training for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on a fictional conversation with his father and developed based on a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother's death, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
It was very difficult to read my father.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move over!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to a pub with my father and discussed, for example, the shape of a beer pot or the beauty of cricket punching.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was that smileless man in the corner to me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, thus gaining an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although the working conditions are better today than they were at the time.
Melting plants are a little brighter today but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, with flames, smoke and soot that remind you of the underworld.
Dad used to take a bath and only lie down in the tub, and slowly he began singing to himself as he washed the dirt of the smelter away from himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity that his parents offered.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started to get sick shortly before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through her own child he has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop hugging now!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She's a great mother
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why aren't Dawn and I friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started suffering from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a rough diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult...
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he is immersed in making the theatre.
Next up were the Comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences ("The Fences").
Making theatre offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedies Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only a 16-year-old factory worker.
A DJ noticed him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For quite a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to make jokes on the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while I was living stardom and was on TV, which was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and objectionable, I was able to work at huge events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 80s, both making fun and admiring black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The next decade Henry spent with commercials, documentaries, TV shows and movie parts, but after his 2008 series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len — now it seems you're just pedaling still or taking sidetracks".
Next up was Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught us in school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare subject raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Dating words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it did not quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was acting in the British National Theatre and I couldn't really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems with the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked off the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You are part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry says, of course, in a voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little humor cubs constantly interrupt our conversations as he changes from one impression to another.
Abstinence from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you thirst for it constantly, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but generally it doesn't inspire me the same way it used to be.
I'm asking Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It brings me real joy to sit together with a director who helps shape the start, middle and end of the whole journey, and I never think I want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really fun.
When I play, I keep telling a story, and I enjoy that task.
I love stories.

Kenya to draw up register of officials to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government payroll.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary," the Board of Directors said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will still be paid after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million was spent on wages and other financial abuses of "ghost workers" each month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to account even after a person has died or left his official duties, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reported on the capital Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register in the identification centers over the next few weeks to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format," the government said in a statement.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as this will determine how many people actually work in their duties. In addition, this will clean the payroll lists at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki's result for the 2015 financial year may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is falling into a deficit of around 9.4 million.
Possible means of enhancing the efficiency were compromising on the scope and level of services, as well as the purchases of services, the sale and grants of assets, and the increase in tax and payment income.
The €10 million qualifying target for investments is 8.5 million.
There is no relief in the situation of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the strategy-based goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals made to the management team for preparation.
The City Board's proposals will be the basis for budget preparation at the Council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through the board discussion to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of 'dion' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officials were among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were linked to last December's corruption investigations, which targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large crime and monitoring phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister at that time) said police action was part of the planned action against Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The September first day ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the entire vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter visits, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally children's embroidered shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry says the blasphemous tweet was unauthorized
A blasphemous photo of a Democratic district lawyer was sent from a confirmed Twitter account by Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night while hearing allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorizedly from my account.
"I don't accept tweet and I've removed it," a later publication said.
Perry's backup forces did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a slanderous cartoon of Travis district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury gathering in Austin this month while Perry was on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times more than allowed per mille... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's agency did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was assigned to the position by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he was innocent and called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge in charge to reject the allegations and said that the law under which the longest-serving governor in Texas is accused is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-based monitoring group to make a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly — and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa Election Conference during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself jogging on the lake with the text "Here Is Coming, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again
One of London's most important developers has warned that the South East England housing market has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital London housing has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-level developer Berkeley, said Monday that "since the beginning of the current economic year, the market and the number of trades have returned to normal since the 2013 spike" and added that this has enabled a "stable operating environment."
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought the capital by herds.
According to the Land Register data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about one-fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London real estate a less attractive destination in recent months - some interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric on a possible "carton tax" before the May general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending regulations, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the volume of approved loans decreased in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices, which shows that prices will fall by 3% because the index measuring homeowners' opinion on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of trades made in London's most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped one quarter ago, real estate agent WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from the properties sold to over £2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained high."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profits rose by 40% to £380 million one year ago, thus increasing by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year meet current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the full year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for £23.96.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold pictures of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker for "insolent violation of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will receive the allegations.
The images originally released on the 4chan image release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. It is claimed that there are dozens of other female stars on the list of 100 other hacked stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how many of the photos are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those who are watching pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are WRONGED, don't you understand."
Let me put an end to this right from the start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images about the star.
Just an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter J
They dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, gradually they came apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had been a relationship in the early stages, but it had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, a northern village that was even more barren and further from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. Aunt had inherited a house located in a humid but paradise-like valley, and the valley was appropriately called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden, resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news when Ailinn's crossed, sun-brown feet brought to Kevern's mind a song that had been sung by a long-forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were too aggressive in principle and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not forbidden —nothing was forbidden — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to be left in oblivion, just like the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion accomplished what was not achieved by laws and exclaiming: just as in literature, people chose heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances to read, in terms of music, they favored ballads.
Excavated by the day, Kevern began to key the imaginary piano and sing serenade to Ailinn's big feet in a brazen comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let go of the word that started with a j and didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't so now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz had not been declared banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word if.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit shown through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that he could not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion here either.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude — grateful, that they were like saved by happiness — the principle that each group did things inherent to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribian ancestry are best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so it was their job to ensure that every family had a working phone used to handle things.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When IT, WHAT HAPPEN, IF THE EVENT came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of blazing the flames and fearing that those flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and burning the water pipe.
Let each one act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and she found it difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern just sung had ever been dressed into music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-legged people think.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was amusing to Dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of view.
Nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow-black hair bush.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say that," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it for me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father had meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made only of plain flowers, so he could not use it as the cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words and for the fear that was seen in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been similar to life here.
The same vast, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and dispersor grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a thick fist again if he wasn't careful!
Imuta first — kissing had become the most common word describing erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote to the insignificant love ballads pumping out of the receiver — suction first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, too, because the suction itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed her going —just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go upstairs —a man who was the cause of his heavy life himself.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt sorry for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who turned his back, bowed, shameful, beaten man, who had lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at a private institution measuring the General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in areas of the country where the decline, or even the end of violence, was most likely given the money and energy spent to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "so that the natural aggression of the nation that has fought for thousands of years and most often overcomes, especially in the abandoned and remote corners where, despite church towers over hedges, human mildness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people weep with sentimental ballads, devour stories of defeated adversity, and swear by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban cohabitations in its relentless grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more ill-souled will to argue in homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her eyes to the ground.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to plead his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality, and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain degree of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, the kind you have just suggested to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church — and what you call cruelty or evil soul, others usually call natural energy and physical intensity.
Saying what happened if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon pink LED light proclaimed a guideline that Ofnow had already shared with the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to YOU, WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not pour out our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "as you describe as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may have done or may not do.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'."
A person in a position like you should not have to remind that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we're completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it any more - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to make them.
But what does the past exist for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose drive was described by passersby as "bad-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning attack; prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied having staged an attack to overthrow the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had besieged his official residence and taken over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him he had received a threat of death.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi banned the attack and said the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics." Police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's defense forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they were ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
According to Clayson Monyela, the spokesman of the South African government, the military's actions seemed like a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be in every way in line with the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to Lesotho army officials, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have occurred in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the Grand Coalition Government.
He thus denies disparaging the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to establish data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft, an information technology company, has established a large data center in Uusimaa in a place whose location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent by Microsoft to media, the company states that it does not state the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been guessed as the place of the centre.
Microsoft will completely close its Oulu office, which will take the job away from about 500 people.
Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company will not comment on how many staff the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data center in Uusimaa was announced on Monday by Kauppalehti.
Man accused of running over girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is accused of running on a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of running on a girl at a intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied charges at Dundee's sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure the camera battery and other parts are sealed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera shooting settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or camera and camcorder combinations have a setting to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for branching, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while photographing in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Try to get close to the subject being photographed.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater, because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire image up to the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing unrest that requires democratic reform.
The decision will likely spark the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business block after activists began to plan and implement protests just hours after the decision was released.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists power to eradicate any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says Democratic Party chairman, legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that the general candidate for the election of Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, with the UK handing over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee, which is managed from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, some of the largest and most striking protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and they would create waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, organizers said that the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance of dialogue has failed and the taking over the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling of many that the inhabitants are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
There is also a fear that Hong Kong values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeline — the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it takes," says legislature Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see the spread of concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
This image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are henchmen of the Western powers that fuel the revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people — more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the region's largest pro-democracy demonstrations.
US prom tradition strikes British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing Britain's first form of luxury travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the customer's most memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart also said there was a security aspect of the service.
Service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the brim.
When combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and high-quality transportation possible to the university.
The company's spokesman said there have not yet been reservations, as the service has just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay tuition fees of £9,000.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's college section, said that "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority."
Many who start their studies this month are shocked by the level of cost of living, as the financial subsidies available in the form of loans and grants have fallen behind the staggering increase in basic living costs. Only next can one begin to think about where to find thousands to use for something as simple as arriving on campus.

Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig is lying in the living room of the house in the picture.
The one-bedroom house, which costs £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.

Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in the ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where the question has been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to faint on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the embodiment of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget his sysi-black US match and overcome the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his stagnant solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, it was blurred, there was nothing he could do.
That noise and white sea was almost too much for me.
The gym's power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball game, disc holes, and tricked wherever it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow state that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now in a very important place," Sasu said.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so it's no wonder his example brought the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous ones remembered a outrageous judge game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 Argentine World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the last Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament like yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the first half.
"In the solution balls of that match, the judge game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shits went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played in command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's champions as the Polish World Cup gets off the ground today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over 32 years.
Players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster than before," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The player material in Finland has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to continue from the first half.
Then it can be tight," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we're petring 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
This weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt her paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little forward, but its feet just didn't carry it," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said there was no help from police, a nearby hotel, or passersby.
As the evening went dark, the situation began to look threatening.
Fortunately, two hikers happened who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway's highest mountain on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message he sent to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon a German man with a camping mattress also happened to arrive.
From the mattress, Cita was given a stretcher like a stretcher, to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, thinking about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
Soini said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in difficult terrain went slowly.
However, after about an hour and a half, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank them once more.
The Soini answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soini were already on their way home.
They had been happy to hear from Mikkelsen: - Cita is feeling better!

Genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. When the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his examination papers saying he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and dying before I turned 25, and in between, I would slowly lose my entire ability to function.
I went through this by myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from some much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT disease is, I thought I had postponed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
100 migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Police said the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to reach Greece, and another 800-900 euros to reach Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, a large number of a couple of million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

Hull hired striker Hernandez club with record amount
Premier League club Hull invested a record amount of the club in the acquisition of Uruguayan national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The deal is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and entered the Italian main league.
He has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games from exchange to the field.

On Monday, Hull also said he had acquired Senegal's national team captain from Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russian space test failed - geckos sent on sex trip killed
The five little geckos sent by Russia to reproduce into space have died, Roscosmos, the Russian Federation space agency, said in a statement.
The Gekos traveled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
Through the effects on geckos, efforts can be made to predict the effects of weightlessness on a person while he is in a state corresponding for longer periods of time, New Statesman illustrated in July.
Roscosmos says the time of death and cause or causes of death of the geckos will be investigated.
According to Interfax, passengers who were crossed as "sex geckos" froze.
It is also surprising that the fruit flies on board the same Foton-M4 survived the journey, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
French authorities announced the matter on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track the man after he had lured a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told authorities that the family has no family in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, according to authorities, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had already followed the man's actions.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalizing young people attracted to wars in Iraq or Syria also pose a security risk to France.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France have travelled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there or are currently planning to leave for Syria.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team's hopes for a further position are in the game when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine is again among the countries from which Finland should take the profits needed for the extension.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning," Petteri Koponen said.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Game Leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but yes we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defenses in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in his defeat for the United States yesterday.
We need to rediscover our own strengths.
I can guarantee you that a normal pack of wolves will be seen on the field," Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged nude photos spread online - some confirmed to be authentic
A number of nude images are spreading on the Internet that are claimed to be performed by well-known public figures.
Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "naku-picture campaign".
The entertainment website TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted.
TMZ says actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy ailment was seen for this.
I sympathize with everyone who was the victim of hacking," he writes.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls images of her own name fake.
Genuine or fake nude images are also on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match well describe the current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But everything must be adapted," Viitala said after the struggle that ended in 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the first half, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not happy with bad defensive play.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, and for that reason defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also received opportunities they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here sometime," Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given many young people playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected immediate success as the players constantly change.
This season has not had the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive head, the crowd has changed.
That's the main reason we're in this place," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS loss, in equal points with the second-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop it now.
We will not really fall out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.

Perspective on wolf howling (kin): How can you explain the increase in fan count?
Today was a great vibe.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 after Finland had played in the European Championship Final against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
Pehkonen didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the 100 Finns who shouted a noise in the otherwise empty hall that drew 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine match of the World Cup?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times that of 100 Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships were a time for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann brought Mötttölä to the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution that many disagreed on.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
In the Athens Games, a total of just over 100 Finns were reportedly present.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, too, but there are fans as well.
And there are a lot of them.
This phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number in between, it is an incomprehensible amount.
Here is some explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit how our girls and boys are doing around the world," says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sports Sociology.
Certainly both in Spain and the World Volleyball Championships in Poland there are Finns looking for an experience.
Common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There must be attraction in sports itself.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports competitions than Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses cannot move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were raised on a pedestal.
Volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the public is also interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen recalls.
Can ball sports shift this massive interest to home series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average for hundreds or just over 1,000 spectators.
Itkonen considers the question good, and may not give an answer that promises very good to species.
The second school believes that interest will shift.
The second is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not two times interested.
It is a challenge for companion people in the midst of the drug.
Bottas plot confirmation - nearly 1.5 hectares by the lake
Nastola awards Formula driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach home plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of the 1.4-acre plot at its meeting on Monday.
A holiday home will be added to the property in the future.
Nattola has been following Bottas' success since his karting times.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition order in the area, of which the municipality will demolish six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas reached his fourth prize ball in the Formula 1 Belgian race this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Vilkale, his childhood.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever there is free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It presents and tests them in the ongoing U.S. Open tennis competition in New York City.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the ball people on the field, but Marcus Giron, an amateur who is one of the top college players, also likes that.
He said the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven in the nylon shirt, from which the information is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and then on to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, rhythm of breathing, stress and steps.
The mokkula, which serves as a central unit, is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not told us the exact time for the shirt to start selling, nor has it even hinted at the price.
Raph Lauren is not the only company to invest in smart clothes.
Athos from California has brought smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 apiece and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $2 hundred.
The technowear was also written by Red Orbit.
Smart Way to Save in Textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who will soon start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students in later courses borrow their books for nominal remuneration rather than selling the books right away.
"My book in mathematics would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, along with a heavy sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder reports that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less for it than the students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc., which runs more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores in the past spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, you can only get a new book in a third of the price it would cost in the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is nearly $290, but the book from the special books online store Chegg.com is available for $239.99.
Buy used
Books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book is available from Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a last-year student at Brigham Young University, says he has purchased the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes reforms of the new edition are not relevant to education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks should be considered if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the fees for using the highlight pen and wear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for access to an e-book to its holder, for example Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store provides "Calculus" as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and engineering can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worth comparing, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdine in Law School, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it allows you to make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price at the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Nearly double the number of people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish Association for Rescue (Spek), 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths at the same time.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses, seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of a review of fire safety in the home.
At least all home smoke detectors should be ensured to work according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
All facilities in the home must also have an unobstructed exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use while alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-peak meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived all the way from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after they were stuck in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales area of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party of local police officers and helpers was sent to find young people, and the two were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple and were raised to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital and were stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
The Ukrainian army said the soldiers were given an order to retreat.
Ukraine says paratroopers have fiercely clashed with Russian tanks on the field.
According to an army spokesman, the gunfire on the other side has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits in the Asova Sea yesterday sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard was not sure where the ship was shot.
Separatists said yesterday on social media that they had shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said that an immediate ceasefire should be reached in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to any new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about our partners' actions," Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains spanked southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under them.
Authorities estimated on Sunday that it may take a while to ease the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains were able to surprise Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was issued in advance for the rains.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on call at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be silent and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" towards a socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said, earning a round of applause.
As a dull gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave alone the controversial 35-hour week of work in France, despite the new finance minister Emmanuel Macron's proposal earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing at a meeting of socialist MPs who expressed differing opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the socialists' constant discord and said he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the former did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and considered the election victory of his party certain in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the list tip in the May European elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Journal du Dimanche on Sundays, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's period in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the audience needs to quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's son was badly betrayed in the recorded part of the program.
Last Thursday, the Good Morning Finland program released a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Good Morning Finnish advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite in a row.
Alm-Sira goes crazy in her words when she tries to pronounce the word budget session, and her craziness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their nerve time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, Good morning's Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the magazine photo agency, finished third in the portrait series in 1972.
The picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in the Construction Masters House in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had over five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
From Meir's face, you can see that Middle Eastern leaders have had a hard time before.
Then the competition was able to cope with pictures of well-known people or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images today, as long as there is an idea and visual torsion.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash picture of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send that to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost over five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost over five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his dissertation on information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system where the data collected to solve the crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence while enabling comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be checked on Saturday.
1999's perception of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish diet includes fish and chicken dishes"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Journey school caused a food bowl on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetarian diets at school lunch include fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old statement that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image, which has spread on social media, has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of food and cleanliness services, says to Yle that the note that the ticket that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in its time.
Each student receives a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are only offered a vegetarian option with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that vegetarian experiments among young people may leave nutrition incomplete and the absence of meat or chicken can arouse wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, from people closely involved.
The acquisition would give Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalization of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources say that information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce any results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names public because negotiations are not held in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to requests for comments and Apollo's representative declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when turnover was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, sails under Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when they choose a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first issue of shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information released, Genting accounted for 28 percent of the company, Apollo's 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP for 8 percent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise when issuing shares.
The Tampere City Board is dealing with the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Board will provide solid support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a dissertation for the University of Tampere, during the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world, it is worth ending quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become more common around the world that the grip of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
I would like to see this view taken to Tampere as well.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, Näsi-delfin's death confirms the demands for the downfall of dolphinarium activities.
Näsi's death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a stop on the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be transferred to a restricted sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the original habitat of dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience even more life than a non-stimulating concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association aims to ban the use of all species of wildlife in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act under preparation.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support the demand, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins today, 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season that will start in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are brutally imprisoned or killed each year, either for dolphinarium use or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations on new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin called on Sunday for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in eastern parts of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state" of the separated region, Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which will allow it to be directed towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with State Channel 1 TV, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to recapture the separatist-controlled Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula itself on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossija", "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of splendor before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said the planned peace talks would be "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians are conducting campaigns for the parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in southeastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" is related to wider independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership as it tries to dispel fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
There can be no discussions on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a conflict within Ukraine".
The interjection of the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime deals with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions differently from Crimea, when it practically took over an area with a majority of the population of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
Moscow would be much more difficult to link even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main fleet of Russia, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historic coastal sites.
The Russian region between Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators — after the new elections — consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions different from the core territory of Ukraine on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of separatists perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest call to the Kiev government for negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the Azov Sea coast.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically significant coastal area as far as Crimea.
It has led to massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Saturday, asking for further action to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the drafting of further sanctions to be introduced if the Ukraine crisis flares up in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored divisions and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
Lysenko said the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk were traded for 10 Russian skydivers who were imprisoned in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese master Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari was hit first and a little later Jeremy Menez from the penalty kick.
Lazio got a penalty after his narrowing goal at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez turned down Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
Milan's former attacker in Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The audience for the match was announced as 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of nude-picture scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged after hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been teeming since a group of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were released on the internet as a result of an extensive celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude images of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars such as top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko, who lives in Melbourne, have also been apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contact and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as "shameful" and said that the victims "feel themselves disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merits include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that "there is a brazen violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in a tweet: "The release of images stolen from the cell is no different from selling a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like it was at home and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Look at the photos of the fan drug.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue-white.
Finland's victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at Spodek Arena, according to the STT.
It felt like playing at home.
Such a big impact the fans had on our game," Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth period, Finland made a miracle rise from six points ago.
Cuba led the round from 16-10, but after that the Finns got the charm on top.
However, a couple hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an on the field, the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the hard fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball fans have conquered Europe at a high pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 Finnish fans present at the World Basketball Championships.
It was as if every basket in Finland was the winning basket of the match, US star Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
