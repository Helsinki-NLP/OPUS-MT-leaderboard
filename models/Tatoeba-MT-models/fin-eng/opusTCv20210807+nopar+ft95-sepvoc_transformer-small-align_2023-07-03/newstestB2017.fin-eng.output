28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco mall
Only a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping mall staircase this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Franciscoan Frank Galicia, reports a San Francisco forensic agency.
San Francisco Police Department says the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he made San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant chef six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family, and we're sorry to be big," the spokesman says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices that happened in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows something about the incident is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hot number 415-575-4444.
Striked junior doctors demand new industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors in Britain (whose mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Doctoral Trade Union (BMA) is asking its entire government for support for further industrial action from early September.
The JDC said the ministers had not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the contract with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter on Twitter Thursday night to JDC members, saying the government "consistently silenced" on issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted down a whole new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government requesting permission for gradual expansion of industrial action since early September."
Due to the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, which included the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, Director of Junior Doctors at BMA, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms of the contract that BMA had recommended.
Malawana told BMA members at pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students participating in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would come into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an outsider alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met Tuesday to shake hands and bring an eight-month word war and economic sanctions to an official conclusion.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides shook hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't see much heat even by his own reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to a report.
I personally did not keep the count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness that exudes Putin showed that the Russian head has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the incident was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara in strict words and accused him of stabbing in the back.
The insult was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has emphatically denied the accusations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held only to give Putin the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a truce for Ankara are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
This number has plummeted by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh with relief as air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," worded an article in the financial magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it believes that the West is responding subdued to the attempted coup.
Not forgetting the old grudge over the snail-paced negotiations on Turkey's EU membership and Putin's interference, Putin, eager to take advantage of cool relations and erode Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own ingrained concern about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit, Russia and Turkey could convey an image that an analyst described as an "external alliance": two countries that feel they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacebuilder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, each president told a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the two countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they can seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full disaster caused by NATO member Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are again even speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the Bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services, in the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally related to the bank's global goals.
The bank had to back off its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations organby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands go to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWests, except for headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and the reason our staff employs because we are now becoming a bank of much more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations organby, and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's president.
"It would have been very sneering three years ago if we had said that we will be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and focus on customer needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Prediction to win at Newmarket and won her 3,000th win
The dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000th win for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice that night to victory on the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races running on a flat track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have previously achieved the same.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition event is not a large, not Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and I feel great humility."
Dettori accepts cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the time, and it is no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical ability is what sets him apart from others.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he wasn't only competing on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but most of all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori ventri vented his achievement in a distinctive way by jumping off his horse's back.
"From flying goals to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a prime example of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs on the way.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 as "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the plane crash and was banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had difficulty starting at first, but he showed admirable firmness of character, showed his doubters, and returned to his best.
And he's not finishing his career for a while yet — Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until at least 50 years old."
Putin dismisses head of government Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly dismissed his chief of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's entrusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Manager of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Persecution graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's Protocol Department and the Government Office, reports the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you have issued are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, shown by Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially in the run-up to parliamentary elections.
Are the kicks the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and to some extent even difficult job for four years.
Now I have been the President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the state security service KGB.
When Putin served as head of the KGB Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russian President Putin after the second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to a third term.
However, the mission went to another person close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced the kicks in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, had issued an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I regret that this happened," he said in a statement.
Information on how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first season, 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the series until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans the show could ever have hoped for."
Season 12 of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been caught on the ground by a cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision on Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
Queensferry transit bridge is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and land bridge of Queensferry's overpass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four parts between the "covers" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 diagonal ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now scheduled to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Cabinet Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry's overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and more than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge section alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means the lid is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major urine column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the top of the road and civil engineering sector.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower column, we then had to close the remaining northern (i.e., the ground) gap.
This was done by pulling a northern land bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive operation and at the same time a high precision operation.
Massive because the land bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And the high precision demands because the tolerances the work team had to follow were very small — just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports three men's miraculous rescue
Three men who were caught in the water from his fishing boat off Anglesey were miraculously saved.
Moelfre RNLI sea rescue station issued an alert on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless passage without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who was driving Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got out, strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, 60 years old, was found exhausted clinging to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who've been caught in the water are still alive and perfectly fine.
The boat's engine had an emergency fire extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had come off from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky on their way."
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, screen time was only taken by watching TV, then video games and most recently smartphones came along.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a cartoon series, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped shortly before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for pokémons on their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When a pokémon is found, it can be "photod" (using the phone screenshot) or "capped".
The fad has caught a generation of video games younger and lifted the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app on the Apple Watch smartwatch, which discovered within two days of the game's launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day rose suddenly from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know which users play Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amounts of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly mobile people have a lower chance of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This is how it achieves three basic health-supporting things — exercise, fresh air, and sun and joy.
During the yacht, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon includes disapproving spoilers of joy.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity, they did not give a reason to start, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and use will decrease in time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which increases the physical activity of people going on the hunt and improves their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's rack gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless on the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Great at everything.
And now finally, the Olympic champion.
An American 19-year-old gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score on 62 February 1998 was clearly better than the silver-placed "Financial Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform on the boom in the final of the multi-match of the women's gymnastics individual competition on Thursday at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and ever fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best ever.
Biles burst into tears as his overall final points became visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and puts him in the same class as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in its kind for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and earned them with such ambitious and punctual programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast of all time."
In Brazil, there was one last race left, primarily between Biles and the burden of himself and the overly high expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.

Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for the farewell of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program — which includes a volt series known as his trump card — is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Adopted by his grandparents as a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a force figure. Boorman found the girl when she was on a daycare trip to the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina took a small lead with two threads, it was like mirage.
The boom and the permanto remained, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He got back to the lead after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points — which was a mere formality — and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white, and blue glittering crop color when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a slight rematch for a race four years ago when he first split third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "grandmother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent jet kisses to the public after his permanto program, thus rising from defeat position to winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old tweeting made earlier in the week now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three serial killers who listened to music in the car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, and the victims sat talking in a car and listening to music when they were shot, a police statement released Thursday said.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on June 12.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped in another car.
Police suspect that the cause of the triple killing was probably not the robbery because the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix Police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four attacks in the past.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in Latin American-populated areas within four months.
"The events have in common that they have occurred in residential areas off homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of television and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are interrelated and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for her injuries, where she later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the trio had often sat in a car listening to music.
Police also issued a statement saying that there was an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple killing, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The investigators found shell casings and recovered a bullet from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: 'Things are getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get away with this.
I'm not gonna get away with this.
I wasn't committed to this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and may never live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing the child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was such a practice at all," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a rollator.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invented sign, which she means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
There may be several different diseases behind microcephaly: hereditary, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zika virus.
There is a great variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it will affect the lives of people with Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, what happens to us,
What will happen to us."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flood over their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of strong heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the National Bureau of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele says Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a press release issued by the Weather Service, more water may enter the area by 76 to 127 mm.
A flood warning was issued in South Alba on Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile region.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are projected to rise to record heights.
According to Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows in Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi State border, had already risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier Friday near Gloster among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other stepson nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water came with a constant pass," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she has never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years he has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three into a large army-style truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that nearly 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil got wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and street flooding, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of television and radio company CBS, that 200 homes were under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County leader Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
The evacuated have been opened with shelters in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses' facilities.
"The last time we experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city board.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, rains continued steady off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, Harrison County Rescue Director.
Lacy reports that a handful of houses under the flood were reported on Thursday, but so far none had been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
Mahaj Brown, 6, who has received multiple bullets in his body, survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents reported on CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents said the boy had several gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting first grade at local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were in stable condition, CBS Philadelphia reports.
The television company said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The venue was full of assault gun-type shells from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that it was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and it is reported that police are going through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old who was the victim of the shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a delusion while she played in front of her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's gymnastics Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team lineup, complemented by Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and surprising and masterful scaffold gymnastics.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday to win gold in the multi-match of the women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are such at the top of the sport, but the same does not seem the same in rack gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Financial Five"), as there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic team of scaffolding gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that scaffold gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts train mainly in private rack gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most scaffold gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operations.
The teaching of rack gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached enthusiasts since they started scaffold gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and better available scaffold gymnastics education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own scaffolding foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for scaffold gymnastics for more than 15,000 city youths (mostly black and Latin American), some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high quality scaffold gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, suppleness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start scaffold gymnastics, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to the pay and working conditions of the dispute by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, who took part in the vote, rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to get the deal under duress and said the British Public Health System (NHS) was "no one's land" and that any additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors move on to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors are still very reserved for the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we need to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to and sometimes even reacting in any way.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt making a promise last month that his doors will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, overturn the implementation of the contract, and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support striking doctors for the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with trade union staff representing British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
NHS employee CEO Daniel Mortimer appealed to junior doctors not to engage in further strikes.
Mortimer says, "Working action achieves very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the limit and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other parties, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of grievances.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, educational costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector — were a sign of the seriousness with workers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A medicine costing around €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving a drug costing around €2.40 a day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anti-absorbulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (NICE), part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, a quarter of whom have a heart attack or have a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can give birth to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the blood clot comes off, it can pass through blood circulation and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Tikagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guideline, published today, recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams, and aspirin is given twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the Center for the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE), says: "Although effective methods of treatment are available to effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in terms of the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Due to the climate that fosters political correctness, voter turnout in Muslim areas flourished
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman resigned last year due to corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The climate of political correctness led to eye closure from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report published today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticized police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to election fraud "due to hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Known as the former Minister of Regional State and the current anti-corruption force figure, Pickles said that intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present ID in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At this time, the voter must only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize fingers into indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He insists that journalists' access to Government documents and decisions of informal boards and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud and a culture that favours them more broadly in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister requested a report after the vote scandal at Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should resign for corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court ruled that Rahman "sneeringly" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and dampened his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use the religious duty of every Muslim of the believer to vote for him as the basis of his campaign."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently given by the person voting by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was obtained throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about postal election fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, especially in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh backgrounds."
"There was concern that... government institutions had closed their eyes to such action because of 'politically correct' oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots to political activists in order to prevent "harvesting votes".
Currently, Theresa May's report under consideration also requires stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present ID before voting.
Baptizing fingers into indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of handling completed votes and postal voice envelopes sent by post to political activists.
Police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act of 1983.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Allowing English only at polling stations (except Wales).
More effective training to ensure staff monitor the rule that only one person may enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and considers it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representatives from their duties due to corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective "trust checks" of the departments responsible for the city council's electoral lists.
"The court's decision last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and denial of it by some parties."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance with Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers are fading at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance with Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the American men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the doppelganger of Duchess Catherine on the cycling tracks, many people have noted in social media how an archer could be the twin brother of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the American men's archery team caused a storm on Twitter after photos of him, in which he is startlingly reminiscent of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted to hearing since he was a child that he resembles DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance as so great myself, except for the beard and the mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm taking this as a compliment."
The 2012 London Games highlighted the resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which is undoubtedly brought to light even more in these races.
The great- and expressive Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the bathing tracks, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for the Glee television series, for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "ataletic version" of the actor in Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Yulia Efimova of Russia, resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and light hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team is, according to his fans, "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance as well.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the couple's resemblance.
One tweeter recently expressed his pleasure when "others on the internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's resemblance."
The American football star and Dexter series actor really startlingly resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Many have also observed resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Return! in the broad smiles of Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message shocked CBC's direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian public broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize since one of its commentators said 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smelling" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left fast, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at 1:57.79, the second part of the message, and was left 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
In the final of the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message, Ai Yanhan, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with furious Byron MacDonald critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macronald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #responsive."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to make apologies on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his regret to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, for these statements and for making it to the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies on the broadcast and tried to justify his speeches by saying he didn't mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment I made last night after the women's messaging," MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn't mean anything degrading by my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, she unblocked underwear in the middle of the store shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit underwear.
He further made the situation worse by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, took them off his leg, and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain shop at Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping centre, where she tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the same time in the store, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says, "People couldn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it with complete shame.
Everyone stared when he took his underpants off and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it again three more times before finally deciding he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about looks — and he didn't think of the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues, "How disgusting to think that someone is taking their underwear to their home that someone else has worn and has not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff tried to remove those items from sale after the woman left — which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without being washed after that," adds Davidson.
A Primark spokesperson commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been removed from sale."
How to defend yourself against armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York City, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun in close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to turn around is to see the attacker and get off the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it is between your forearm and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with his knee into the groin, and when he goes double in pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and retreat by holding the gun at him.
The technique is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches the front. You must move away from the shooting line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of the robber is by handing over your cash — unless you are the Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright, a world traveler who makes travel guide, licks some of Europe's dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and kakomis reflex to a severe test by licking the dirtiest and most repulsive places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk host and travel guide writer, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking a euro banknote, handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the targets with a luminometer to see for himself and show viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright — On the trail of inner power, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the train toilet flush button can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to various parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals for strengthening good bacteria in the intestines and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad-tasting mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of railway station handrails and toilet flush button undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid and put all kinds of things in my mouth, like dirt, worms, and mud water."
In the film, he really showed himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was only met in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came up in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when a luminometer measured 4,000 units as the result — in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright, along with Valio, adventures in the documentary Ian Wright — On the trail of inner power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in a variety of places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4,000 units, nothing is dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright on the trail of inner power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus, a lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps strengthen good intestinal bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager of snack, juice and novelty products at Valio, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we ended up with the idea of asking Ian to come along."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a broader context instead of just talking about products and telling us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "Let's say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows shot on tape."
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria, especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they used products with added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Before their eviction, a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, destroyed the disturbance family
The troublemaker family left behind the $50,000 damage to the town-owned tenant house after they were evicted due to the terrorization of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from her apartment in Cornwall's Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company stated that the apartment was in good condition for renovation.
There were gaping openings in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been applied to the floors, and the walls were smeared with graffiti.
The couple has now moved and are believed to live in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Housing), says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to weigh, as the property will likely become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and police say the family's tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of close residents, drug use and caring, and loud shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, who signed the lease, was given an order on antisocial behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the house under the threat of demolition.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to call regularly.
Cornwall Housing Agency evicted the couple by coercive means this week after giving them 11 weeks extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which police were regularly called in.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency will consider.
This incident was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and boldly offered to give us information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean up the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and additional scales and other supplies, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall Police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave the way they want without charges, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-dipped army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane crashed staggeringly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes almost within touch of tourists sunbathing on the sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got on their feet, understandably worrying about the thunder of jet engines, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who shot a dramatic fly by and videos of vacationers posted on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro experienced shock when the plane suddenly became visible and flew staggeringly low.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which required the aircraft to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke from nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of continental Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility of heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote's first half-year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made 3.4 million euros better than planned in January - June.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the sequences of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The portion left over it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers Taken a Military Whale in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in by a military oath on Friday.
The military oath of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The whale event for the tenth special border ice cream course was held in the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special border lichens are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the jury included five wartime border troops veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A pie ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The unit's operation is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is pulled by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief supervisor is Lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian uniforms.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of the police's working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less often not leave the straws until they receive an alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily policing where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, leads the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have computer skills better than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, alarm mission database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in the work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the author forms a certain kind of image.
Speculation can be done either on the basis of the method of action or on the basis of the person, depending on which the police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit employees do not run the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both themselves and criminals are not reported, as it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police will publicly report the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, such a case was the method of marking empty dwellings reported in early summer, used in housing burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment, with which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the district court minutes, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to thieves with gloves on.
Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
The background is a decrease in the number of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that ended in 2013 until the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of one's own institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
News reports that one of three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will so that people will understand this is a real risk when going to the war zone - and that causes people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had been widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
Senate Republican representatives have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would elect the person who is to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton would choose Garland with "quite great certainty."
Reid's spokesperson later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "took the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals in Columbia County.
Reid says Republicans who are blocking Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commanders" and "pre-helpers."
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong as well to women as men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a calendar made in the style of the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazines, as he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same of the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images praising the female body without bothering them," said Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who wish to join the calendar can send their photos online or attend open selection sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection to the comment section under the pseudonym EväAllLonely Middle-agedMen, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov research, behind the new coming of much-spoken vinyl records is not a millennial generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is middle age nostalgia behind it.
The age of the person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
Those in age group 18-24 are actually the least likely buyers.
It is also not just a matter of hobbyists' desire to collect records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions hidden (56% v. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked down the lively Soho Street, wearing a unscrupulous grey jacket. I would live up livelyly, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a while as I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and character by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, followed by the Sister Ray movement (as clients, two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (as customers, currently eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time exploring the store offerings.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent a picture to me via email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they originally appeared, and rebuy things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of things in the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has observed a new kind of flow of people affected by media hype, who have heard of vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"From the discussions I had had, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyl," he says.
This can explain the boom of vinyl awakenings of certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they offer a comforting community to like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly upset about the contact-free payment system.
The digital world may thrill some vinyl fans for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and reminding you of the lucky days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or material property is acquired for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I feel it as a collector myself, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" swung Wez's co-worker behind the pile of records.
A April ICM opinion study revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The poll also reported that 41% have a turntable that they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers do not have their own turntable at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while browsing stacked bossa nova collections.
The re-emergence of vinyl records is also accompanied by the "pocal phenomenon", which has been observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe movement (as customers, currently three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he didn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers tell us they don't have a turntable yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fop, where I will arrive next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
Customers include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous stores: instead of rocking jazz from the speakers, Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer popping out of sex.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various records on sale.
He's watching rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine top is ...," he lets a fond sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a group of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jeans shorts, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some are so high that they can't even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money in the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that is most likely to have more time and money than most people is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
Although my research suggests that YouGov's results are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or in the workplace.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings hanging out at Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a television host who stares frighteningly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is the ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged 272-512 years in the study, a five-metre-long female.
French court rejects application to demolish jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected an application from Calais authorities calling for the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities made allegations that the state should be allowed to break up 72 temporary shops set up in a refugee camp. The stores sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks for residents of the refugee camp and provide haircuts. Tea can be purchased at temporary restaurants for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais Prefect Authorities, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other entities are not enough for the camp's ever-growing population.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling 72 temporary traders, but found Calais' prefect's concerns "fully understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids café of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours, and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring the children's café to be preserved.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that since the sharp increase in summer arrival numbers, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record, over 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food is sharply cheaper in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
Of the comparison countries, only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are shown in an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to 1994 prices.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed by the bans on food imports imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average in EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes with VAT rates are indicative.
School is no longer exactly the same.
A person returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, learning fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is being practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already being read in four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lasting vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks, Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It may live another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic clam, the oldest known individual of which is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres tall.
Because the growth rate is slow, monitoring shows that only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493 and 502 centimeter Amazon fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired to nearly 300 sellers not cut
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The cooperation companies in a company that ran into difficulty ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction in approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It says that the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of support functions are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At their start, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realized next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company's goals.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was driven especially by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter revenue and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the corresponding time, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will contract from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on top of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but further south are pout.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
The rainy areas of the north remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
Doping officials came in to Anzrah's authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner has any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is a favourite of Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was on an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch athletics.
On Friday, the struggle for athletic medals was started in Rio, but the world's top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day morning games and 65% of the evening games have been sold.
The second one was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulging from the cheering people.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The lookout of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, the stands were only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30% of the 12,000 stands were filled.
The bad thing is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organizers, said 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost nearly half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem bearer rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire the right of holder for a fee.
The holder will be vetoed in its 187 square meter block, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be obtained for more blocks.
The acquisition of the right to control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information from their block, which allows, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website shows the name information of those who have acquired the holder rights on the same map where the area block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the worst from large cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst tormenting Turku from the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in nine other largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated on the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts of them per 1,000 inhabitants has been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, double the number of thefts occur relative to the population," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the Police Board.
The police in Turku wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much you move around the city on wheels and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely depending on what the study and cycling cities are.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police become aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts annually.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're in large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are clear.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Events are also clear in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly for the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja are the most stolen from individual wheel models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up on sale, for example via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not been reported to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad much," Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be careful, as he may commit a concealment crime or offense.
"Alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries its colourful Nopsa every day to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, Moose says. "Never taken, there has been a good monk in that regard."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be hipster value here either," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike snooped against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"I'm going to think about it a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned," a Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you hear from the guys that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, those kind of rag Jopos."
A bike was stolen from the courtyard of the housing company a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, though, so Valve could expect it to be usurped.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try peer-to-peer jury familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer-to-peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by the young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury discuss what happened with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter written to a family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"Everything guides the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that not everything gets ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modeled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel but reflects on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio, service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of people under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you'll continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
The open letter was directed at Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the US economy will go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a handhold for American workmen who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the withholding tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president] I am against any trade deal that works against employees or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced Monday by Republican Donald Trump for "favoring only millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed heavy reduction in corporate taxes has previously called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products in America himself," Clinton said.
Such are Rio ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators so far.
At one time, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over one million.
So far, the Olympic sports have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached nearly half a million spectators for the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that spectators are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are spectators from 20,000 to 500,000 all that time, that's a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large number of Rio race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the lame interest - if someone considers it lame - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the network ratings until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other minor technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are visible in Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristisselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology dive trainer Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square metres in Ristiselkä, the bottom of which the dive computer looked 104 metres deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
When viewed in this way, Päijänne cannot reach the 10 deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: The last piece repaired, where the deepest lakes in average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax sale: Taxation of pensioners still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came up in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter heated up opposition representatives in Parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) of election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo for their desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been easily achieved.
He says that sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It is done by labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It will be needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment to be seized in the threshing
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of increasing the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, in the past, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will probably affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in a tourist destination popular with Finns, a holiday island in Phuket at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current reports say they did not claim any deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the military junta who controls Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' purpose has been to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the guidelines of the crowd about caution, Westphalen says.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks that have taken place during the Finnish night and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a sight.
Thai PBS says police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for rack championships at the Rio Games on a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been mastering women's gymnastics as much as they like for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-way and permanno championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has won two world championships in the team competition.
The fainter World Cup medals Biles have a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, then hardly this one either.
The office of Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard of the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the main street shops were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At 3:30 a.m., Thai time in Patong had normalized traffic and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who has visited the site of the attack.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russia's Leader on Changes: Clear Depreting
Russia made the highest-ranking leadership change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gone into trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was made to a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Persecution to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the height of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old curves, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to younger.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shields when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and that the data had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the title Games.
He injured his hind thighs in the early part of the season and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Around Poria Bolt, it underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the initial 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career measuring the cap with a clock.
World records in Berlin at 9.58 100 metres and 19.19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
In 100, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens's 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost any time in the finals of the title Games during his reign in Beijing if he has only made the journey.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to a fraud start.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the last finish line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: two athletes suspected of doping violation
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio home due to a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio in 200 metres.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the confusion before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be a thriller and maybe startling, but he insists he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers do the job and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grinned.
You know what?
It is a stir from nothing if it comes from (the host's) dress.
I'm a little amused if one of these has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests over suspicion of terror
Rio police announced Thursday that it had arrested two people due to suspected terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with the security oversight of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed on the popular WhatsApp service, among other things.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament games in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police let the audience in after controllingly blowing up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was able to enter after police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only let the public into the hall after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
Spain, which started the two losses, won Nigeria with a score of 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain reached silver.
Police performed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious finding was near the road cycling finish site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their first round of Rio basketball games in front of empty stands.
Argentine lady poke Petäjä-Siren - Finnish pondered protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren was going through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He was stuck due to the crash, and others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete long considered protest.
It was not worth doing so, because it would have been pointless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left in 27th place with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
The crash with the tip had little effect.
Friday is an important day when you are raced 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says prolongs age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring him or her additional years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to spend money - just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to discover the secret of long life through a variety of studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Another study that suggests that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived to be older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway investigated how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in their life, they also need to have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings more years, there is no denying it.
However, achieving a long life does not require absolute pass.
A study at Oxford University found that women with big butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it is an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor at the Olympics, he is more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for their part, allows for recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be pursued.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 found that a person shopping daily, probably less likely to be older than a shopper.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring death forward.
So put the credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from umpihuma derailed into a truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car bar crash took place in Koskel, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred on Koske, mid-Friend of Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that met had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into a ditch and then across the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Postman sends loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We can get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there is no traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The shopkeeper's foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is available for Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention this issue has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her own favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few laurels were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages were misled yesterday in the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went out to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not indignant at the sign because she found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.
Dizzi losing weight! 30 pounds lightened Lotta Backlund posted a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slimened dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed at normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has gradually lost about thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos on Instagram for his soaring performance.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has collected several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, though.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel on the same journey," the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then ten pounds away.
During the three-month fitness course, five pounds eventually dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered by a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed their nurse training there.
The veterinary station recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and fearless of work.
Good Friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked by police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a conviction for violations of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, Kanta-Häme District Court estimates in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and 2,000 euros in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor's salary, which corresponded to the share of induction throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU's decision on the introduction ban.
During the November post strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarize themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalists' Union asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns about Turkey's freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin dismisses head of his regime - replaced by Persecution of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin says.
The grandson of Karl Vaino, Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, is moving to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to a Kremlin statement.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not seen at Premier League opening
The world record man for football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid 105 million euros from Pogba to Italian club Juventus, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniac madness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves like to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think so.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
A week before the event, he knew that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of 70,000 people last year by 5,000 people.
The festival will also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because something needs to be funded.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated so that the area, partly decorated with artificial turf, has 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, the venue this year will be a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Kallio is that even large visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "cruise things" such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but the festival, which combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, is not the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it is probably the last time he will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up while tourists began to leave their bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a eloquent picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, a second double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang city.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organizations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to take combat missions until several months after taking a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable in a war situation.
According to the Head of Education, the reservists belonging to the rescue force are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used for military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for home house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in order of demolition in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as 198,000 euros.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District and Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court's judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of 150,000 euros.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of 47,344 euros in legal and settlement costs for the couple.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the dwelling had already been known to buyers when the housing transaction was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the resulting building errors were substantially more serious than had been suggested.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the condition inspection report do not harm.
The fitness check report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that there was any urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma remained in the impression that rainwater from the cliff should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections conducted in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which Witnesses say were due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air could also be accessed indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows for health risk, exceeding the limits was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of information received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also registered Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter about how the National Archives in Maryland, USA, have a total of 218,500 women stored on microfilms, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency was under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who were to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the matter.
The Race Agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations to the Race Agency from loved ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the website of the United States Holocaust Museum says.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The German mother's cross of honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first departure of Finnjolls Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was the top of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
The Irish rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at RS:X-class day departures in places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Fairytale Castle was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hung up"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite artist for Finns for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and Sillanpää, who has been the star of dance stages and festivals, can still be a snooze and he is currently in a wild lift.
Jari Sillanpää - The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career for good or for bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to total takeoff as he won the tango king's crown at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The storylinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
From recording a piece that became a huge hit, you would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfect and top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence about the most popular songs of the man, which the book tells us about, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner and the case eventually ended up in the texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song words ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but was written on the basis of 7 days news.
In the newspaper's news, the reason for the divorce between Jari and ex-lover was reported to be Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and was not true.
Jari called the record label furiously, according to the book, and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good for that.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the gap and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls for voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions almost unanimously supported staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase "It's the economy, stupid" of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, flew into a piece of junk in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly smittened by the BBC's equity, which gave as much room to economists representing only a couple of percent economists representing the EU's withdrawal as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations are in view of the consequences of the breakup.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not think have common interests.
Academics of big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant is congesting your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center waiting room can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get out of school if they were rid of?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the pro-EU camp, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large-scale liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily listed real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp in favour of leaving the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimates that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, these robbed the situation and put the matter in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation due to the cash collected, but it too had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not really close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, as it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
It was quite steady since then, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental Europe funds, for example.
However, there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate fund trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
Open funds affected by closures control about 4% of British real estate.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties in 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn downwards, but the situation does not look "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% cut in the market compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down to London real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look very good yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of real estate investment at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
There's a word of strength in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B now," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens normally set silent at the office shunned the news, and usually loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell of his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, Vanhanen says.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, or Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was in a way calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK, and especially London real estate market.
London office space was expected to down to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the bully has subsided, but uncertainty is still rife in the air.
It is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is far too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First data have already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The data of CBRE, a real estate service company, on price developments, cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all London properties fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus was 6.1%, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, even because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen does not think that the comparison is quite apt, as this is a home-woven crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also found normally.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is no wonder to him - one could have been ahead without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world's number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have been rising for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, with the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to become globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have become new players in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, decentralize
In London, price increases leveled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's coming.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any surge to come.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more shops up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get out of the pits by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping data in more detail than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group said today it would start collecting more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once data has been collected on the total receipt so far, the group will also start collecting it from purchased products in early May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousanomat.
He said Kesko would not react to S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers to ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, for example, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planned for now.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own First Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or product product products, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like K Group or S Group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, basic data have also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method are stored from the S-Front Card Purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
As of the beginning of May, product level purchase data will begin to be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
Customers have been hoping for a long time that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in the bag anyway, whether you like it or not.
The wish can check their stored data on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black Labrador Retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite toy.
From the box Heila sat next to, a jar of gunpowder gas was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and online store main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Customs Senior Inspector.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs' duties is postal items passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made approximately 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail items.
In ports, it will be a big benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include brisking and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from the one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila immediately returns a soft toy cover from the "loose" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on top of the work vests, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60,000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active workloads only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition in Customs for the owner of working dogs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for Heila's owner.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Fiji Olympic gold in rugby, with a population of less than one million people, is valued so high that the government has set August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded from 175 pounds in his last attempt after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening quality for the lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of pushing in Rio and 145 pounds for the rapture.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get 175 pounds in his last, as did the other.
On the third attempt, the weights rose, accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian nod Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a contract to the end of the season with Estonian nod Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team with power and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good option," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemes meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who is familiar with the kind Alex Dunphy of the modern Family comedy series, is back on showing off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to be much bolder.
The star has posed in pictures she published on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, which is on the eve of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of himself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show up, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more there seems to be a bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years when the downhill is already so hard," says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge you to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, annealing young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their northern lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in autumn and continues into the long spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a fairytale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 race when Fiji's champion team won gold
The UK's impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was devastatingly broken when Fiji won it in the finals played at Deodoro Stadium in Rio on Thursday by 43 to 8.
Fiji taught the masters' teaching in ball processing, moves, side-conceptions, support game, running lines and brutal power, thus winning gold — if there was the first Olympic medal in all its history for the country.
The loss meant silver, a slightly larger comfort for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first-time rugby-7 tournament as an Olympic sport, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win from the South African Boxes in the 7 to 5 semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
It may be comforted to the UK that at least one British will receive a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite a bit for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's coaching in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss hurts, but the progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and presented his tackle skills to the UK for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had crashed into a group of moving buses, and the world champions took the 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a crash into the corner.
After four minutes on the watch, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation was 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's magnificent tackle prevented the rocky Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow down Fiji for long.
After seven minutes of playing the game, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, after which the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal of the follow-up start, with more than one minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the British team's even more powerless tackles and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians are born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentice.
Which is largely true.
The UK made large-scale changes at halftime and managed to hold back the Fijians for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team game of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow down to 36-8 by scoring a goal for the UK at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the Southern Sea archipelagoers, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's pure joyous attitude was hard not to admire.
Mata Viliame scored the final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring at the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, perfectly crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won 20 to 5 in the Japanese semi-finals and the UK had fallen past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the paint posts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, a 15-player rugby team player in England, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This could not be more emotional than gold in these games.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed in history with 220 winning bets and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were the two of them, the boat was third with the voice of Coach Robin Williams, which encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's duo, making them the first women in British sports history to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was already 39th consecutive for them and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water surface like swans to age does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold are a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see today at the time.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And it would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season of the sport in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say so under circumstances like this.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two had thoughts in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in trying to overcome their own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan, says, "At the emotional level I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cashier have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any races in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the two of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very attached in an instant.
Helen kept saying "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get off the route."
"We were very successful leaving, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't reach for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to change government with Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were called for by protesters outraged by Panama data leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential election was clearly visible to those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would also be involved in the founding of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-favored cover burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who has no good manner and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandly expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Blue-green algae opacity in Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality standards set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae opacity has been observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits set in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococcal concentrations in the water on Meriniemi bathing area were secured on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae cement observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, creating blue-green algae mass as boards on the water surface.
Environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, the matter will also be announced separately on the beach's bulletin board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: Over 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism of the tax change proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed for the forest owner's clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the wood sales income.
The VM proposal starts from making a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry to prevent it from becoming a loss of capital income in forestry that would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit for tax deduction tied to the forest's return value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It is drawn too high in Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, it will cut 82% of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing space size.
In forest policy, the forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail surprised motorists on Himanga - two cars derailed into ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rear-end drive on the Himanga in Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove sequentially derailed into a ditch, after which the person in the back collided ahead of the run.
According to the on-call fire master Harri Pyyhtiä, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the car that drove behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car, which drove ahead, was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers towards the Kalajoki River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in the treatment.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues at court, prosecutor also demands murder sentence for second perpetrator
The threshing of the Muhos family home killing continues at court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
One received 8 years 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of aggravated endangering road safety as a young person and for transporting a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be convicted of murder committed as a young person in a 12-year prison sentence.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as director of the child welfare unit in a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind, according to the conviction.
The director had gotten off the grip and led the young person into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled under leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had been planning to escape the family home from at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lasting vertebrate, does not increase until the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world is the confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the ice shark, or holker, swimming around Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not increase until the age of 156.
The ice shark's lifespan is increased by only a centimeter a year.
Only a species of clams is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
Based on them, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throw one way or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change to corporate tax advocated by Donald Trump is carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A truly staggering amount would not be collected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount, 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and the bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on hasty must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump said the "saved" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be waived.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
The Wave of Attacks from the Past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronski-side satirical comedy, the preceding Skin I Live (2011) at the Tops of a Spanish Master's career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modeled for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before her daughter was born, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will rise to the second female lead from the series Time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that time with a one-time and literally one-time swipe.
Almodóvar films often have such a distinctive flashiness, up to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is an evenly played, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite sad, with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there and in such a way that it begins to slowly wink into the eye more as a pure form than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is specific in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the scene in question, do not improve in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, Nobel Prize laureate in 2013.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly evenly thick literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably to more robust drama, so many big things - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres at 12 August.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are made with a lot of cuts.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) are convinced under a budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so hard that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallupit report that the Government Party is facing a blob defeat for the Finns Party, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realize the price of influencing right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of three governments of about equal parties depends on the cant of the Finns Party to endure.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
First, the new cuts will be used to obscure the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, to soften the blow that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of reversing debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take out €5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise its hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts on top of the former ones in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring, what is to be received in the parliamentary elections.
These measures did not match the debt
It is quite clear that with current actions, debt is not possible, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to foment a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget information ceremony prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no attraction to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except during the stimulus policy temporarily pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, maintaining unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on entirely new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organisation of children's day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also devote responsibility to an individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The county, on the other hand, is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night around half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man ran away from driving the police away from fair speeding.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where further to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-legged police officer ran to the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch on Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curved bend to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue services lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil poured into the road from the fallen truck, which was absorbed into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in Ilmajoki this afternoon
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtinkylä, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are searching for a woman about 165 centimeters tall, slim and well-groomed with white hair that extends under the jaw.
Observations and clues about the movements of the missing person are asked to call the tip number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge flow that knocked down the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepper, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially available, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of Friday night at the market.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The surge flow is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the water state of the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the ground is accelerating.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several dive currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of crash flows is difficult to predict.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents in total.
In the accident, four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
The study found that the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Cación analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, die nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A study by Cac found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with various masks, but a more practical solution is recommended regular skin cleansing.
Tractor brakes failed, pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain any further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, leaves for a series that starts in October from better starting points than in memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common note is certainly better found than in previous periods when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säisäis, who continues as head coach of Rienno, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, middle defenseman of the foreign trio, begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played on Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is already underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I worked in the market and playing with women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was setting up a floorball national team.
I am interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM-level as floorball.
The sähly was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM series with the university for the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josba of Joensuu-based floorball club Josba was raised by Perttu Puska and Enolainen-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25, who is attacking Helsinki, has played six men's national matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
Tatu Väänänen, 32-year-old defender of Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, has recovered from the thigh problem and is part of the national team's standard fleet with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player for Seinäjoki's Gaming Brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontolalahti is the head coach of the Finnish Floorball team.
Beach volley master Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after this season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Finals organised by Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs in each series are eligible.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been among the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the nesting stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu tunneled.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in Elimäki's YMCA E-girls.
On top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning in the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice for the counterweight of indoor volleyball during junior years.
A beat has been played at the Kärälampi beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour races thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki this weekend in SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we still lack the prize cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
The weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last audience familiar to Hasu.
In early September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The flip-flops are nailed at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The crash flow knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for people with disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
The fire master Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were the ingredients for a major accident in the situation.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future even in rural areas.
Almost two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I really boldly joined the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is still going to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition for Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen to above zero after October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation rate measured by CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation rates since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared to December 2015%) have been -0.2%, with annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 at -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the prices of the following consumer goods groups were observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's anime effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it is racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that converge with absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog, or character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unvarnished, feature-distorting tools to create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it provided some of its users this week with a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted teeth, and made the cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("Yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts suggest a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday, including online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said they had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some fiercely denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the paralleling of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be fighting an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience is made up of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things are no longer very easily overlooked, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published in Medium, he said he believed that ethnicity conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and male leadership and finished his writing with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either the case that there are no colored people on their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions like this, or they also have colored ones as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK."
Congressional expert team said military officials distorted intelligence about ISIS
A Congressional team of experts released a report on Thursday that officials from the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground suggested.
Republican presidents of the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defense Finance set up a task force whose interim report reports the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by Centcom's senior executives generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the field showed, and were invariably more positive than those in other units of the intelligence community," a press release on the report said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable — our soldiers are suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level policymakers," said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"Centcom management errors extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports ordered by Obama administration officials have been falsified, it gives analysts an image that gives the impression that Centcom leaders pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," the report said.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military assault to recapture Mosul could happen as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
Republicans set up a task force to learn of the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, is followed by more detailed results, as the investigation continues.
In addition, the Secretary General of the Department of Defense has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic representative of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "insulted the morale of analysts," and "considered insufficiently divergent views."
However, Schiff and Democrats said there was no evidence that the White House tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to "predestined or political official lines."
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday on the preliminary results of a Congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, which was initiated as a result of actions filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other aftermath in addition to its efforts to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an argument made by more and more defence authorities).
However, the claims made last year called into question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and to give honest estimates of a military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence about ISIS is in line with the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that President George W. Bush's government, despite protests from many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
According to authorities, last year Hooker's working group concluded that despite opposing public statements, air strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not forwarded outside the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as commander of the Central Command.
US wins fourth duel in women's field hockey and establishes itself in showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning game that ended 6-1 against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States beat India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of the people who keep track of the goals they make."
However, this he knows: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share first place in their group with Britain, which continued their winning streak when winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which determines which of them will be the first of the six teams and which one will be the second.
The first-ranking person avoids a longer encounter with a hard-held Dutch team that won the second group.
No matter what happens in Saturday's game, Americans have already raised a stir for their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up at Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and did not grab a field hockey bat for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel). He made it to the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not make it to the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 Games, where he and his team had little success.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've made a turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball near with a knuckle punch in.
India had entered the game without any tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, squirmed into the midfield, hit the ball to the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, one hit had sunk in each of the American goals.
Briggs is now living in his successful season,
as well as Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of Olympiahulina, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics inevitably come across.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton that moves from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the line of the cafe without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time of the Olympics Dooley charms with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in good-mind TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not equally illuminate all competitions.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are less well-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never made it to the medals and did not advance to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and Canadians have been caught in the medal on the women's side.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, trampoline has the charm of the underdog, partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I acknowledge in this context that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoon films in endlessly continuous bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jumping, that is, species that combine essentially in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "popboard".
Ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that hurles them to an altitude of almost 10 meters. Before landing, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medal lines must get further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal they are aiming for in televised reports, namely the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just when watching the games.
This trampoline offers a respite.
In trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and easily sinks back up.
Of course, the sport also includes a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a heated rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympic Games can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1:00 p.m. local time and men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 2 p.m. local time on each day.
In the middle of Olympiamania, there is a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering appealing male athletes and objectifying them — as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — in that case Logan Dooley is only expecting his panting new fan base.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly disbanded protests requiring political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western ally with a rapidly growing economy.
However, over the past few months, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations, which are spreading to ever wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights organizations said the government's reaction was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos, presumably shot at the end of last year or early this year, show how security forces beat young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and it is all the more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Horn Project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially Somalia, and few African countries, if any, receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia is still far from a model country for democracy, with human rights organisations constantly reporting on the government's repressive policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt out," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in Central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth is demonstrating.
An entire generation protested."
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, from land to the strangulation grip of the government coalition.
After last year's widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the entire parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are increasing at the Eritrean border, where the escalation situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and arm themselves again.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that has been smoldering beneath the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only for the past couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access the internet through proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest population groups, the Oromos and the Amharos.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oromos, much of which are Muslim and live in lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and nevertheless controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled the opposites.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes for almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no trust in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced similar riots was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections that the government first screwed up and then stole, according to analysts.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though there were fewer dead than in the months before, and unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented the intensifying.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the Amhara town of Gondar, protesters attacked Tigre-owned companies, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft that observed neighbouring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires a tight balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried Friday to withdraw his words in the latest dispute that faced his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton several times this week to be the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican side of the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of their country.
His supporters are also in a awkward situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election event Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump completely turned his speech on the tweet from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The most recent review storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls back his words if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters, and he'll see how supporters react to messages, and then 'clear' in one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they are round enough to pass through different screens."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more pungent in recent days as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist, released on Friday, said Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida is in a tight even situation.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being increasingly watched in the last months of their presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they are publicly forced to defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a legitimate, political speech," replied Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called the 'lower league team' and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it did not deal with determination in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of sticking his speeches and a discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he said they couldn't succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and said it just shows more clearly that he was not suitable for president.
Due to excessive rent rise, the café that stopped opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a sleazy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and had no Wi-Fi, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside place on Bedford Avenue when the rent became excessive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals find this loss of a coffee shop that has been forced to dodge from under middle classization.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there is no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, a new one is also created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unshakable.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
bacon-chicken-cheese sandwichs are available and capers and browned onion rings are available for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the cafe, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of keeping the coffee shop, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers started going to the Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made walks to the Verb still in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verbi's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and invariably ordered the same.
"I walked into the cafe every day for over seven minutes, like a machine, and there they already made my butterbagelia with all the toppings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard products, but from time to time he varies from time to time with his bagel's bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop taking the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verbi's own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place for it so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-immered coffee in a café.
The café may also expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of a cafe."
The Dreak Food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the culinary cross, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie gra pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: devil's eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new collaboration is A Square Meal, published by Harper and released on Tuesday, depicting the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the major stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was well suited for the debate on eating the Great Depression.
"The crumbs were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanutloaf, liverloaf and beanme.
They were made from substances that were cheap and abundant.
Imagine eating enough peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grin.
"It must have pressed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression Years, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women cooked for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a key and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new inexpensive diet: According to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as cereal and stews became the main food, and stew dishes were called a "great way to take advantage of leftovers" because chefs could cover up not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the central part of an American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, where the most important thing was the fulfilment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book that also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced oven onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage-time dish.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion are not compatible at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was the head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget makers and to meet the challenge of making nonsense like carrot-creampagets tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowan farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and the sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-covered dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't encouraged him to set an example on her stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the food served at the White House was not only Washington's most boring, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the food during the recession was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food supply and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple says they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once for wind hats."
After the main course plates were emptied at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they made at home, the same one that President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
We reluctantly embedded our spoons in thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe sang a second time and a third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead full compensation for attorney fees for patent dispute for hepatitis C drug with Merck
A judge of the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the attorneys' fees it incurred in a patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was released in June for $200 million in damages imposed on it for violating two Merck-owned patents in connection with successful drugs called Sovaldi and Harvoni Gilead. A U.S. judge found Merck committed violations including perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action recorded on Thursday, U.S. Regional Court Justice Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to exemption from the attorneys' fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
US-backed forces have taken Manbij city from ISIS
US-backed forces have taken over the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist fighters left the city, a spokesman for the troops said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) faction is now raving the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
A spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, Sharfan Darwish, a member of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now entirely in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that her and her husband's income was $10.75 million at the time and the actual federal tax rate they paid was $34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Secretary of State, announced that she had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on his tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a model for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to release his tax records.
According to the custom, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to a tax government audit and call it the reason why Trump has not released his income records.
"The move is yours" tweeted Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Trump's special legal counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax records until the checks are complete.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and released a video online on Friday, bringing out prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in her speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, rather than public tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway multi-purpose company headquarters is located in the same place, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says he too has been audited by the IRS and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili powdered firecracker condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements — elephants are being harassed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The resort has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign with Nature Conservancy in the United States to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to fumble elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as now villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed by pointing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this does not work, a so-called chili cloud is thrown.
The dirt-mixed chili powder is placed in a condom together with the firecracker, after which the condom's head is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine chill of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a throw that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and creates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab 'call' - RT News
A French film director, a Jewish-rooted film director gave rise to media rage after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention the Israeli area code in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed — as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation for the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the procedure shocked the film director even further.
Lanzmann said the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of the Israeli area code."
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the incident was "a great disgrace".
"The case shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and it is this very hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Shame" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called what happened a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement agencies tried to break up a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans.
Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin has made a proposal for austerity measure, which will close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who was in charge of the presidency.
The student demonstration took place just days after the streets were filled with protesters supporting disfellowshipped President Dilma Rousseff, with the country's Senate voting on impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the sanctions were lifted, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says Levan Dzhagaryan, Russia's ambassador to Iran.
He said Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further growth in trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between the two countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The deal was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, Russia's foreign mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries in terms of tourist numbers to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it's not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scottish Callum Skinner to finish as British win cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner rose to fame in the men's team sprint at Rio's velodrome last night when the British trio defended the 2012 championship in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow was in the role of anchor, which he inherited from his compatriots Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud to thank the finish line and grab the victory from the New Zealand team, which was considered a favourite of the win.
Britain won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was a man that British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in qualifying, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny put forth the team's leadership, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace at a larger gear, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy followed from his position as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' gaze as they entered the podium.
Skinner, 23-year-old in Glasgow, says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he deliberately fell on the track due to a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the British rivals had no means of appeal.
This time, there were no problems of this kind with sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The atmosphere was like in London, all the flags of Great Britain were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that winning at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, a successful five days of velodrome are ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympic Games.
This would mean increasing the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (on the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint that starts today and will be resolved in three days.
28-year-old Kenny from Bolton says, "At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You'll enjoy winning with friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team guarantee.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 10:42 p.m.) will be competed today on the second day of the race, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competition officials before the time trial when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now be confident that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After a truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas behind them, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night at the velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of Great Britain to rise to the top at the perfect moment is once again realized.
The future of Portland smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminum smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers, are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelter told that one of the plant owners is dismantling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to continue the subsidies to keep the factory in operation.
Fixed support for 20 years will cease in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at risk of disappearing from the Alcoan Portland plant.
Due to the closures, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculations that have been going on the future of the plant for years, first caused by Australia's strong dollar and recently the price of factory production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other owners of the smelter to also close their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says it expects Portland's production facility to remain operational, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL says the contracts are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for the contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in fiscal 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in "predictation for termination of contracts."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the capabilities to keep the smelter operational or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter."
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into force from November this year, although it still needs to figure out why it has now backed down from the deal.
Due to the industry's poor financial condition, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL's Chief Operating Officer, said in a speech to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity on an annual basis and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories exit the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians Real TV Star Kendall as September Vogue Cover Girl
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, an advertising face for Estee Lauder and performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps just following the style of the Kardashians series?), a scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest), presenting that he had forgotten his sister's cover. The video ends in a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise for their sister.
The plot is clichéd and is used in almost all the birthday episodes of the degree shows (Seacrest utters the words, "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in some way in this public eye.
For the appearance in Vogue's September issue undeniably marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim could make it to Vogue's cover (she appeared on Vogue's cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release per year.
A number more large in thickness than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The release of the September issue cover star is so eagerly expected that in the previous two years, the magazine's images have leaked to the public even before official announcement.
Previously, September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been some model-working celebrities on the cover rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for her generation, and even if he is more of a model-working celebrity, he is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry above others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of his career when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to his reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have re-emerged when news of Jenner's performance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant stagnation of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he filmed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she appears on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from the legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will have on centres already at the limit.
In Queensland, three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services are already turned away from five people, most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
Starting in June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell said the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland Public Legal Aid Centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the essential services they need," says Farrell.
"People from violent relationships, people under the uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, separated families, unjustly laid off workers — all of them have problems with legal affairs, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable are forced to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately abandon these financial cuts so that people can receive the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clienteles, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign filed for threatening employee with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed after no action was supposedly taken after its management was told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened the employee with a gun while they were driving in the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the state campaign, on Wednesday, in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be dealt with within the campaign before, in his own words, realized that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
After filing a complaint to local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general rage when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that "second additional clause supporters" — who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — can take action if her opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to elect judges.
Trump campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for an indifferent cause and Phillip for compensation for assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him for a comment.
Phillip was not reached despite his efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revitalizes the economy and creates well-being — not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the point that was most interested in Heathrow, and as at the 2012 London Olympics, we invested tremendously in making our entire nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the areas near the airport.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and increase the economy by £111 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and by keeping on budget with a £11 billion infrastructure investment program that included the T5 terminal — which has been voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years — and a T2 terminal built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow to guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of Heathrow's Board of Directors and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
Companies that earn their money from online advertising have turned into cat-mouse play, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block adware programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it told that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would change the ad entry codes on its desktop site so that it is harder for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says it has figured out the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "such sphering between the open source ad blocker community and the diversions has been going on since the ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own correction move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that ad blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad blocker programs, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad blockers in its desktop app, as the spokesperson said mobile ad blocking programs do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads remains high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update the user settings ad tool so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, as it also says they prevent some regular Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email bulletin.
"Advertising programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that is why we have instead invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
Woman commits suicide by dropping under cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for eyewitnesses to help on the freeway from an accident in the first hours of Thursday, in which a woman deliberately dropped under more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by lying down on a dark road, and she was hit by more cars," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and she was clearly aiming to commit suicide, and among the overrun cars was a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
Police say many motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. Police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
In the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says that a criminal investigation has been launched, a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be charged.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
There have been two similar cases over the past five years that do not keep motorists responsible.
According to the newspaper, in either case, a person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted against him for manslaughter after he ran into a man on an A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court ruled that the driving style of the police — who was responding to the distress call — was justified and the man lying on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable".
Anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
NASA's new climate model estimates that Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions on Venus may sometimes have been similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and anhydrous on its surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by the researchers, Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to the Earth and has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early Venus topography.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
"In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its day is per sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This heats the surface and generates rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than the current temperatures on Earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, only a thick carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained —i.e. Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modelling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to give up his position as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey activities, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado's vice president/Director General Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start seeking a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been doing my position as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations with vigour, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 in a statement.
"Over the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the coach and club's vice president of hockey operations must be in exactly the same line with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as Avalanche's head coach from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made the season in the last two years.
Avalanche achieved 39-39-4 points in the 2015-2016 season and was five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card position at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers begin negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say that wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against Wood Group, a company that provides oilfield services, on drilling rigs under the control of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
The parties' joint statement states that "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh aspects.
Trade unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in over 25 years, in protest of possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut about 9% of the tariffs of its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10% drop in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
The company says additional cuts will give it the room for manoeuvre necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to enhance its operations after its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation, as a result of the UK decision of June to leave the European Union, are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts that have been experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that is beneficial to many and not just a few," says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to about $7 billion spent on them over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster to date.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech University's infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching their adulthood.
They are spinning faster than ever.
With the rotational speed at its peak, large amounts of star wind erupt from the stars.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by following the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — larger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see Pleiades' 'dance' that slow-rotating ones are typically larger, while the fastest rotating are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory that allows the properties of stars to be compared to the rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar of theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information on how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiad rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
