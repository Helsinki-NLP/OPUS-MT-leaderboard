28-year-old chef found dead in mall San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and states, "His business finally went well."
The body, found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Franciscoan Frank Galicia, a San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was defined as a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC Canal KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a line chef in Boston, had been given his dream job as a line chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missed very much," the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank was initially staying in hostels, but that recently "his business was finally going well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Doctoral trainees to strike: Calls for new industrial action measures
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to accept new industrial action in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking the entire Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the contract that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter released Thursday night via Twitter to members, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "insistently silent" on issues she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to empower the gradual and expanding industrial action programme that will begin early September.
The dispute has resulted in medical trainees participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of BMA medical trainees, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the 54,000 medical trainees and students voted that the contract was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an outsider consortium?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, we shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he didn't get much of heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I went crazy on the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian general public has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on a truce for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed in last month's failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by the ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists off the Turkish coast each year.
This number has fallen by almost 90%.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup d'Ã©tat.
Adding a long-standing grudge over the snail's rapid negotiations with EU membership, Putin, eager to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West, comes forward.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a given to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the flashy seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to introduce a "external consortium", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel that the West abandoned them and mistreated them, joining forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be eloquent that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president knowingly avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster as a NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up these goals.
Bank strategists have been using the 'RBS' brand in this time to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except the headquarters and stock exchange listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "TheRBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and employees because we now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move towards the brand bank because basically (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on customer needs, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Prediction and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win
Racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000rd British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in the evening with his second win on his home track while competing with John Gosden-trained Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who previously won with Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, this is not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilection out after victory.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in obstacle races - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical wit separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a flying landing from a saddle formed as a trademark.
From drone-to-fly landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A pile of wins in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane accident and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time at first when he returned after six months of non-compete, but he showed significant strength of character in challenging the doubters and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move away from the position of head of the Russian presidential regime", but he was not given a reason.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, says the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as the Soviet security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticalism.
In his comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complex task for four years, I might even say a laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the state security service KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the state security service FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned as president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and strife on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from a series about the team of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds, and I've given it everything I can for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a vortex of water.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material on the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing Overpass: The bridge now extends to Fife
Â£1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry's transit site with the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "covers" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rake ropes.
The Â£1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry transit site.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has spent over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the lock between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover for the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first lock in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern column road deck, we then had to close the remaining section from the northern, i.e. inland, side.
This was done by pulling the land bridge of the northern fairway 700 millimeters in the south direction.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled about 3% at the slope angle.
Demanding because the allowable dimensional deviations that the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky while alive"
Three men are "lucky while alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alert at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on their own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," Vince Jones, the helmman of the Moelfre lifeboat, said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken to a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow come off the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
PokÃ©mon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Over the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
PokÃ©mon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then to video games, and now to smartphones recently.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called PokÃ©mon Go. An app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they created a series of drawings, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded servers.
In just days, PokÃ©mon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for PokÃ©mons that are tracked using GPS, and which can be "photod" (by phone screenshot) or "wipe" after discovery.
The generation that played the game when he was younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing PokÃ©mon Gota, it only sees the training level data.
The calls for many public health campaigns to "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have yielded no result because most public health warnings are boring and are passed on by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly mobile people have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of PokÃ©mon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how you cover the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving spoilers are looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously applications like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty will disappear and the use will subside in time.
However, due to PokÃ©mon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity controversy.
Simone Biles is immune to all of that.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on a perm.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
He had clearly better overall points than the silver medalist and "Financial Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the United States balance boom in the finals of the women's scaffolding multi-matched individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to successively win the multi-match championship, and overall the fifth American champion, while strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings his sport to the same class as other athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mix of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The last test awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors as between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning the family home to Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the multi-match of women's scaffolding gymnastics in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination of the starting party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes the flip-up of his trademark - is adapted to Latin American music that would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force force.
He hasn't lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He reached the top with boom points at 15,433 and crossed them by getting 15,933 perm.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose to the eyes of Biles' glitter red, white and blue, when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in the split third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call "grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent jet kisses to the public after his perm performance in emotional turmoil for a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Party, the widespread tweet of this 19-year-old from this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot in serial murder while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack of Phoenix's first serial killer incident in the last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as was stated in a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12 June.
The statement reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired the handgun up to eight times and then escaped by another vehicle.
Police said the triple killing did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or the other adult victim had $2,900.
Phoenix Police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over the past four months, which have been carried out in two predominantly Latin American districts.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of a home," Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they were often sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police bulletin on the shooting, which occurred just half an hour before the triple killing, targeting an empty convertible, believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shell casings, bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "The situation is getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike a large number of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth shows how to sign with Edmund's invented sign "sing for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a regular sign language - he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction in a long time because I don't expect anyone to be able to really give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
Things get easier.
You can believe it's getting easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over its banks and caused widespread flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Safety and Emergency Response Office, said they would receive requests for high tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five centimetres of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a peak flood record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding in Ascension County lower along the river as the flooded rivers slowly fall into Lake Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was the highest ever level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers still pick people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were on Friday near Gloster among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that the water from Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It extended all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that he has not seen the water of a stream so high in the 48 years he has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have injuries, and that he is the only one to swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods are "spreading rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a member of the city council said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said that authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tides.
Guards have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They'll be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high tides, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The latest major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said on Thursday a handful of houses were reported flooding, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
"Full of bullets" six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered several gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be a shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The shell casings of the attack, which come from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also got hits.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, police are investigating the surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old girl, was hit in her hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the involvement of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to successively win individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison as they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Financial Five" because there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts mainly practice in private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring cheaper and available gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 city youths (mainly blacks and Latinos) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work performance.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We are living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young femininity.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff members, but 58% of 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was "on unknown ground", and that even small additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to the nightly and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Interns Committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it is accelerating the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When there is only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced a reluctance on the government side to participate and at times deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his doors will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the sanctions, and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he doesn't, the medical interns are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to act as substitutes for doctors on strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with staff members of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical trainees so they wouldn't go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Working battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caretakers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of the Control Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the ongoing positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England Education Organization and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a paying drug of Â£2 a day after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NICE, an NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack in England each year, with a quarter of these having another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material accumulated in the artery wall that forms stenosis.
If stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes off, it can travel with the blood and cut the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression-preventing treatments, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of regeneration can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we recommend ticagrelor tentatively, we are pleased to add the available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially in terms of the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, treatment is not recommended in the draft guidelines for longer than this period.
Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, today is revealed in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles scolds police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud because of "race and religion-related hypersensitivity".
The former community secretary, the current anti-corruption emperor, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests that an indestructible ink be put on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or a working group.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud is found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern in voting for election fraud by mail, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proving identity by ID
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with ballots by post to stop "voice collection".
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use indestructible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made votes and envelopes through the mail where votes are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polling stations illegal.
Requires that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is killing the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court remained as a result of a number of corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty without suspicion on the basis of numerous grounds, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized ineffective "tick-box checks" in the city council voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets conviction was a revival.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a source of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy about Kate's cyclist double creature and other celebrity-appeared photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag with his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures surfaced, where he looks frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of social media fervor, the archer admitted that he has heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe with the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's great, expressive eyes have been said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sports version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal guitar Yulia Efimova has more of the same as actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team resembles "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt" according to fans.
Tough Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar facial shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities as well
Presentation of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarity of a pair
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress do indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator makes apology after saying Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place of women's 4x200 metres freestyle message enraged viewers of the CBC live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when she began sharing some of her own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring "color," was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the second leg of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Taylor Ruck of Canada, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers from all over Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the 4 x 200-meter message final of the women's freestyle as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China, baby."
Review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was thick and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group. #disgusting."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance being posted.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times from people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russel, a commentator, had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person."
" Needless to say, I didn't mean it disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primerk's client dismayed by a woman who brazenly adapted underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know where to look when she undressed in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after evaluating what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually matched four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where she adapted underwear and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store, said that after trying underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of featured underwear, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her fit.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to reconcile, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone was staring while he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for another three pairs before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting up."
Davidson, 33, a 33-year-old in the city of Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone else is taking his underwear to their home that someone else has tried but has not been cleaned."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the items of clothing from sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has dressed them and stripped them off and they haven't been washed."
A Primark spokesman said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been removed from sale."
This allows you to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrach, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers in close proximity.
Whether approached from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker in kind.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to turn around is to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
You then grab a gun between the forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to the curl, twist the gun out of his hands, punch him with the back of the gun in the face, and back off, keeping the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point a gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places for travel guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
A host and travel writer from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each object was licked, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment that was made into a film called Internal Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train flush button used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in the mouth of bad taste.
Wright became a well-known tester of the endurance of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from public rail station rail railings to the toilet seat flush button, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film made, he said, "Since childhood, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth since dirt, worms and muddy water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer's result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, on the trail of Inner Power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting here.
On the trail of inner power, the Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help enhance people's gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'Let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the documentary, added, "Let's just say it now: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked of him, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things that were licked were easier for Ian, while some were quite tricky.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows recorded."
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to abdominal and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of bullies destroyed a rented house in Cornwall Saltash, before eviction
The bully family caused Â£50,000 in damage to their rented house after being evicted due to terrorization of neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Cornwall's Saltash after numerous complaints about them.
After being forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property to be in poor condition.
There were gaping openings on the walls, floorboards had been torn, waste had been applied to the floor, and the walls were smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property cannot be repaired.
He said, "This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family's tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was in the lease, received a decision on antisocial behavior in June.
Many rooms in the house under threat of demolition found old waste.
The floorboards of the property from which drugs were previously transmitted had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted a woman and her partner's property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, time to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and things have always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often invited to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rented house.
He added, "It's a shame that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last course considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, as the conduct was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave community members who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Housing company employees now need to clean the waste stacks surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and Â£1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a B-grade drug with the intention of handing it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless after now remaining in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the rooms in the house had been snorted graffiti.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept past really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
Right now, terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a full beach.
Dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost within contact of sun worshipers on the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they understandably began to worry about the noise from the jet, although they did not initially see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it seemed like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one was at risk for safety.
The terrain fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died from them on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that had hindered visibility, smoke from wildfires, and thick fog
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half-year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made 3.4 million euros better than planned in January - June.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the sequences of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously generated by the surplus.
The portion left over it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers Taken a Military Whale in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in by a military oath on Friday.
The military oath of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The whale event for the tenth special border ice cream course was held in the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special border lichens are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special Border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the jury included five wartime border troops veterans.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A pie ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The unit's operation is invisible from the outside.
At the HÃ¤me Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and HÃ¤meenlinna.
It is pulled by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief supervisor is Lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in HÃ¤meenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian uniforms.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero SeppÃ¤nen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations for the rest of the police.
In HÃ¤me, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of the police's working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less often not leave the straws until they receive an alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily policing where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, leads the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have computer skills better than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, alarm mission database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible in the work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the author forms a certain kind of image.
Speculation can be done either on the basis of the method of action or on the basis of the person, depending on which the police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit employees do not run the collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both themselves and criminals are not reported, as it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police will publicly report the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
For example, such a case was the method of marking empty dwellings reported in early summer, used in housing burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment, with which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the district court minutes, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to thieves with gloves on.
Deputy Police Chief Tero SeppÃ¤ from HÃ¤me Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami JoutjÃ¤rvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
The background is a decrease in the number of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform that ended in 2013 until the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of one's own institution and Finland.
ISIS-joined schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she just died while planning to escape from a war-torn country and her return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and will for others, that there are real risks associated with going to the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect the person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicts "some degree of certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "boil the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans who block Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "cashions" and "possibles."
He said Trump was not suitable for the post.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, which contains plenty of nude photos, differs from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
"We need to start showing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release in which the calendar was released.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill out a comment section with irritable insults written by the nickname NoAllLonely Middle-agedMen, note that this claim is based on actual information.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken re-emergence of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but because of the longing of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought vinyl are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, they are most likely to buy records in the 18-24 age group.
It is also not just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but it involves emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign up loudly before I stopped, form a cup of my hands, and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's look into it in more detail.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies stores now fill buildings with independent shops in the past - a handful of stunning specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while as I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these stores as I try to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in their twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and touring shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can rebuy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that disc buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and have a need to buy their old records back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have gotten rid of their collection usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community to like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar record covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage days of happiness.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee said suddenly from the pile of records.
An April opinion poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought vinyl records the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "ward" perspective of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who also works at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a large part, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
Not older people, but younger people, late-aged people who are just getting excited about it.
In Fop, where there is now almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the stores mentioned earlier - the latest synth and sex-filled pop from the speakers, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is difficult to prove true by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching the various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending much money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collection is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on the computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm studying jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter pondered the purchase of Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase with walls covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyls".
But given that even the slightest attention these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths to get more, there's not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard in school or office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings hanging around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy 30-year-old fake television host as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied the shark, says the record is for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years, five meters long.
French court rejects application to land shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office justified that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a non-tax co-economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 temporary trades, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people living in "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe of the camp, which is non-profit and provides 200 meals daily, English and French hours, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food is sharply cheaper in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9%.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen most in those EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
Of the comparison countries, only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are shown in an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to 1994 prices.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed by the bans on food imports imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for affordable food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, Finland would sell the third cheapest food from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average in EU countries and continue to compete on prices," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes with VAT rates are indicative.
School is no longer exactly the same.
A person returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools operate.
The schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, learning fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is being practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already being read in four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lasting vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks, Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It may live another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic clam, the oldest known individual of which is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres tall.
Because the growth rate is slow, monitoring shows that only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493 and 502 centimeter Amazon fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired to nearly 300 sellers not cut
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The cooperation companies in a company that ran into difficulty ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction in approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It says that the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of support functions are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At their start, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction in population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realized next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company's goals.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was driven especially by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter revenue and results ever.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, at the corresponding time, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will contract from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low pressure centre on top of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona LÃ¡ng.
There are also rain showers in the central part of the country, but further south are pout.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
The rainy areas of the north remain at 10-15 degrees.
Kenya athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in the surprise test.
Doping officials came in to Anzrah's authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner has any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is a favourite of Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was on an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch athletics.
On Friday, the struggle for athletic medals was started in Rio, but the world's top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day morning games and 65% of the evening games have been sold.
The second one was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulging from the cheering people.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The lookout of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, the stands were only 70% full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30% of the 12,000 stands were filled.
The bad thing is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not able to complete the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organizers, said 82% of tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost nearly half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were empty seats at Rio Stadium this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem bearer rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire the right of holder for a fee.
The holder will be vetoed in its 187 square meter block, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be obtained for more blocks.
The acquisition of the right to control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha LeviÃ¤kangas, who acquired the right of control for his company.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information from their block, which allows, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website shows the name information of those who have acquired the holder rights on the same map where the area block information can be found.
LeviÃ¤kangas sees its conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the worst from large cities - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are the worst tormenting Turku from the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in nine other largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated on the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts of them per 1,000 inhabitants has been stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, double the number of thefts occur relative to the population," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the Police Board.
The police in Turku wonder why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much you move around the city on wheels and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu ÃikÃ¤s.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely depending on what the study and cycling cities are.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," Reen says.
In Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police become aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts annually.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're in large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are clear.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Events are also clear in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly for the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo LeppÃ¤mÃ¤ki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from, for example, bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja are the most stolen from individual wheel models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up on sale, for example via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not been reported to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad much," Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be careful, as he may commit a concealment crime or offense.
"Alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries its colourful Nopsa every day to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, Moose says. "Never taken, there has been a good monk in that regard."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be hipster value here either," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike snooped against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"I'm going to think about it a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned," a Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time, you hear from the guys that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, those kind of rag Jopos."
A bike was stolen from the courtyard of the housing company a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, though, so Valve could expect it to be usurped.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try peer-to-peer jury familiar from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer-to-peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by the young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury discuss what happened with the offender and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends for his actions.
Other consequences may include a letter written to a family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"Everything guides the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that not everything gets ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modeled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel but reflects on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio, service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of people under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you'll continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
The open letter was directed at Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for US families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the US economy will go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a handhold for American workmen who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder people, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the withholding tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president] I am against any trade deal that works against employees or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced Monday by Republican Donald Trump for "favoring only millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed heavy reduction in corporate taxes has previously called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products in America himself," Clinton said.
Such are Rio ratings: The games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators so far.
At one time, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over one million.
So far, the Olympic sports have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached nearly half a million spectators for the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that spectators are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are spectators from 20,000 to 500,000 all that time, that's a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large number of Rio race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the lame interest - if someone considers it lame - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of viewers has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get the network ratings until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other minor technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained that should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are visible in Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne, with a depth of 95.3 metres in RistisselkÃ¤.
It may be even deeper.
Technology dive trainer Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square metres in RistiselkÃ¤, the bottom of which the dive computer looked 104 metres deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and PÃ¤Ã¤jÃ¤rvi extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great JukajÃ¤rvi, 23 meters.
When viewed in this way, PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne cannot reach the 10 deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: The last piece repaired, where the deepest lakes in average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax sale: Taxation of pensioners still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came up in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter heated up opposition representatives in Parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) of election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Orpo for their desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been easily achieved.
He says that sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It is done by labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It will be needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged unemployment to be seized in the threshing
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in a budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of increasing the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at the moment, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the Constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, there is an ethnic-national conflict related to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, in the past, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will probably affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours, with 11 bombs exploding across the country, including tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in a tourist destination popular with Finns, a holiday island in Phuket at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current reports say they did not claim any deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to local authorities, yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, head of the military junta who controls Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister for Security Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators' purpose has been to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the guidelines of the crowd about caution, Westphalen says.
In wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks that have taken place during the Finnish night and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as a sight.
Thai PBS says police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN says that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 and Russian Alija Mustafina was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for rack championships at the Rio Games on a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been mastering women's gymnastics as much as they like for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-way and permanno championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last and the other year.
In the US team, Biles has won two world championships in the team competition.
The fainter World Cup medals Biles have a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, then hardly this one either.
The office of Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard of the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the main street shops were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At 3:30 a.m., Thai time in Patong had normalized traffic and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who has visited the site of the attack.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men who fit the description, hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russia's Leader on Changes: Clear Depreting
Russia made the highest-ranking leadership change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gone into trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was made to a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Persecution to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the height of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old curves, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri PynnÃ¶niemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle to younger.
ISIS fighters use civilians as human shields when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and that the data had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the title Games.
He injured his hind thighs in the early part of the season and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Around Poria Bolt, it underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the initial 200 metres at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, where he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career measuring the cap with a clock.
World records in Berlin at 9.58 100 metres and 19.19 in two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
In 100, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens's 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost any time in the finals of the title Games during his reign in Beijing if he has only made the journey.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to a fraud start.
Bolt turns 30 in over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the last finish line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: two athletes suspected of doping violation
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio home due to a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for him.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio in 200 metres.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the confusion before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be a thriller and maybe startling, but he insists he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers do the job and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grinned.
You know what?
It is a stir from nothing if it comes from (the host's) dress.
I'm a little amused if one of these has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests over suspicion of terror
Rio police announced Thursday that it had arrested two people due to suspected terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with the security oversight of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed on the popular WhatsApp service, among other things.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament games in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police let the audience in after controllingly blowing up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was able to enter after police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only let the public into the hall after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
Spain, which started the two losses, won Nigeria with a score of 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain reached silver.
Police performed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious finding was near the road cycling finish site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their first round of Rio basketball games in front of empty stands.
Argentine lady poke PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren - Finnish pondered protest
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren was going through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat Tuuli PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He was stuck due to the crash, and others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete long considered protest.
It was not worth doing so, because it would have been pointless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left in 27th place with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
The crash with the tip had little effect.
Friday is an important day when you are raced 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says prolongs age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring more years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person cannot control can bring him or her additional years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't always have to spend money - just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to discover the secret of long life through a variety of studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "a reduced risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Another study that suggests that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived to be older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
This claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway investigated how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project watched over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend life.
Unfortunately, having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in their life, they also need to have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings more years, there is no denying it.
However, achieving a long life does not require absolute pass.
A study at Oxford University found that women with big butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it is an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor at the Olympics, he is more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings more years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for their part, allows for recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be pursued.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 found that a person shopping daily, probably less likely to be older than a shopper.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring death forward.
So put the credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from umpihuma derailed into a truck
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car bar crash took place in Koskel, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred on Koske, mid-Friend of Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that met had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck remained in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into a ditch and then across the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Postman sends loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy selection had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to SeinÃ¤joki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in PerniÃ¶, was buying loose candy at Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our cargo to SeinÃ¤joki!
We can get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
So if there is no traffic in lawn mowing, the sign said.
The shopkeeper's foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is available for Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention this issue has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her own favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few laurels were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages were misled yesterday in the wrong place (SeinÃ¤joki) and we no longer went out to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not indignant at the sign because she found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.
Dizzi losing weight! 30 pounds lightened Lotta Backlund posted a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slimened dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed at normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has gradually lost about thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos on Instagram for his soaring performance.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has collected several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, though.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel on the same journey," the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach the normal weight, which was then ten pounds away.
During the three-month fitness course, five pounds eventually dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered by a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed their nurse training there.
The veterinary station recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and fearless of work.
Good Friend.
We still cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in KoskenkylÃ¤, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder knew no woman and had no connection.
The murderer was tracked by police dog BÃ¶rje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest.
BÃ¶rje survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a conviction for violations of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, Kanta-HÃ¤me District Court estimates in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and 2,000 euros in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor's salary, which corresponded to the share of induction throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU's decision on the introduction ban.
During the November post strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarize themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Journalists' Union asked SipilÃ¤ and Soini to express their concerns about Turkey's freedom of speech and press.
SipilÃ¤ and Soini say that Finland repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin dismisses head of his regime - replaced by Persecution of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin says.
The grandson of Karl Vaino, Communist leader of Soviet Estonia, will be replaced.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, is moving to special tasks in environmental and transport matters, according to a Kremlin statement.
Putin said Ivanov had himself requested a transfer to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not seen at Premier League opening
The world record man for football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid 105 million euros from Pogba to Italian club Juventus, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniac madness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent," says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves like to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think so.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
A week before the event, he knew that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of 70,000 people last year by 5,000 people.
The festival will also feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because something needs to be funded.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been inflated so that the area, partly decorated with artificial turf, has 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, the venue this year will be a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for Kallio is that even large visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "cruise things" such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but the festival, which combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul, is not the most typical performer.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it is probably the last time he will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were blown up while tourists began to leave their bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who lived in Asia, tweeted a eloquent picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, a second double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang city.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently taken up the activities of criminal organizations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to take combat missions until several months after taking a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable in a war situation.
According to the Head of Education, the reservists belonging to the rescue force are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used for military operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for home house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in order of demolition in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to 132,000 euros, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as 198,000 euros.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District and Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court's judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of 150,000 euros.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of 47,344 euros in legal and settlement costs for the couple.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the dwelling had already been known to buyers when the housing transaction was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the resulting building errors were substantially more serious than had been suggested.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the condition inspection report do not harm.
The fitness check report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that there was any urgent issue.
Tola and Waroma remained in the impression that rainwater from the cliff should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections conducted in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which Witnesses say were due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air could also be accessed indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows for health risk, exceeding the limits was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
There was also a dispute over whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of information received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also registered Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter about how the National Archives in Maryland, USA, have a total of 218,500 women stored on microfilms, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency was under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true of women who were to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the matter.
The Race Agency investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations to the Race Agency from loved ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the website of the United States Holocaust Museum says.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supporting children.
The German mother's cross of honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
PetÃ¤jÃ¤ Siren sixth, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third at the first departure of Finnjolls Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was the top of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
The Irish rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren fought at RS:X-class day departures in places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤'s Fairytale Castle was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so hung up"
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ has been a favourite artist for Finns for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, who has been the star of dance stages and festivals, can still be a snooze and he is currently in a wild lift.
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ - The book Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today Thursday.
In the book, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ tells about his life and career for good or for bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to total takeoff as he won the tango king's crown at the SeinÃ¤joki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka KuoppamÃ¤ki had composed a tango song for SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The storylinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
From recording a piece that became a huge hit, you would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfect and top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence about the most popular songs of the man, which the book tells us about, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ resigned from his then partner and the case eventually ended up in the texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song words ordered from Saara TÃ¶rmÃ¤nen were not what SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the difference were not true, but was written on the basis of 7 days news.
In the newspaper's news, the reason for the divorce between Jari and ex-lover was reported to be Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and was not true.
Jari called the record label furiously, according to the book, and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good for that.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the gap and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls for voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions almost unanimously supported staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase "It's the economy, stupid" of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, flew into a piece of junk in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly smittened by the BBC's equity, which gave as much room to economists representing only a couple of percent economists representing the EU's withdrawal as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations are in view of the consequences of the breakup.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not think have common interests.
Academics of big cities such as economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant is congesting your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center waiting room can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get out of school if they were rid of?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors to the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of the pro-EU camp, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large-scale liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily listed real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth Â£3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately Â£20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp in favour of leaving the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimates that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
Together, these robbed the situation and put the matter in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good situation due to the cash collected, but it too had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not really close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, as it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
It was quite steady since then, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental Europe funds, for example.
However, there were a lot of surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate fund trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
Open funds affected by closures control about 4% of British real estate.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties in 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn downwards, but the situation does not look "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is a 15% cut in the market compared to the period before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings down to London real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look very good yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the head of real estate investment at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
There's a word of strength in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B now," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens normally set silent at the office shunned the news, and usually loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell of his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live, Vanhanen says.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, or Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was in a way calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK, and especially London real estate market.
London office space was expected to down to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a group of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the bully has subsided, but uncertainty is still rife in the air.
It is not visible on the face of Vanhanen, who spent its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He still thinks it is far too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First data have already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The data of CBRE, a real estate service company, on price developments, cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all London properties fell by 3.3 percent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus was 6.1%, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, even because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen does not think that the comparison is quite apt, as this is a home-woven crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also found normally.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is no wonder to him - one could have been ahead without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world's number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have been rising for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, with the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to become globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have become new players in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are also looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, decentralize
In London, price increases leveled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's coming.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any surge to come.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a descending or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more shops up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get out of the pits by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping data in more detail than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group said today it would start collecting more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once data has been collected on the total receipt so far, the group will also start collecting it from purchased products in early May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and used for marketing subject to permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousanomat.
He said Kesko would not react to S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers to ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, for example, do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planned for now.
Suomen LÃ¤hikauppa has its own First Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or product product products, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and on what day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like K Group or S Group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program is to be reformed in the future, but LÃ¤hikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, basic data have also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method are stored from the S-Front Card Purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
As of the beginning of May, product level purchase data will begin to be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
Customers have been hoping for a long time that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in the bag anyway, whether you like it or not.
The wish can check their stored data on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black Labrador Retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite toy.
From the box Heila sat next to, a jar of gunpowder gas was revealed.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and online store main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko GrÃ¶nberg, Customs Senior Inspector.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs' duties is postal items passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made approximately 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives and their precursors at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail items.
In ports, it will be a big benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says GrÃ¶nberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
GrÃ¶nberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says GrÃ¶nberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs, as well as the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include brisking and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from the one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila immediately returns a soft toy cover from the "loose" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on top of the work vests, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60,000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active workloads only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a fierce competition in Customs for the owner of working dogs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for Heila's owner.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
Fiji Olympic gold in rugby, with a population of less than one million people, is valued so high that the government has set August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded from 175 pounds in his last attempt after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening quality for the lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of pushing in Rio and 145 pounds for the rapture.
His total score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get 175 pounds in his last, as did the other.
On the third attempt, the weights rose, accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian nod Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a contract to the end of the season with Estonian nod Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team with power and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good option," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in SeinÃ¤joki, where the Rovaniemes meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who is familiar with the kind Alex Dunphy of the modern Family comedy series, is back on showing off her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to be much bolder.
The star has posed in pictures she published on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, which is on the eve of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of himself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show up, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more there seems to be a bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years when the downhill is already so hard," says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge you to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, annealing young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their northern lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in autumn and continues into the long spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a fairytale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign are wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fidi's master class leading to gold
The UK's impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's finale on Thursday night when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in reading, chewing, evasive, supporting game, running lines and sheer power when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of Britain's day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby starter tournament, which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tough 7-5 win of the semi-finals from South Africa, which was played earlier that day, could bother them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 people in this condition.
The UK may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss of Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they only lost one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started excellently, fighting British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running buses moving towards the direction, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the finish area in the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai's second biopsy on the right side led to the goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it was just a slow-motion for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left on the watch...the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the situation when taking a break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is really the case.
The UK made a bunch of changes during the break that blocked Fidi's dam...for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was well until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for the UK while scoring at the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last minute goal had a frosting in Fidi's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fijians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit 20-5 in the Japanese semi-finals, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish area with dazzling footwork and scored under the goal poles in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of England's 15-aside rubby team, secured the win and finally a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 tough races towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three votes on the boat, and Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time as the two raced their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's pair race - the first women in British sports history books that achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with swan grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind each rowing gold is a group of helpful hand pairs who gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, after being diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, it was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't operate, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start their treatment in early 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first in the couple's thoughts was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment on Afghan deployment, said, "I've been an emotional ruin this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he is very grateful, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors could not reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very attached in a moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we tried to do nothing special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we're just looking for good rowing and winning the race, and we did.
The couple wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to change government with Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were called for by protesters outraged by Panama data leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians had circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential election was clearly visible to those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest speeches.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would also be involved in the founding of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-favored cover burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who has no good manner and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandly expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80.
The quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Blue-green algae opacity in PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality standards set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae opacity has been observed at the PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits set in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococcal concentrations in the water on Meriniemi bathing area were secured on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae cement observed at the PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, creating blue-green algae mass as boards on the water surface.
Environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, the matter will also be announced separately on the beach's bulletin board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: Over 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism of the tax change proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed for the forest owner's clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the wood sales income.
The VM proposal starts from making a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry to prevent it from becoming a loss of capital income in forestry that would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit for tax deduction tied to the forest's return value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It is drawn too high in Hakkarainen's opinion.
As such, it will cut 82% of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing space size.
In forest policy, the forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail surprised motorists on Himanga - two cars derailed into ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rear-end drive on the Himanga in Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove sequentially derailed into a ditch, after which the person in the back collided ahead of the run.
According to the on-call fire master Harri PyyhtiÃ¤, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the car that drove behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car, which drove ahead, was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few kilometers towards the Kalajoki River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in the treatment.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues at court, prosecutor also demands murder sentence for second perpetrator
The threshing of the Muhos family home killing continues at court for both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
One received 8 years 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of killing was also convicted of aggravated endangering road safety as a young person and for transporting a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be convicted of murder committed as a young person in a 12-year prison sentence.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the District Court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as director of the child welfare unit in a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind, according to the conviction.
The director had gotten off the grip and led the young person into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled under leadership, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had been planning to escape the family home from at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lasting vertebrate, does not increase until the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world is the confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the ice shark, or holker, swimming around Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not increase until the age of 156.
The ice shark's lifespan is increased by only a centimeter a year.
Only a species of clams is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks contained radioactive residues.
Based on them, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throw one way or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change to corporate tax advocated by Donald Trump is carried out.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A truly staggering amount would not be collected, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount, 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and the bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards decided on hasty must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump said the "saved" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be waived.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
The Wave of Attacks from the Past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarises the essence of Pedro AlmodÃ³var's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronski-side satirical comedy, the preceding Skin I Live (2011) at the Tops of a Spanish Master's career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama that focuses on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modeled for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before her daughter was born, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will rise to the second female lead from the series Time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that time with a one-time and literally one-time swipe.
AlmodÃ³var films often have such a distinctive flashiness, up to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is an evenly played, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite sad, with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there and in such a way that it begins to slowly wink into the eye more as a pure form than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
AlmodÃ³var is specific in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the scene in question, do not improve in particular.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little lifeless.
AlmodÃ³var has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, Nobel Prize laureate in 2013.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
AlmodÃ³var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly evenly thick literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably to more robust drama, so many big things - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro AlmodÃ³var.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres at 12 August.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are made with a lot of cuts.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) are convinced under a budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so hard that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallupit report that the Government Party is facing a blob defeat for the Finns Party, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of whom will realize the price of influencing right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of three governments of about equal parties depends on the cant of the Finns Party to endure.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
First, the new cuts will be used to obscure the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, to soften the blow that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the SipilÃ¤ government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of reversing debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take out â¬5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise its hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts on top of the former ones in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring, what is to be received in the parliamentary elections.
These measures did not match the debt
It is quite clear that with current actions, debt is not possible, no matter how much Juha SipilÃ¤ tries to foment a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti HetemÃ¤ki at the budget information ceremony prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proven to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no attraction to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except during the stimulus policy temporarily pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs â¬3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by HetemÃ¤ki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% limit in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, maintaining unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on entirely new debt.
This is the perception of the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organisation of children's day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also devote responsibility to an individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The county, on the other hand, is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks under the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night around half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man ran away from driving the police away from fair speeding.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where further to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-legged police officer ran to the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch on PolvijÃ¤rvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curved bend to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue services lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was up to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil poured into the road from the fallen truck, which was absorbed into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in Ilmajoki this afternoon
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in LahtinkylÃ¤, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are searching for a woman about 165 centimeters tall, slim and well-groomed with white hair that extends under the jaw.
Observations and clues about the movements of the missing person are asked to call the tip number 0295440513 of the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge flow that knocked down the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepper, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially available, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of Friday night at the market.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The surge flow is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the water state of the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the ground is accelerating.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several dive currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of crash flows is difficult to predict.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in the tents in total.
In the accident, four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported mildly injured to further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
The study found that the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skincare company CaciÃ³n analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, die nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A study by Cac found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk around congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with various masks, but a more practical solution is recommended regular skin cleansing.
Tractor brakes failed, pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain any further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, leaves for a series that starts in October from better starting points than in memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common note is certainly better found than in previous periods when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani SÃ¤isÃ¤is, who continues as head coach of Rienno, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, middle defenseman of the foreign trio, begins his second term in Rienno.
The new face is 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played on Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is already underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I worked in the market and playing with women there when I noticed the ad.
The United States was setting up a floorball national team.
I am interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM-level as floorball.
The sÃ¤hly was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM series with the university for the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen were named to the national team
Josba of Joensuu-based floorball club Josba was raised by Perttu Puska and Enolainen-based Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25, who is attacking Helsinki, has played six men's national matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, 32-year-old defender of Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, has recovered from the thigh problem and is part of the national team's standard fleet with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player for SeinÃ¤joki's Gaming Brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontolalahti is the head coach of the Finnish Floorball team.
Beach volley master Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after this season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with the Finnish Finals organised by Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs in each series are eligible.
The local color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been among the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the nesting stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu tunneled.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in ElimÃ¤ki's YMCA E-girls.
On top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee pads spinning in the ankles, and huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice for the counterweight of indoor volleyball during junior years.
A beat has been played at the KÃ¤rÃ¤lampi beach since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour races thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from PieksÃ¤mÃ¤ki this weekend in SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we still lack the prize cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
The weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last audience familiar to Hasu.
In early September, new challenges await civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The flip-flops are nailed at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The crash flow knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for people with disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to the hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
The fire master Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were the ingredients for a major accident in the situation.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future even in rural areas.
Almost two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I really boldly joined the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is still going to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition for Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost of living index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016) compared to December 2015, the inflation rate has been -0.2%, with annual inflation in July 2016 being -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month in the case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog, or character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple tools that twist facial features, producing over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app promotes a blackface, or "blackface" mask, or favors bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised some users this week a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - a "yellowface" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's bigger problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had shut down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with side by side with a outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme derogacy.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes beyond these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood, and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be unobtrusive than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white male lead and finished his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak frankly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesman said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and take forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say this isn't okay."
Congressional panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a Congressional panel said authorities from the U.S. Armed Forces Military Military Mission headquarters edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events justified on the ground.
An interim report by a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the House of Representatives Defense Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among headquarters intelligence analysts who said that the superiors tampered with their estimates of Americans' efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than those justified by on-site facts. They were regularly more positive than analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," spokesman Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
Centcom's management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems in headquarters descriptions and analyses of the U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration's high-ranking administrators ordered the reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts feeling as if Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, ISIS, in a more positive light.
" Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters' press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could even begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still in ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders at the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces War Mission manipulated headquarters intelligence outputs to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq.
Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence from the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, will follow more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense Superintendent has initiated an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a process unnecessarily isolated from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," spokesman Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "longed the release of intelligence outputs", worsened mood among analysts, and "given enough space for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they could not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions to "preset or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of a Congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's chief inspector has begun an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The study has other consequences than just the question of whether the US-led bombing efforts in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defense officials now claims).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to deliver honest assessments of military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
A review of Islamic State intelligence reflects a dispute more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
Officials said last year Hooker's group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate as an overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
US wins fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organizing a showdown with Britain
The day after scoring three goals as the team won Japan's 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But this he knows: Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game determines who ranks first and who is second in their six-team group.
The first to be ranked avoids a strong Dutch, second group leader, a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, Americans have sparked controversy with their surprising success here, four years after they were the last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) related to the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He was not at the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started scoring the first half with a knuckle punch near the goal.
India had entered the game with a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball to the left side of the field for a long time, then circled into the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper in the tournament to Jackie Briggs, who had let one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The Peace of Trampoline in the Middle of the Most Olympic Frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are underway.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem like a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton, passed from archer to swimmer and from gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the line of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first timer and future heart crusher of the Olympics with his smile pit, could well be one of the names known to everyone who is presented at best time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-mind TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations in between the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize at all it was an Olympic sport.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually award men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medal.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain charm of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics in the uncivilized ear.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I am just a flightless fan.
The sport has potential for amusing, as noted by the vibration of the endless bounces of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jumps, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolÃ­n, which means springboard.
The championship seekers jump up to nearly 30 feet in height with a giant trampoline, and must perform spinning sequences of movements (turns, folds and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those who wish for medals must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt a finish line or starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another grotesque border: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and can even cause the viewer to tears.
But that's also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest from this.
The trampoline's direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, appearing weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but there is no fierce rush towards the end during the program, no jumps into the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as what can be reached at the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's races will also come on Saturday at 1:00 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon repertoire starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they provide a quiet, attractive moment that is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to stare and objectify (as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"A generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, in recent months, anti-government demonstrations have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The spread, recorded videos at demonstrations, believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations Chief Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new train for commuters.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model model of democracy; human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and have no choice but to demonstrate, this is what will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.
After last year's much criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all the seats in Parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of turmoil and arm themselves again.
Numerous factors explain why after years of turmoil beneath the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through network proxy servers that hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is changing too.
"We are on the way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, covering about 6% of the population and controlling the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Current government has no basic instinct like that," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, which was native to the tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
Ethiopia was last under such turmoil in 2005 when thousands demonstrated about elections that analysts said seemed to have been sloppy and then robbed by the government.
In the subsequent crackdown, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based ISIS claim to 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute that had taken over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been struggling to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they must explain remarks he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at the Wednesday night campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, on an early Friday morning Twitter, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump shake his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took him to his hearing ears.
The most recent review storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign amidst the results of opinion polls that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought while talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Escaped to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that she found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late July after he faced widespread criticism apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "of course I'm sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He's looking at how they work and then 'clear' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's cunning about his statements and knows they're vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more sape in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published Friday showed that Trump is dragging after Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an ever closer look over the past few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about her truth about Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to attack news media that grind every word of him and is biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to get him out, saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was unfit for president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, only cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue streetside was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a middle-class renovated city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also reinventing.
Last November, the revived Verb opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unsparated atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same type of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg cheese sandwiches, and capers and browned onions are served on the coatings, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
Beer is no longer served in the cafe, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered to the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I realized I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagelia with butter," he said.
Photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old facilities.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, which would use cold-extracted coffee in the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafÃ©.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to soon put it up somewhere to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafÃ© will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home while walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I had wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depression paralyzing food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as foie gra pastry, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree, and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life from the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some sort of their own culinary solidarity, they meet at a journalist's dinner at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, uncut lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a portion with turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple felt it was appropriate to discuss eating a depression.
"The crumbs were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanutloaf, liverloaf, bean loaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in the stomach," he said.
Years before the recession, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like eating-so-much-like-jaksat-picking table.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal book chronicled the ways the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, inexpensive diet: Mystery dishes such as cereal and boxes became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compilations were tried with calorie intake and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman also prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Service from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and meet the challenge of converting pureed spaghetti and carrots-like lumps into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxed-down dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on her own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only one of Washington's most dreary, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the paralytic eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The tradition is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
The dessert had no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly sank their spoons in a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe skewed once and twice.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead to be reimbursed for attorney costs in hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
A U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc. to be entitled to the attorney costs it incurred in the case of a hepatitis C patient dispute against pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. This release followed when a U.S. judge discovered Merck's abuses, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to be exempt from the compensation it incurred in opposing the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the Gilead pharmaceutical active substance sofosbuvir.
US-backed forces say they have completely taken over the Manbij, ruled by ISIS.
US-backed forces have taken over the northern Manbij city completely near the Turkish border since the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 strainer prisoners held captive by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse had a income of $10.75 million in that year, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster for his book, which reported his career at the State Department.
Clinton's running candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, released 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises of publishing his tax returns.
According to the custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax government's audit as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he released a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are ready.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties with Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem, releasing an online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his toll.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that on Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he too has a tax government audit, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Today, Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, had a real federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an affordable, indexed mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The resort has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, invented several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, along with the American Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent four-step way of protecting homes and crops without being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have observed a change in attitude in these communities, and they are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing an invading elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground, as well as a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted so that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
One snort is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ release.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country area code list provided.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of the explanation, the filmmaker raised the issue at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there "shocked him".
The hotel's prescriptionist said it was "a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli area code," the employee reportedly said.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the incident "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and this hotel chain.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "rendered" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Fear," said another publication that noted that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "unobservable" and "recovered" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the express selection list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse a group of students, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to the proposals of Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out as one force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested, as the country's Senate voted on his impeachment.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown great interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, totalling $856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran in particular rose by 91.5%, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16% to $158 million.
"The growth of the trade was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representative in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited in Russia for the first time.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian storms in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner plunges to finish as British catch cycling gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland vindicated the men's team sprint at Rio Cycling Stadium last night when a trio of the UK team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man as he reached the finish line, catching the victory favorite from the New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing at the sixth March World Track Race Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of special messenger Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's end also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man that British coaches held on to seeing the potential in the Scots that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in timetime, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC, and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Skinner, 23-year-old Glasgow, said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and gain fame.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming win.
Hindes said, "It felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people, who won seven out of ten cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be waiting for a successful five days at a cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic golds in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny's - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It's won together with the friends.
Winning alone is, to be honest, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-person, four-mile team rear race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time runs when officials invited him to a length measure.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been drama behind it, the least of which have not been the resignation of technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the racing career of great figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first evening races at the cycling stadium, it seems that the now legendary reputation of Great Britain to reach its peak at the perfect moment could be true once again.
Portland's smelter future questionable due to cutting electricity contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminum smelter, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when an electricity company distributing electricity to the factory revealed that one of the plant owners is closing the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the decision made by the Victorian administration earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the factory operational will not be extended.
The 20-year fixed period will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of production at the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to end their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the physical electricity demand for the smelter will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to deliver results for the financial year 2017, the electricity company said.
All potential performance impacts for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for wholesale electricity prices in the futures market.
AGL said it has already "predicted termination" reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the smelter in operation or secure a smelter's electricity supply."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why he withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been on guard both due to the smoothness of Portland in Victoria and also due to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both factories exit the market, this is a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of Vogue in September
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of the 20th model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of Vogue's desired September issue of the United States.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and modeled at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just suitable for Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and involved everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended with a classic turn: they were planning a surprise party.
It is a clichÃ©d plot pattern of almost every children's television series' "birthday" (Seacrest utters the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn bunny), but Kris had to somehow get his other girls to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion calculated that from last year's 832-page opus 615 was advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is expected so vehemently that for the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years, there have been more "celebrities on the cover who act as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, described by the magazine as a "success model" of her generation, would hit the former category, he is in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are justifiably talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of this moment".
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, spinning is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government decision was not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need each year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and crippled debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis in Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the legal center of the community and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened a gun at the employee in February while they were driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainee Vincent Bordin in Charlotte on Wednesday in a state court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After accepting local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"There is no need to launch weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of the second addition" â usually involving gun owners and gun enthusiasts â could take action if her rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's subpoena seeks compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The callback submitted to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to tremendous effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and an economic growth of Â£211 billion, as well as leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a Â£11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: the T5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway, supported by Â£16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play for blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad blocker program are "cat and mouse play," said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-based pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update the program's filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said the code on its websites is changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-trip battle between the open source ad blocking community and its tourrs has been going on since the ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the grief that ad blockers have become to the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after ad blockers of computer-based pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this type of action worth investing.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it was dailyizing its "advertising preference" tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the event have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this," lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking on a dark freeway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night," the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of manslaughter for neglect after he hit and killed a man lying on A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, were driving in a justified way, and that the man's presence on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to be habitable once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and air circles filled with carbon dioxide could have ever had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotational rate of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were likely to have drier areas on the planet than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the dayside sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the heat of the sun.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current ones.
The model produced a story of Venus' developmental stages similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at one time, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to give up Avalanche coach's job
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey affairs, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/Director General Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of Colorado Avalanche's ice hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team over the summer to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the opinion of the coach and vice president of hockey matters must be fully aligned with the organization's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We value everything he has done for the organization and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league in his first season of Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division victory, but Minnesota knocked over the Colorado playoffs in the first round, and the team has not made it to the final two years.
Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference's wild card playoff slot.
Roy, the goalkeeper elected to the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The industrial struggles of North Sea oil workers for pay are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have been arranged occasionally on North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh view of the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors' fees by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's reward deduction follows a 10% reduction of its country contractors for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest North Sea labor disputes in the generation.
He said the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in new projects is expected to invest in the North Sea, while the average for the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the rotational speeds of the Pleiadian cluster stars.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the group were born about 125 million years ago, and are right now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at their top level now.
With their peak rotational speed, these growing stars plunge large amounts of star wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by monitoring the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones of whom make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades 'balet', we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for the stars to rotate into theoretical models that comprise both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiad rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
