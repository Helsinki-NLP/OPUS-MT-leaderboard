Emili Kouki led to Hurricane's home win in opening - Savo Volley win second win
Hurricane-Loimaa, who was in the men's volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most powerful in Hurricane by 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We got the job done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Drumnen, who played in Loimu, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team hacker playing on a match-specific agreement with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought additional extra extras to the game.
Our game is not yet complete, but continuing the medal tube is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was the most powerful in Savo Volley with 18 points when the team knocked down the Ducks 3-0 by Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially at the offensive end, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the win.
I had no conscious different download when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Volleyball 3 season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling was left at home.
Miro was the king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielavesi Sampo while Tuovinen was head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful by 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoring in 2012-13, has started this season strongly as well.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win for the season after pouring Kokkola's Tigers 3-2.
The season has started off just fine.
Today was a loss near, of course, as we were in the fourth round losing 17-21.
There was a round win, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most powerful Tigers still in the finals a few seasons ago were the 28-point chipper Edwards Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's chipper, Mikkonen said.
Finland number one in the comparison of human capital in the world
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, reports the journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands finished one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the educational level of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico under control, local game ended without goal
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to a great fight, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico on loan while he was a Chelsea player.
Early this week, he was selected as goalkeeper of the year by the International Football Association FIFA.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal spot, but his shot was directed past at the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale took a break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goal cannon who moved to Juventus in the match.
The United States is now under attack on abortion rights - A powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected candidate Brett Kavanaugh appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will reverse the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell how the current situation has come to the current situation over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to extortion of laws.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending U.S. religious freedom.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were 5,000 deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortions was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, California, the abortion rights law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, that it began to revolutionaryly confuse religion with politics to gather voters.
His abortion strain was also reversed by his successor George Bush Sr.
And Donald Trump did the same.
The document reaches the deepest core of the matter in its search for a root cause for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations in favour of racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as the stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing this, the US is in a situation where the president, who has boasted with his sual harassment but who has captured the voices of the religious right on his abortion position, has elected Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now being accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on scale language status to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - major protests at border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
Two children are among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: boys aged 12 and 14.
The ministry said 505 people were wounded.
Of these 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has begun using force so protesters don't break up the border fence or seek the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 are wounded.
The protesters demanded that Palestinian families have access to areas from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's topper Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
His interpretation was that the tackle was pure.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation stayed to bother referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with pectoral muscle.
I had a taste of work for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued to the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the game was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win tube in the back.
Pedophile assistance service filled immediately with reservations - In Finland, about 40,000 people feel interest in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, those who are sexually interested in children or adolescents have found it difficult to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood and appointment times were booked very quickly in Sexpo, which provides advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
Most of those who notice pedophile feelings themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle, a sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
I think work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange at all times, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the award based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites for the Nobel Peace Prize are, based on the odds, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is considerable, as last year the intervals were still chilly.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will have the most attention, or peace prize.
If the award is not given to those who participated in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, there is one of the top candidates for Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape at his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has been working to draw attention to sexual violence, a terrifying byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he had a Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he felt he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world," the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been given to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire announcement in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and driving in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on the first road in Lohja took place on September 8.
Traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki due to the notification.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department sought to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Centre said it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road in shock and they drive how it hurts," the on-call fire master Pasi Kääriäinen told STT freshly at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction just after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts working against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, Contact Manager at Liikenneturva.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for a compelling reason.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, you cannot go and endanger traffic with hastily solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always provide the most accessible passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is making and cancelling a u-turn.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where the headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking.
There have even been cases of the driver stopping in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the action in question," Heiskanen says in a press release.
Ilves fans would have liked to have continued their party even though the ship was caught in the lakebed
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in its bow at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's chief at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the Haver.
Ilves fans would have liked to have continued their party on board until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them home by the fire department on board the fire department and take the bus home," Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to follow the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's haven was due to the fact that the water surface in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered in logs, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusesalmi shortly after the shipping route had been below the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
The larger drama was not associated with the incident, according to Syrjä, as the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, the capture to the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on board and, in this view, the cruises on the ship continue normally.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship began to be towed off the shallows.
We will still go to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere's next cruise, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue services received an alert for the incident on Saturday night shortly after half past 12:30.
Ambulans were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
On-call fire master Matti Willman told me late at night that evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and rather strong wind.
After 3:30, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that all those on board have been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump judge candidate accused of harassment and drinking may be left without top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as a judge of the United States Supreme Court, may well be left without the post he has sought, says Mika Aaltola, Programme Director at the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump could end up playing the office with someone else.
It has happened in the United States from time to time that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court judge has raised a great deal of conflict.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This has allowed the president to keep his face.
The appointment would rain on the Democratic laur
The Supreme Court of the United States seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain on the Democratic Party's laurel in the upcoming midterm elections in Congress.
It would raise the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
There is no opportunity for every presidency, as Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80.
Some Republicans hesitate to be appointed.
A background report is normally conducted on the candidates of the Supreme Court of the United States, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has set only a week's deadline for further investigation by the FBI, it can still bring up something essential, according to Aaltola.
It might bring.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for the post will be discussed in a lively manner before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority vote of 51 to 49 in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be to take the appointment to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said from the photos that it was Anatoly Tshepiga, a military intelligence GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia said they had previously revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning into Chepiga.
They said they had already found evidence that the current identities of men are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-China border where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the young Chepigan Bellingcat from pictures.
He recognized the same man from images by the British police, featuring a man now calling Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Russian Hero's Medal of Honor in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
In an interview with Russian TV earlier in September, men suspected of poisoning said they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly as throwing bags in health and social services reform
A vivid example of what the change limiter for the health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä Government has now been obtained in practice.
My municipality of birth Vaala's health and social services are produced by Oulunkaari Municipal Authority, whose health services director has been elected former Regional Director at Attendo in 2016.
The heads of the joint municipal authority warn the council of the change limiter.
If health and social services expenditure now rise, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in care for the elderly, which would stop the institutional care of the health centre's ward and a small unit of memory disorders.
Home medical care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots next to the health centre for "home" treatment.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay it for customers.
The left of Vaala did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event, with many relatives, caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with slides of health and social services preparation, how the municipality of Vaala already treats the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Also included was the neighboring councillor Carina Western.
The local newspaper did a big story about the occasion, and it again put Oulunkaari's draftsmen on their hind legs.
The health and social services manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell you what level of care it will receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until hospice treatment.
Without a nurse?
The health centre's facilities are discontinued because there is no doctor's night emergency services.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaala shows how downtown officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates are put on their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party clears the residents of Vaala, who will stay there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was the centre's one election phrase that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens major mosque in Cologne
In Germany, in the city of Cologne, thousands of people demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Supporters from Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan boasted that his visit to Germany had been successful and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
Merkel, however, stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia State Prime Minister Armin Laschet withdrew their participation in the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit escalated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to an anti- Erdogan demonstration in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
Three charges of murder of journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecution said Friday that three people are charged with the murder of Kucia and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February shot with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the lack of printing, Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to common boxes has to be made from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra newspaper bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of the rest of Finland's subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
Distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala today live in his upcoming discussion programme, among others.
Vesa is in the studio telling of her upcoming space voyage, which she booked Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight that occurred in 2014, and even after the fatal test flight, things are in the right place.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, meaning that his journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km altitude, a Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Journey and saw Star Trek on televisions.
The Star Wars have been seen and that's what the idea was smoldering...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its lossless passage in the Premier League when it knocked down Brighton 2-0 on its home ground on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by goal sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season at close range to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute on the backpost of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he sawn with Sterling into pieces of Brighton defense in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finals at the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City, which started the season, leads the Premier League with a 19-point catch.
Liverpool, who played one game less, however, lurks only one point away.
Liverpool will face the third Chelsea in their seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen was elected as Vice Chairman from Häme.
The council elected 40 actual members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Society informs on Sunday.
The youth club meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for quality and safety.
In fact, the Young Society Meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operating goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organize equal recreational activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Society says in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "Losts a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of Mercedes was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel in the World Cup points by 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen will not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his examples.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
F1 season continues on Sunday with a Russian race.
The race, which starts at 2 p.m., leaves the Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football A-young SM-series championship campaign became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top level of the football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
The starting point for the championship struggle before 1 p.m. was clear: FC Lahti Academy practically has a point against Vasa IFK.
To reverse the situation in the final round, the second Ilves in the championship battle must win the PK-35 and wish for the defeat of the Lahti residents.
However, the Lahti people's championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vasa, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Lahti residents led 7-0.
One reason for the Vaasans' loss of players is that the team has played the A-young SM series, or P20 series, and the men's 2nd C-block with some of the same players.
Vasa IFK has played in Two against virtually the entire season's fall.
In the final round of the second on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.

The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof in Eno on the Casevaara Road on Sunday around 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue services reported.
Good luck was involved, the statement said.
Rescue services said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to inquiry: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, there is no fuss about planning abroad
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by making equipment purchases and training personnel.
When intelligence laws came into force, an increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be permanently added to the budget.
The premises of the Security Police (supo) on Ratakatu, Helsinki, are already preparing full head for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Head of the Coalition Party, tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startling in a video of her singing topless campaigns for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is shrugged again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account singing with her hands in front of her breasts, AFP news agency reports.
The song is a 1991 hit by Australian The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voted The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly do self-help [breast] checks," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a uncomfortable zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of skin color all over the world.
Early perception is the a and o of everything - it fears many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a stir in the background at the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams was fired at the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for much more drastic behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for height-feared people
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on a rock ledge.
You can watch the forest that is spreading below if you wish.
The rugged scenery in the heights causes restaurant visitors to gasp in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19 September 2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good bottom condition, the place says.
Korpela's alley run ends today: How it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, so happens to the domestic country drama Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week the episode was watched on television as a premiere of 722,000 Finns.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no continuation of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen's series.
In the final episode, a big leap is taken again in Jaska and Mirku's relationship, and Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is also warm, in light of recent events, downright romantic, but then Laiho appears once again.
Police are also skeptical about the man.
But no one knows Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets amazing news.
Kauko's last will is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
In a week, Sunday nights will continue with new episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people guess whether to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, reports the Prevention publication.
So it's worth staying home?
Prevention says that the flu is contagious even when the person does not have symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough eases and there is no fever anymore, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast a return to the gym slows recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, blow the handkerchief and throw the snot papers in the trash.
Painful, though?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put in the nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited with the mask.
How, then, could infections be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Hockey player and miss are often linked.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23,.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown has been given to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved to at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
For his father's Russianness, Voronkova was bullied at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina says at the semifinalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon Miss Beauty found new friends and the everyday life went rolling as desired.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when I thought this afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
Since his career in the SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and with it I would pry into a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, we do well with trust and the good thing about a remote relationship is that it will stay up all the time," Alina grinned in May.
With constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth's endurance.
Yet there is almost nothing to be given up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are sought, but even the theory of moderate economy comes across major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people over a few generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-standing crossing of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change are causing this market economy to waver in a threatening way.
Two men were stabbed on Sunday night in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in stabbing and another, born in 1968 less severe.
The older men have already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible part of the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
Events are investigated as attempted killing and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Inter's coach lamented the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the handicap of the match ending 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right side and happily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
On the guest draw, the Mariehamn people reached the difference between the series karvaja to the Turku Ball Club, which is present.
An important goal and valuable point, Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg summed up.
Lundberg said the team did not, however, break out in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately the goal of the Turks brought us more strongly into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of the home team Inter, the game was under control, but the scoring caused pain again.
One defense mistake took us a full point pot, Allen lamented.
Again we were the best!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland is ranked number one in 195 countries' comparison.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure this with human capital.
Finland ranked number one in the study, which measured the health and education and learning of citizens.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital will have a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation exists in Africa.
The continent's states took the seven worst places in comparison.
The tail is held by Niger.
This was first reported by the STT.
Lehtärä showed its underpower expertise, the slot is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underpower game emerged when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last practice game before the season began.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä pitched Michael Raffl twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display due to suspicions of drugs.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug rates, where some are suspected of drug use and some of them in sales, for example.
Lehtäri has denied committing the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the match, Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter closely following the Flyers, estimated that Lehterä is part of a group of six strikers, five of whom will get a seat on the NHL team.
In the training match, Lehtärä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehtäri fought the puck with underpower, pulled the defender on him, and pitched Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, to the open position.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers will begin the NHL season on October 4 with a away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching leadership to decide whether he will be able to join the NHL group.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Librainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Librainen, who received her hockey lesson in the river boys, played 19:31 minutes against Philadelphia.
With the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit with superiority when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves raised, defender Juuso Välimäki received a pass point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Kosk, among others.
Alexander Barkov of Florida played for over 20 minutes and pitched a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's comfort goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the goal of the losers, Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 pucks.
Already over 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey on the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already garnered over 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can still be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked if Finland should be in the same time as the other Nordic, Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
Fresh photo shows change: World's strongest man lost dozens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall, a Britishman, hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and weighed 200 pounds at its highest, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he would do harm to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size," Hall said.
The British hunted the world's strongest man race win by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram, posing in a much slimer condition than his active career.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now trains aerobically five times a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was weighed by HafȘór Júlíus Björnsson, who was also familiar from Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Supportfully caught with rock"
The inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday night in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue services received an alert for a water traffic accident on Friday night after half past 12:30.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted to the pit, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rocky rock," said Matti Willman, fire master on duty.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
Rescue services said personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland off the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus towards Tampere, on call Chief Jari Nieminen told STT after 1:00 a.m.
Ambulans were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusesalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
On-call fire master Matti Willman told earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and rather strong wind.
Rescue services say the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship apparently does not leak.
After the evacuation operation, divers begin to check what the situation is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 people.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' tonight's match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a cash dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a subpoena application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LLM Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and its late payment interest are charged a total of over 80,000 euros in unpaid management fees.
According to the application for the challenge, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has been done," Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti, telling the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastine, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Helenius and promised that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay only percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and it would have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in a message he prepared.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to Vastine, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was bad and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the cooperation ended, Helenius had been assigned an "unindividual but extensive" bill for the manager's work.
This year, a lawsuit has been filed with the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's post-term activities to be cowardly-like, the response states.
Helenius today faces the seventh Erkan Teperin Stuttgart on the heavyweight challenger list of the boxing union IBF.
A hearty man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-term radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The host's death notice was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement reports that the Päll died on September 3.
The doctor reported a serious illness on their Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He said goodbye on Facebook earlier, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio thinks Erkki Pälli is a multitalented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that the Päll was a well-liked person with fast rushers and funny stuff.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy when I was 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
We met with Erki at the time.
He was then Finnlevy's spokesperson and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times too.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to supplier work at Fazer label Toivo Kärki.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the biggest passion for the päll was radio work, where he had an original style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
The doctor retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May of the union showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The union describes the "full turn" that has experienced its economic situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management of operations has been ingrained throughout our organization, Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also done well in partner acquisition and the World Cup return was also maximum in the past competition season.
However, in the future, cost management must continue to be precise, and at the same time we need to constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital in the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Paluan who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I haven't spoken to him the last time he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP.
Dwi Haris lay in the yard of an army hospital in Palu, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the start of the quake.
The family was invited to the Return Wedding Party.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told the AP.
Small shops are being robbed
At the Palu evacuation center, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods as tense in the city.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants under themselves.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
The newspaper said the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after guards told them not to go to find their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first, an army C-130 transport aircraft landed on the airport, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without the assistance of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night of Sunday, a long rainy area spreads across the country from the west direction, the Finnish Meteorological Institute says.
Rain comes mostly as water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The frosts of the previous night are not repeating because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively under control.
Just in the west, you can temporarily visit the frost side, said meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area recedes east during the morning.
There are pout or semi-clouds in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu height at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in the marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather in the typical autumn.
Autumn is starting to push it seriously, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland finals not seen on television
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti's entertainment journalists are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet Billnäs Ironworks of the Miss Finland final.
The broadcast starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs Ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the final starts, you will be able to watch the atmosphere on the spot on IL-TV live broadcast.
Live broadcast starts at about 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the finals.
In the jury, they are represented by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other representatives of the jury include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni's Trade Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the Miss pageant.
The Russian father Dimitri and the Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Suomen Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments on the crown head.
They sat into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career as a child.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty that she should become a Miss.
But he announced he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about beauty pageants.
It was the parents' wish that Alina would be admitted to the university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This is what happened, and eventually Alina still wanted to do a bachelor's degree before the Miss pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn't participating, but he wanted to finish that cand.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a wholesome example for young people and adults as well.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri hockey for a living in Japan and couldn't get to Finland to encourage her love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for Miss Year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break from the visits because of the Missikiers.
I miss you already, even though messages have been put in.
Young man killed in hit-and-run in Lahti, police arrest three people
Police said three people had been arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of the events or the possible intent of the hit-and-run, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the people arrested and the man who died in the hit-and-run knew each other before.
Further information on the case will be available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic nonsense once left my husband's phrase, where he suggested it to a story I developed as a person, says Espoo comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator who has done economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, what would you do when you grow up, when even the smallest child started to be big.
Then in 2014, a comic book came into the picture.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintti and Asterix since he was a child.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these manuscripts of Organic Homp began to emerge then, the situation changed.
I first made some dozen manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I couldn't lure her into it until the summer of 2016, when I bribed Viivi with the help of a drawing album.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then you had to start trying yourself, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing album was a great encourager for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
I keep popping scripts into my mind, but I usually don't make it ready at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might do the screen at a time and I like to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert for contemporary comics in newspapers.
The characters in the organic nonsense are a carrot body mother who has a carrot body who has a salad hair bush.
The other persons are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced bun even though Organic Homppu sometimes pushes the matter.
Piippo says he reads his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you've drawn and say this is what I've done today.
And there are enough challenges for a housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - left no cracking tower until he could get hundreds of passengers to safety
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake has been 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people off an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when an earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer Batik Air's passenger plane into the air from the runway.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shook and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered severe visceral injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn wondered at Yle that Europe ends up in trade war: "I have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that while the tightening tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is very good for the time being.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted drastically yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
5% of the country's loan stock is problem loans and more than 10% of unorganized credit.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to again exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting further crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe into the new economic crisis.
Another issue that is affecting Europe is Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in agreement.
The disputed difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as the President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his post in just over a year.
The discussion of his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name has flashed in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included," Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further than this.
HS's super popular Black Box performances will continue again next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat continue again in the week beginning.
Other performances will be held at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not been published in any HS instrument before.
There is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a eloquent story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners thanked a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The performance that will be seen at the time has different content than this autumn evenings.
Lost mushroom cooker found thanks to "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is among the world's top: "We are being asked about training"
According to the principal of the Police University of Applied Sciences, police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a mushroom inhibitor missing in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the principal of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are also among the top of the world here as well."
The drone is a fairly new thing and even newer on police missions.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been evident, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
Increasingly becoming more common
Himberg points out that finding someone who has disappeared in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in Raahe's case, the lost was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they are to be trained more.
Already, drone is used a lot in police missions, and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for the missing, the police may use drones in areas such as accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence tasks.
For example, you already have to check out an area a little further away, where there is possibly a fear that violence will be encountered there.
The drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby rose to number one divar
The Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still halfway through the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and porched the guests of the south from 26-12.
The 2 Division Championship also knew a historic rise to Division 1 for Karelian Rugby.
Previously, the club has played in the first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby series had been divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club plans to accept the serial position, but it will know quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi begins season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens playing in the NHL of hockey, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted a super-promise in the first round of Kotkaniemi, 18, with number three in the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong excerpts in the September training matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score in his first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season will begin on the night before Thursday next week in Finland.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week, there has been a lot of talk in Finland about leadership.
Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa told HS in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but even previous Nokia reports have talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and lack of talk, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rise in risk-taking and agility disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 business world stars came on the stage.
There was enough talk of good leadership.
Gary Hamel, a legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader must dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a wide range of organic stores, said that the manager must know how to communicate to the entire staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot be just making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are reportedly humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the company's life cycle phase.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why leadership goes wrong so often, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a comrade manner.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland spectacular dress also had a lace slouch.
A little poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to a trial in L.A.
Among other things, he has done advertising descriptions.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to those in Finland.
However, he says that work must be done even harder, as there is easily always a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors a €30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural award worth 30,000 euros in Kuopio on Saturday.
Lindfors, who has won the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in the environments they have previously intervened from," the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, the award was a group of international artists.
The award is given annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo sought in major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Extensive search by the Danish police has paid off.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Sound and Great Belt.
All land and ferry services from Själlann Island were closed to Sweden, Germany and elsewhere in Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The wanted car has been found.
We cannot yet tell you where the car was found," Henrik Storm Copenhagen police said in a statement.
Storm says the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Bladet reported on Saturday's press conference by police.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the course of the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime title the matter was being investigated.
Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to the lives of people.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police will not say if they have already been arrested.
The newspaper said the restrictions on ferry services have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
The STT says that police say the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote on the matter in contentious elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
Greece says the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonian EU and NATO membership by adopting the agreement.
Voting began slowly at least at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which gained independence in 1991, has been officially called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough tension to see if the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required for a constitutional amendment.
The Greek Parliament also has to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper in a professional boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to fight in tougher positions seen on Saturday, with considerable financial importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand stroke.
Teper could no longer get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight as early as December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded for injury and withdrew from the match.
It then became apparent that the German had been fried twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 games from his professional career matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who left for the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton team order to win - difference to Vetel already 50 points
The Formula One championship was again approaching its confirmation, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup leader to Ferrari's Sebastian Vetel as early as 50 points (306-256).
There are only five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position, drove second.
Last year, Bottas, who won his career in Sochi, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who started the last starting line, was fifth.
Two assaulted a Jew man in Joensuu, caught a block away
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Juuka man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police also said the men seized the victim's phone.
Police reached the suspects, i.e. a haywater 35-year-old man and a 39-year-old man from the end of the Ilomantsian, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim received bruises who did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to reach agreement with NAFTA with US
Time threatens to run out in the middle of the US-Canada negotiations on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators from the countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canadian chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations to the fullest.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the treaty into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign the contract at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow enough time for the US Congress to assess it.
Neighbor thought candles were blazing as a fire in Kaakkur - fire department alerted to the scene
Candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue services units were alerted due to a possible apartment building fire.
It was discovered that candles burned in the sauna in the apartment apartment had looked like a fire in the house across the street, which was why the emergency services had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - brawl at the airport and metro station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match in the men's football league in Espoo, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the Western Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to the STT.
The reason for the capture was to protect against crime and disturbance.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The captures were previously reported by the Evening Messages.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators from the stands reserved for HJK supporters rushed into the field.
The situation led to push and fist fights between team supporters.
Among other things, we needed horse police to end the situation.
In addition to the field, brawl occurred in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw from the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen pointed to the brawl on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Table stone has a butterfly swim in its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablekivi have progressed to the finals on the closing day of the World Cup 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone shaved its Finnish record in a 50-metre butterfly swimming, where he was second in the early rounds at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during the SE time of the trip 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus in Espoo, was 24th in butterfly swimming during 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was sixth in the early rounds of 50 metres of breaststroke in 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
In the early parts of the two hundred metres mixed, Laukkanen was 15th in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sophoclesen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only play trilogy of Aiskhylos, Aischylus, to the tour beginning at the National Theatre.
In the Lavat open! projects that began in 2015, the Theatre Academy's acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the doomed Atreus family blood revenge and the birth of the rule of law to an hour to twenty minutes, especially by summarizing choir sections.
The work manages to be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonrau's fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the display revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasizes reduced and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between the performers who break away from the choir, who play the title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple sessions of name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and his war, Kassandra, are also shown on stage, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is loyal to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation is created before the eyes of the viewer, faithful to the text, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic set of actors in the master's stage as a close group, downright one organism.
Especially actors who bend to very expressive, sculpture-like group formations in choir sections get their rights bare, only by decorating a white curtain, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures first hydrogen load
The novelty is beginning to show in Europe, especially thanks to a cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at Hanover's IAA commercial vehicle show, Hyundai will supply a thousand batch of cars for use by a Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing a fuel cell truck, Hyundai will continue on the road marked by Nexo and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
With this first project of its kind, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refueling network," Hyundai Motor's vice president In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the agreement.
The fists fluttered several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in and off a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, he was still hit by the abuser.
Police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated as three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
There was also another assault incident in the centre of Kajaani on Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajaan man about 20 years old hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who previously hit him still kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the abusers further away from the victim and police called.
However, the perpetrators had time to leave before the police arrived.
Police ask witnesses of the event to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at an inquiry.kainuu@police.fi.
Long-term radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is over.
The doctor has said it, I live day by day, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you get a little bit of a story on these year rings, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Police only clearly find serious cases and many of the correct violent situations remain unreported.
"Companies do have a duty to record their near misses situation under the Occupational Safety Act but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
In cases of violence, the problem has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violent situation is difficult to pull when aggressive threats of a certain level must also be counted as violence - even if there is no interference.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even though the actual thing doesn't happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the shops were released, there was a pretty big deal in the media about its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At that time, quite a few employers provided security services for at least nighttime hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, due to security, the disruptions remained well held, the impression arose that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff crime, and it is quite understandable that the abused seller does not want to make a request for investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same section of the 2011 law, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is abused, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be charged.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from there to the hard end of the penalty scale would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery store must be open almost day and night in small towns must guarantee the safety of the workers in the store.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Missi's coronation is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but the broadcast is shown by Viafree.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the transmission.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg exclaimed his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The distance races are followed by many previous years of Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg chipped looking towards the Saros.
Most likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siepp with his throw, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about her divorce for the first time in the Evening News weekend paper.
Missikaunotar said she didn't want to open the reasons for the divorce more closely in public, as that's between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry to have a new relationship, but was going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone," Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came to light even later when Sohlberg accidentally erred in calling Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The plot jam laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, right?
Janni Hussi signed for the screw-up.
The Ostrobothnian man tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for numerous crimes against his cohabiting partner for three years in prison.
The crime-making tool included belt, cable and cable ties.
The court confiscated the items in question to the state.
Rank's charge was about a suspect in aggravated rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the district court.
The Kokkola employee was charged with four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of damage.
The crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24 last.
At the end of the last actions, the man was captured and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven by the court.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public report on the verdict.
The district judge said the accused had targeted violence, threat and coercion against his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with tobacco, fed strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By its sentence, the court ordered the state to lose criminal equipment: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife, and veneer.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read from the sentence that a large part of the most outrageous acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women, and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, aches, suffering and temporary harm for a total of 5800 euros.
He hardly has that money, because the convicted person already has debts in the collection.
The prison sentence is not a man's first.
The newspaper does not give the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district sentence is not final when writing this.
Europe in four-point lead to Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional hole game match against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup around Paris with a score of 10-6, while twelve doubles will still be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of four four four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon fours, the winnings were equalized 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games they played as a pair during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved this.
On Sunday, the two seek more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and even Americans have only three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns fierce harassment of supporters in Honka match: 'Violence is not part of football'
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning its supporters' disruptive behaviour in a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to seek to pick a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers could not calm down the situation, but police and also horse police were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team's players and officers are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are strongly saying that any action that endangers the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers investigate factors that threaten safety and eliminate side effects.
Supporter culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support positive, joyful and supportive activities in football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now among the growing group around the world who vows to invent a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he slipped his device at altitudes above seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device evokes positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: The industrial action that will begin tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
The bans on overtime and shift change that will begin tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors will be particularly visible in social and health services and child day care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The impact will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift change due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility for staff not to be hired, but workers have been left working overtime or switched shifts.
This is not yet a industrial action.
It is the norm in terms of occupational safety and health for each employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of dismissal by small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director of the Labour Market for Local Government Employers, will not begin to assess the effects of overtime and shift change bans in advance.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can deteriorate.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so impossibly extensive, social and health and technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experience was already gained in similar activities of the Association of Local and Primary Nurses Super and Social and Health Care, which lasted three days.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL ban on overtime and shift exchanges applies to workers in municipalities, the church, the state, and private social and health care, among other things.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
The industrial action will apply to nearly 100,000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Termination Act continues.
The government should now admit that here we run to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
The thing about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
Great Coral Reef is born with children and adults - the performance circles study ray and seahorse gestures
The Great Coral Reef, the collective in other premises, premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
However, this time a clearer limited presentation is also being built, which refreshes and crystallizes the observations made in the initial exercises.
The theatre game also has enough fairytale magic for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children make in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat similar to the fairytale ballet, fitness circle and nature-related information, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the trajectory of corals and organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
Six different fitness districts learn, among other things, the gestures of a ray and seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour is made, where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef is home to both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being examined.
There are also organisms looking at corals.
The glances and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life-staining.
Whether you are the landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group seeks to reach the limit of thinking and action through their exercises, which is challenging to get to when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitratori will hold a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals.
Destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to understand the significance of one's own practice of compassion in the face of the visions of destruction.
Other spaces have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, whose wonder and play it clears room for.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Children and young people today are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at a younger and younger age all the time.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives for substance abuse and sex, because others say they do that.
I was overwhelmed when a friend told me that he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade at the weekend at the "boyfriend".
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today's children could live a decent childhood and don't have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup in their photos and revealing their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing images in the evening.
It is even harder to guess how old they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am glad that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was able to be a child for many years and didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: Authorities told government that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Security Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that Airiston Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime," Yle reported.
The information from sources that have appeared anonymous was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict not to speculate that there was anything else to do," Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's data, there has been no evidence of a link to national security of the seized material so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there," one of Yle's interviewees says.
The extensive searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is about mere economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, the Iltalehti compiled a story that goes through claims both for and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saved Liverpool's Lost Series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away for a 1-0 guest win.
At that time, the combination of Pep Guardiola sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate their own field end alone.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league cup away win from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Hazard was now, of course, with us from the very beginning of the minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first juggled in a small space with the triangular game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass-through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed a complete left foot pull from there to the lower corner.
Pool brass guard Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and could only get his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's steering from the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Veskari Kepa also got into action.
The Basque Watch reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, with his throw, reset Hazard's drive through.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star's butt was directed towards national teammate David Luiz, who saved the masters' leadership.
It also didn't last in the 89th minute when exchanger Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner of its honor.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the league tip - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship battle with two points behind the tip.
In the clock transfer conversation, the poteros are deep
I remember when a magazine asked different Finnish influencers a few decades ago what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only thing to mind: the Nen ending.
Some people have an nen ending in their last name and some don't.
There can be lines of division anywhere, and here was one bidder.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock shift is being abandoned.
Many people agree that clock-shifting twice a year has been a fool's job and caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide which time to end up: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This is also where people can say their opinions on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday, October 12.
There is a heated discussion at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people's well-being and summer time defend with the effect of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and, consequently, well-being.
Both sides have their strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythms a person's day and gives alertness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the lightness increases people's movement outdoors and gives better opportunities for autumn yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I would rather take both, but bad enough for our location in the northern part of the globe, we can't help it.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical of the debate on the subject is that one's own vision is driven and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The opposing party's arguments are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate because it does not require a great deal of dedication and a mutu feel is enough to justify.
Similar issues are usually the most sharply and equally infertilely debated anyway.
It is a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think it will be adapted.
And always it also offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels down.
Josba fought a narrow away win
Josba's first guest game in Divar produced a full three league points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba picked up compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams were suspended, crucial minutes were played in a tie.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowerful anyway when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds of series.
Next, O2-Jyväskylä will be visited in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th Anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a partly very sad mood.
The arson of the church at risk of acceleration a week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite the municipal and other joints of all the world.
The family mass will begin at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the parish house at the Karelian banquet table.
There are all kinds of things on the show all day, both inside and out.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of the retired Ari Räsänen, who has been a parish master for 37 years.
The church's birth festival also marks the end of an era.
The already decommissioned parish house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in evasive spaces at the former municipal hall, says Markku Koistinen from Kappa.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for that 200 years.
Elon Musk gives way to Tesla government speech director - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he had founded.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Musk, on the other hand, is forced to step down from Tesla's board chairmanship for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk is also subject to stricter control.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, Director of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it demanded that Musk be fined and banned from acting in charge of listed companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went on a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency.
The death toll is expected to increase further, as the damage is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on Sulawesi Island.
A warning was issued immediately after the quake, but was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all known deaths are at least for now from Palta.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
From ruins to requests for help
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged soldiers to continue the rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is still believed to be 50-60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue work, said that one person was excavated from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular with business travelers, at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
Syaug said heavy clearing equipment was quickly needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the application's encryption.
The disruptions were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used at the party convention of the British Conservative Party in government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who is driving Brexit, and former Secretary of State Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the app, the audience was able to access the profiles of politicians in the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The public had access to profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson to a profile picture for a moment to insult a porn picture and title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to the image of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist at The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the loginer can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) is supporting the data breach.
The application was created by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland quiz audience has a large number of applauding Poles every week
The watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland quiz show.
The Wall, a rapidly spreading US format, landed in Finland version Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in the same studio in Poland where other international productions in the format are being made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start period, a studio audience of the program was highlighted on social media, which was bet Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles who might be sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, Head of Domestic Programs at Four, illustrates the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland, and just Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international applauders in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
There are such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences, who go to the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen background.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you don't understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green wall-falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters present in the studio for foreign speakers who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneous interpretation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap they throw there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff in domestic production recently.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's filming in Finland.
He was constantly replaced by simultaneous interpretation and knew everything that was said in Finnish on the set, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon sulking in southern Japan moves towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but officials say major injuries have been avoided and there is no information on the deaths so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and more than 300,000 households have been cut off.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are stagnant in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon in Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also heavy winds and rains.
Train services have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
Weather scientists say Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces became even darker
The first season of the Aces has been bad.
The sky darkened almost black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on their home field to Vaasan Sport on Saturday.
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points for six rounds in total.
No Aces defender or two lower chain player has yet scored.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
The audience was already out of the hall by the time the game was almost half left.
Six games are just played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to worry, because we played that much weakly.
Especially the second round performance was shamefully poor, Jarno Kärki, who made the power for the Ace 1+2, told.
The sport naturally enjoyed winning.
The team had a game below from Friday, so it would have thought it would have been visible in the making.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall stands.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Traktorikynnö SM competitions were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps there would be expectations that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already briskly blocked before 10, sellers reported that the products had run out, nearly 500 servings of news porridge were sold than before, and Hyvärinen heard there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later this afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon could accommodate a particularly large amount of program for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record amount of place.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 rapporteurs, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the hall's stands.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, winner of the rye bread competition, spent the day in the martto pie workshop.
7 x most beautiful lamp - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior, and read the book without fatigue.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting is growing, the more years behind them.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many people face with age as vision accuracy decreases and more and more people suffer glare.
As we get older, the need for light is also growing.
A six-year-old needs three times more light than a 20-year-old.
It is therefore worth investing in the caring effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The popularity has a Japanese style that combines unpretentious, Scandinavianism and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colors, has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as the rest of the home interior.
Materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, more is now being invested in home than before, and interior design has become a way to express itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
It is not necessarily the latest trend lamp, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kokoo showed door to Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of Kokoo and striker Brendan O'Donnell are separated.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three League games in the orange black without power points, Kokoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined Kokoo in August with a one-year contract that included a probationary period until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old striker played for the KHL with Kunlund Red Star and and KHL Farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
Player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out to the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Game specialty player now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-foot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed in packaging from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Pelimies.
As a plastic material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are expected to move to recycled material even in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It is not a big problem to start recycling.
There will be financial savings, for example, when cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimie's operations, as in addition to new products, the company's key product range includes games and equipment used.
Buying every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothing works in a outfit from season to season.
They create a good garderob with their versatility, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knitwear made of natural material with polo collars cannot have an error purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight pants, tulle skirts and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a snotty style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style master.
This is how you create style.
The trend look of the autumn is born of golden brown and wide-legged cordamet pants, black polo knitwear and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit, along with other classics, blue-green Scots screen skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Brings edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casually trendy clothing items: denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence agencies has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence team.
The KGB agents in the West of the Soviet Security Service prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh, an archivist who defected west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established checkpoints from the peninsula to the roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
Cold War agents hid supply kits in the terrain with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication equipment for sabotage groups.
As recently as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, with a trapmine that exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reach four drunk drivers in the province at night
Police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Kontiolahti man blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove two passengers at 9:30 a.m. at the beginning of Kajaanintie.
On Polvijärvi Kuorevaarantie, the car derailed to a ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
He had no serious injuries at the exit.
A 20-year-old outdoor man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into the alcometer.
Police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunk driving and the Polvijärvi driver, in addition, of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man carrying a van in Tuupovaara at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie blew 0.52 per mil.
He's suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting observations of a stabbing at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was assaulted in the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
Dark hair suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jacket immediately after the stabbing left in a dark station in the direction of Ratapihankatu bus station.
One suspect took a bicycle from Humalisto Street in the direction of downtown.
Pedestrian killed after being hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus crashed into him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. on Raumantie, at the site of the meadow.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, HPK sports director at Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in the start-ups, underpower play and the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue in the HPK of Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, underpower play and the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to a player who has experienced this experience," HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola commented in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska will increase when playing ice hockey League solution games.
Riska, a centre attacker from Pietarsaari, has played league hockey in JYP, Lock and Sport before.
The winger Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probationary period.

Real events are also being discussed in this case.
22 years ago, the tallest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could be saved by eye surgery before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and atmospheric pressure, he lost sight, which meant that the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall continued on and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could not find his way back to camp.
When the man was sought, he was found in such poor condition that survival was not believed.
Weathers were left to die.
But miraculously, he still got back on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers were thought to be still dying and once again left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility enough to be given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brol.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today, the 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and to celebrate the anniversary, a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at the Eno Church Hill at 10 a.m. at the family mass, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at the Eno parish house.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Uncle's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire of the Church of the Acceleration Danger has touched many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno Church is now the oldest in the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the Church of Kiihtelysvaara was destroyed by fire.
The wood church in Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was arranged in the morning, where the church destroyed by the fire was silenced and recalled.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed his might in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photos taken from the area show a lot of flooding throughout Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region instead of a street due to flooding.
Another video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, strong winds caused strong seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for monitoring weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to CNN, a 2011 study found that medics only occur once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm that is now blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
There has also been concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
Areas destroyed by wildfires are also hit by the storm in the summer around Athens.
A medican in Greece also raged last November.
We should not go to the sea now, but flights on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on vacation on the Greek islands threatened by autumn storm
Sea trips are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to over 3,500 Finns who are on holiday in Greece via Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions will be needed, as even the hurricane storm Zorbas is predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise to up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
The wretchedness of the weather is increased by heavy rains.
All passengers travelling to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland who have reported their phone number have been warned of high winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
Still sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in solar travel communications, by the early evening, the worst has been avoided in the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety ahead.
Tui media operator Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still peaceful, he said Saturday early in the evening.
The aid currently has a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had also mocked the sun and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen on Sun Trips.
Zorbas is estimated to be the next Turkish nuisance, though slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there in case of that, and checked the number of Finns who flew to Antalya with Tuilla, for example," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvise and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in Miss Final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in a generous evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get dressed on the plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet host in the Miss Finals, and he talks to the front-row stars arriving.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi pondered.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful," Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnered curious looks from pensioners
The host and Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen of 2016 told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet she had enough to do with radio plots and Love Island Finland shoots.
There has been enough rush even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on makeup and put on my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Garfield laughs.
Karvinen says she pulled out her makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she enjoyed her job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as well as being stopped so far.
Karvinen says she went to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are the real feelings of people, Garfield describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I wear overknee boots?
Three Perfect Example Costumes
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that wears a outfit from season to season.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the overknee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
As its name suggests, boots that reach the knee are repeated stylish from year to year and season to season.
The spectacular boots share the opinions of the users, but the bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
The overknee boots are actually suitable for any type of outfit.
Whether it's a farch, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or fake leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look great in both party looks and everyday outfits.
Black overknee boots are well suited for even gentle outfits.
They conveniently balance the femininity of a pink, flower plier skirt and a gentle, plush knit.
Fresh but autumn stylish everyday outfit for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet mesh, overknee boots, spectacular earrings and a staple bag.
Although overknee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday life, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi robot cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring traffic is scheduled to be started in the area by robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically among other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger sitting on board.
Vehicles sense their environment with several different sensors all the time and assess whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, who is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, on Wednesdays from 10-15 and on Thursdays from 10-15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robotic car stops are identified by stop markings.
The surest way to get is from stop number 1.
Mokoma bassist fell off stage in the middle of a gig and injured
Mokoma band informs on their Facebook page about a surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
Mokoma's gig at Pakkahuone, Tampere, took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
The Hämäläinen's wrist was broken.
The band will announce this on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped off Pakkahuone yesterday on stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour is done by backup, the pages say.
Fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist Santtu lies with a plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was a pretty big worry about how bad it went.
The relief is great, fortunately the bones heal over time.
Cheers and speedy recovery for Santu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus the replacement!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but promise to leave out such a strong drama about the ending of gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police oversee hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting control on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police department wilderness contact persons reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting license required on state land.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons and the permitted cartridge volumes of self-loading weapons used in chickenfing were checked.
Police said 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting permit.
Twelve daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers of the vehicle were blown by police, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols handled five traffic violations in fine proceedings, police times.
In conclusion, hunters follow the licensing of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (co.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressed position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group of people coming to Finland than are in the quota, because in practice some are not arriving for various reasons.
On his way, Mykkänen will also meet NGOs operating on the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talked about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has supported the quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500 to 2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit is the first during this government term to be made by the Minister of the Interior to watch the election of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hacks - you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill prohibits, in principle, the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by the decrees of ministries in relation to farm animals, pets or otherwise business.
So everything else is, in principle, prohibited except those specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it probably means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security or good practice of society.
The ban on any activity that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation is now being enacted.
The change causes nothing new to be tried in business, for example, and nothing else is done until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The government's action in the drafting of the law in general has been weak.
If we now take the path that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland that is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act will require an update.
But a legislative project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is prohibited, which is not specifically permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will suspend the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell hints: The Four Trendiest Skirts of Autumn
This autumn's trend garment comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good in skirts.

Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulking sweetly in Jere's arms
In Karalahti's family photo, a sweet three-month-old baby Alexia comes to the focus of attention.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito Daycare Centre established for Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family addition in early July.
The couple's first-born son Jax turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti for coaches in Marbella, Spain, which involved the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted a photo of the Spanish atmosphere on Instagram, where the whole Karalahti family poses.
The children Jax and Alexia are in their parents' arms.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly sulking baby Alexia, resting in the arms of the father Jere.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, generosity and joy of people, writes Nanna Karalahti alongside the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti, who became public from the Fitness Diaries program, and Jere Karalahti, an ex-ice hockey player, recently left for the kindergarten business and opened an Aito daycare centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahtis, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for the breeding side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the kindergarten.
Turkey urges charging mobile phones in case of storm
Storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country on Saturday about the Greek storm, CNN Türk writes.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency officials on Saturday early evening urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functionality of the internet connection so that people can get current status updates, according to the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been told to stay home and away from the windows, and to move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns about the storm Zorba in Greece.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather bulletins and local authorities' instructions.
Not long ago, when I contacted, there the wind was hard and raining.
The people were calm," Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages about Finns in distress.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was told on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was admitted that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard a piece in the Russian GP time.
There is no reason to sink into panic in Ferrari camp, the experienced driver said.
They were just faster than we were, but there is no huge issue.
Our car was the best in timetime all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth driven and with his teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen, who was clearly left at Mercedes speed, said.
Ferrari was having a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkös was asked what the sudden fall from Mercedes' ride was.
They seem to be going faster than we are - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is a constant guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
The time times saw a rare delicacy for the future team Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time trial session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth starting position is best in over three years.
And while in the second driving session, as many as five drivers did not drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early part of the season, the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart night progressed on a steady note.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he couldn't get a decent hit.
Clearly more extensive Helenius controls the match with his tough leagues, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home crowd did not even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere and his opponent created by the audience.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup game," Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
The loss might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is no younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Number of victims of Indonesia disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president calls for a clear rise in the death toll.
The country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas on Sulawesi Island: the port city of Palu and its neighboring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palta, there is no clarity about the situation in Donggala yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as in the disaster area, electricity and telecommunications connections are across in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused laughter
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected in Billnäs Ruukki.
In the interview round, each Miss finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of a glass bowl on stage.
Especially finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitant response caused sweet but benevolent laughs in the audience present.
The question asked to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before hesitantly began.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I have read is..., Anttikoski said, thinking.
The reflection break caused a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics someone, Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a round of applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Previously, on the Miss Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, as she did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will be relinquished.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from behind, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, even though quite a few people think that pear tree is already growing.
This cake can also be made only from apples if you do not want to buy the pear.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake is also invested in its pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt butter in a pot.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam, and then add corn flour to the foam as well as melt butter.
Combine corn starch, or maizena and baking powder, and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan, and apply pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half the dough on top of pear slices and apple blocks on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple lobes.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in the pan and then undo the serving platter.
Cut the cake only when properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbs easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour that do not contain gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January
Kuusamo Ruka will host an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature for the first time in January.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other programme numbers on literary topics, as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include the Swedish detective literature star Jens Lapidus and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist behind the title of Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature writer guests from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analyzed the issue have outlined two types of "coolity" of slightly different features: generally attractive coolness and the opposing dissident-coolity.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers' description, had many features considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, amicable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and cared little about the reviews of outsiders.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hard in the long run is not cool: high status in teens may not lead to success later in life.
This is what a 2014 American study published in Child Development says.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good-looking groups, and sought the popularity of others, had an increased risk of using drugs and getting into crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than their previously unobtrusive peers.
High status lock trucks, badge bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a regular supermarket shirt than with those wearing a brand shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a badge shirt in the event of a visit.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, beware!
It's about to be hit by a hurricane - weather warning screams red
During the weekend, as much water can rain in southern Greece as it rains in Finland over an average of six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the ambassador, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the Foreca blog.
It says the hardest gusts in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland early in the week, blew at its highest over 31 metres per second.
However, the blog says that the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can come in southern Greece.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men's drooled Love Island Finland?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in Love Island Finland, the beauty Anku drooled by several men also appears as a craft aunt with strange Youtube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises crafters, among other things, to make an octopus from an old sheet paper roll.
Anku also shows in its sympathetic style how to make a hedgehog from tights, which grows the right spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grasses grow, but let's do it in a bit surprising way, Anku hints and presents sawdust, tights and the seeds of the grass he makes the hedgehog.

Valtteri Bottas shook and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more minutes after his Russian GP pole position drive while he was in front of the media.
The great round left behind Mercedes' first star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly mentally important to the Finnish driver who raised criticism this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of a solution round.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas explained.
I have only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got some good tours again.
It is not easy to skip the Sochi track, so the start is particularly important.
And of course Bottas was allowed to answer the question of whether he would drive tomorrow for the victory or whether the World Cup title is ahead of the approaching Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is that I am trying to win.
There can be no other goal when you leave the pole, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we fight for both masters.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vetel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, however, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas' success after the drive, and Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff was also seen.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtteri, but he failed to make a seven.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was bursting out of his ears," Wolff said.
The question of whether the stables will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly," Wolff replied, dodging.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, and see how the race goes.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, competing at Honda Civic, started the Turku section with moderation because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give a handicap when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
It was a bit blind to the third one.
In a situation like that, you don't want to go crazy.
On Saturday, Jussi Tepo, who was the second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Secretary of State Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the war that has been going on for seven years.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria is planned for October, which would be attended by the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassing him, brought an exceptionally large number of people to the screens.
In the United States, a full-time Supreme Court judge's nomination drama brought at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, then appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor accusing him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more were followed by the online consultation.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported setting its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure will rise to over 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewer figures come from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final figures on Monday, but they are dizzy anyway.
Few reach 20 million
Over 20 million ratings are usually only accessible in the United States by sports matches and the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The most watched show in the United States, the American Football League NFL Final Game for the Super Bowl is certainly a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by a total of nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million people in the inauguration.
A matter of top importance
The Supreme Court's appointment of justice is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called scale language on several questions, whose voice could determine the position of the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, ruled that same-sex people were granted the right to marriage throughout the federal government.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in terms of its positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court in conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information for parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Originally, of course, the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was made to the situation in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazingly long time to correct.
Now the correction is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a through-call.
After that, with the layman's understanding, it's about pressing a button: now that the wire is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show their information to their parents - if he or she has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is paid, and a 10-year-old does not even get bank codes.
So, practically no one can see the knowledge of a primary school fourth grader except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a matter of parental justice as it is about the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, from which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to beat up allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh
US media say the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The report must not last more than a week.
The Washington Post said it was a more limited investigation and may not become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The caught brawler continued to bulge even at the chamber.
Police say they put the man in police prison to "calculate".
Police were threatened by a suspected abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities report on the incident that began when a man of over 30-vutia severely sued a dispute at a downtown restaurant.
He first assaulted another client within the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When a third party tried to intervene, he still hit him too.
The triple abuse led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they sent the man to a police prison to "calculate".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at UNICEF Finland.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawesi, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they need shelter - at first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are most often able to be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported at first time, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and connecting families is one part of UNICEF's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously raised will be used for emergency assistance.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already begun a fundraising to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk to end Tesla as chairman of board - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his position as chairman of the board of directors of the electric car company Tesla and agree to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement he signed with the U.S. Securities Market Enforcement Authority.
By agreeing Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud due to tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to pull the electric car company Tesla off the stock exchange, which caused the company's stock price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as Tesla's Chairman of the Board of Directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and take two "independent leaders" into its management team.
Tesla also needs to set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fines, Tesla will also have to pay $20 million in similar fines to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misled investors
The SEC said Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billionaire tweets say the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla's stock price rose by more than ten percent in a day after tweets, but later fell.
The SEC said Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
The supervisor said he had not really negotiated the funding he claimed.
He also had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with another management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14% when the SEC reported a fraud charge.
The agreement on the news is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The Last Judgment Is Not a Reason
The bells of the cathedral do not, of course, ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical fault.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point at 12 o'clock.
It's like a mediocre horror movie: even when the church crypt would hear exorcism and the organ would play to themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reason: it has broken.
It has been seen by a repairman, but some part has broken and a new part is expected to do so," says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says that church bells don't ring due to a fault.
