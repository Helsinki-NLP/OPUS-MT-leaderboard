Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she's making art on the subject - "A person should have a right to their own body"
Dozens of patient reports hang from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts Project room gallery.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal treatment history so that the violence in the process would become visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a period of years of study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process begins with a referral to diagnostic studies of "gender identity disorder", which are being conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used estrogen he ordered via the internet and was very far along in his own repair process anyway.
She felt like she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the correction process in order to also legally correct the gender.
Translaki, or law on the strengthening of transgender sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilization in order to get the right gender to, for example, a population register center and passport.
Currently, each gender correction is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive incapacity.
A person has the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the translaw has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect sovereignty.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
Elections came and the Finns Party entered the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
It is a matter of domestic policy disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International's Finnish branch.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of packaging and instructions for use of the drugs Auer uses.
In the Patient Story installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a story based on these that would define Auer's right to care and help.
The sense of the reality being studied appears exposed to wavering.
The subject's perception of self appears fragmented in a boundary-level way and the unstable traits associated with personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted sex reassignment treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
Then on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpol waiting hall into the TV.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was born on that television, in which Auer reflects on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but breast removal needs a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel other than the number of genders defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is harder for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Dozens of people who are going through it meet, for whom one must justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who seek the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On the basis of these, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to write the feelings that had existed since childhood and teens.
Why the wide chin didn't seem to fit your own body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer feels he is already seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts most is when loved ones abuse.
"They should know and they know who I am but they won't or can't internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, there can be no official confirmation of its own gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in terms of legal gender.
An adult applicant makes a written application for a new personal identity code, stating in it that he or she feels of another gender.
After a six-month reflection period, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and Auer's exhibition is also crystallized in this requirement.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, an African-American civil rights organization, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP Travel Bulletin for Missouri will come into force on August 28, 2017, and calls on African-American tourists, visitors, and locals to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where numerous questionable racial events have recently occurred," the organization said in a statement.
A recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to export discrimination cases to court, and the enforcement of state laws disproportionately affects minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri chairman Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time before."
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization's first warning to the U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students as examples at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by Missouri police even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be on guard and warn their families, friends, and coworkers about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to prepare, for example, by including money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, the sixteenth highest number of U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which defends the civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws obliging police to arrest people for immigration violations, which the organization says this will increase racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually published by the State Department and apply to other states, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä (center) Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for State Ownership Guidance has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is in conflict with the state's will, according to the Minister.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would waive supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on ownership guidance.
Sanctions immediately hardened speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in connection with the G20 in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted bitterly in Russia.
The most striking response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said the sanctions law signed by Trump meant "a full-scale trade war."
Even if Russian reactions only acknowledge as exacerbations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passing of the Sanctions Act on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Congress passed the law with considerable consensus, but it was said that the adoption of the law was much more difficult for the president.
Trump criticized the law he signed recently as "significantly incomplete."
President Trump's sprainyness may have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting his own powers must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation into the United States, both of Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's links with Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As White House staff have changed frequently and various scandalous twists have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being done in the United States under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a chimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the core region of the Union in the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that trades a lot with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas lng, for example, important to the US economy.
Trade sanctions are a means of world politics as a means of showing disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and attentive.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Liberty
Addressing statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologists in the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word practice about the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue, and especially the addition of Emma Lazarus' poem from the statue's pedestal in 1903 — 17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller said, "I don't want to go into history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom illuminating the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just a matter of history, as he himself said.
The essentials are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of its kind, where the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tireed, your poor, / Your huddled masses years to breast free, / The written response of your doing shore."
The poem is more topical than ever.
Miller was by no means practicing literary criticism, making it clear that the "poor of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal after his death, and they knew very well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the connections between French and American republicanism by classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiles.
The incorporation of the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to its original.
Rush Limbaugh — a mouthman who can now be considered some kind of omen of Trump — claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not call anyone, but is an early forerunner of neoconservatives that will take the United States to a world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty will step forward.
He takes the freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not lead the way but incites the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the executive director of the British Athletics Federation, says the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Black said there was "something special happening" in Scotland that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it long enough to understand what's going on," Black says.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes it is related to the union's activities,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And the average streetman thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something absolutely amazing, whatever it is."
Many Scottish athletes compete seriously in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000 metres.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly stunning," Black says.
"The athletes left the opportunity proudly of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidhi's words had a genuine sense and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in the 400-meter fence race, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "incredible" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven for 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London for the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and it is also worth keeping an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes wins in the UK World Cup Qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scots on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "hugely proud" to have so many Scots involved, some of which are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
"It's a great honor to become a captain anyway, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am very proud of all the Scots that made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for award positions.
My Captain's speech?
I thought it went all right.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be insanely stunning."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and silent as sheep to slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their presenters.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also understated online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best reviews of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hotheads.
He has run the state firmly and adhered to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of his baldness in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax funds.
Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of moderation of comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users Hogan blocked on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and factual.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked the question of hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments from the Washington Post.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack." Someone else might call them to promote what is considered important.
In Facebook's era, it is easy to manage communication by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It is really the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment of the United States Constitution to block a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation went to discuss with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin on Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington's time, low-cost postage had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in the newspapers barking at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the US-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as shown in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about twenty places, and there are also online announcements from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also from individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu Evira.
Green finches have died of a great deal called trichomonosis.
It is caused by an protozoa from a scientific name Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially of them, pigeons.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be detected in finches.
In 2009, it was really busy.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch stock, after which the species' populations have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of the Central Museum of Natural History (Luomus) at the University of Helsinki.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field benefit for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Senior Open in Scotland.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament next door to Archerfield Links last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of the new location and serves as the tournament ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will get to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at their best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador for the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field."
Eales, an Englishman, defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player living in Southport says.
"I couldn't defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil, and he went on tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played quite strongly.
I am happy with my game so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Possible indoor air problems of the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade communications company, at least so far, the brigade reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies are still ongoing.
The investigation began when the man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had weakened the barracks due to poor indoor air.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case and other servants in that unit have not had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
It is not known at the moment that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that due to the July arrival batch, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have allowed dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of that, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
Bardina Degei does not use stove in cooking.
He rarely uses the boiler.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a sweet potato — locally "note" — directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned to the car is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture, he sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as washing in cloudy water retrieved from a nearby swamp.
The post of toilet is delivered by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares walk in the village after 5:00 in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annex was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village detention was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its hatred to the Jakarta government, which keeps the area under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and bleak. The journey there begins with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive to the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated tin roofs rust have dyed yellowish brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries came to Papua, the Mee Pago tribesmen worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have occurred.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. She means colorful, hand-woven wrapt headgear, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"Before, we only had leaves as a blanket of our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is an highland area about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine generated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion tree reserves.
However, for the Papuars, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 beans since 1969 and raped, tortured and captured thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s took on genocide proportions.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in peaceful protests in the area.
Brisbane Archdiocese report We Will Lose Everything 2016 contains reports of previous year's atrocities such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means — and relentless attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases weekly," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move to the region in hopes of a better livelihood.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable essaying in peanut sauce.
Locals find it difficult to compete.
"Changers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo — nicknamed Jokowi — promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced some kind of trough just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and Witnesses, drunken soldiers captured the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, Yulianus Yeimo, aged 16, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About 1,000 beans —young men and women, as well as children — gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for ceremonies with them, and began performing the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, where you dance in a ring and imitate bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the mood got hot, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: "If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been published to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of the Kego Koto area, suspected the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"There were several shots fired in the population."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME magazine sad. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that police only "protected" the police station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like it will ever happen again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to cancel his speeches.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of Paniai victims view the allegations with a gloomy disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says he had been abused by soldiers after he helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after burying the victims," he says.
The shootings are not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighboring area of Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the manager refused to take the man who had lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospitalization was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in water while fishing on a nearby river.
The angry villagers demonstrated at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, locals say the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified, afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the police officers who fired the shots to be held accountable and the removal of a mobile police unit from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live in the lush middle highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that claims to defend the rights of the beans by random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that is too expensive for locals,
As well as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihood of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthy migrants than locals.
Few beans have enough capital and expertise to run their own companies competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is given little attention around the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, despite being granted a rare filming license, the official reason being the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces in Papua and West Papua face new risks: refusing a visa and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of action of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numerous and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting scene.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence for human rights violations."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the beans say they are no longer likely to vote for Yokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, virtually without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panians, like the other Beans, consider the votes they have given to Jokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again demonstrated resistance metaphorically: they buried one of the victims in the opposite land of the police station and military office.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora barks at Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even their own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at Hartwall Arena.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora rolls the reason for flopping the rematch completely on Helenius.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match has been postponed to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match since.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I needed surgery, Chisora says.
The British say it is currently in about 45% condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but is aimed at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with a split voice.
Fire takes over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames captured one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee a 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was the second fire within two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured, and there was no idea of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue officials said the fire was able to extinguish the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may re-raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building board commissioned a study that found that the plates used for facade cladding and insulation suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and cladding plates could contribute to the rapid progress of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
Police are requesting sightings of the moped or its theft by email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, according to survey
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said they had only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey and was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7% were generation Y representatives and less than 15% belonged to Generation X.
The rules were most commonly violated by taking food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three percent admitted to deliberately taking blade-equipped items onto the aircraft, and 2.2% of women and 3.7 percent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs onto the aircraft.
The survey was conducted by passengers from all over the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken smuggling goods past security and how many had done so consciously.
Not surprisingly, the most travelers are also most likely to take smuggling goods past security — knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey states, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the aircraft and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the confiscations of the TSA are liquids.
For a while, there was also the belief that books should not be taken on the plane.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay Obama's term decisions to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA Director Scott Pruitt, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's administration to reduce smog emissions.
Pruitt said the change shows that the agency he led is taking better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers in the states.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the action against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeals.
The states should start complying with the 2015 ground ozone requirements as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of decisions by one year to give his agency more time to become familiar with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to mitigate regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA director exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the execution of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his turnaround with ozone regulations only strengthens EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to sue it to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt can continue to use its "authority to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, New York State Attorney General, who was suing the EPA this week, said the group was planning to continue the pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog thus generated can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people, and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups that pursue their own interests."
Supercar manufacturer becoming SUV - "occurs in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari style," Sergio Marchionne, CEO Sergio Marchionne, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of measles in East Savo of the same virus type
The measles infection in the Rantasalmi is of the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, THL reports.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same strain as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed by a beach salmian person on Friday 28 July is of the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good, because that means we haven't seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that after the fifth sufferer, new infections may continue to emerge until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, a physician responsible for infectious diseases in Soster's primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions have been revealed since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-dateness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä reminds.

Finland prepares for permissible scream
Pontika soup was not even considered legalized.
The underlying argument that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, again by distilling the moonshine.
The basis behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
There has been no political will to enact pontika soup as a right for everyman, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the moonshine was not considered legalized.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, says MP Outi Mäkelä (co.).
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
You can't even grant permission to distill at the home of the moonshine in the future.
Commercial manufacturing also remains subject to authorisation.
Tuominen tells us that there is a simple rule for home brewing alcoholic beverages: alcohol may be made by fermentation at home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make screaming at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavors and aromas and allows the production of the scream, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation still needs to be done so that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings generated at fermentation are clearly noticeable in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be made as much as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
Making a scream is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by Parliament as soon as the autumn period begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the House has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for suspected heart attack.
Pistorius has already been released from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, accompanied by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to hospital for investigation.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Littering phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public talk about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a lettering of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during the call, a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is "ridiculous", "sad" and "stupid." Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugee settlement in the United States.
Trump hung up by telling Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-lave racist lynching in hopes of justice
The Ford Mercury branded car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men block the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of the group, a middle-aged man dressed in striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and takes a deep breath through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man snaps.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-stage that aired on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-stage the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with the murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested in these years — even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the rear-loading arrangements.
"It is a disgrace to history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-lapping is a startling call to action, and it also reminds Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to go to court, and we want things to finally be finished, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but most of all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received from NBC news, more than 50 men were suspected of lynching from Monroe and surrounding counties.
No one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives for lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by a decision of the state of Georgia, and elections were held in the summer.
The FBI said there was an incident around the election in which black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently affected Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a baby for her.
According to FBI reports, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voting murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-lapping of the Georgian massacre for nearly a decade.
The show is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe have already disappeared from today's United States.
It is hard to watch the show but even harder not to look at what Greene says is the intention.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't establish a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year's performance rehearsals began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader in the re-launch for years, but the role is always equally difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also displayed so that it never happens again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I said get off my land, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then the punch goes.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally find too fast?" he asks.
"No," Greene cuddles.
"I just don't think whites used the word n--u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you'll have to use a longer version."
The subject of the show is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the show, and they want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene starts over.
Now Rascona's words are squeaking.
Nobody laughs.
The re-stage ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral kiss stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few tens of meters away, some fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half are white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a show about Ithaca in New York State, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have become true of the story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat at artificial blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the lynchers take off their capes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"It's okay," the woman involved in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for a dinner together.
The white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings that the performance evokes.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch the horrible things they say and do people who look like you — just because they look like you," he says.
"I'm the show made me realize that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
Across the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year's performance.
"Restage is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
How to rip vegetables in stores: This is how much the removal of "extra parts" actually saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
And to take the big hat part off the pineapple - it weighs a lot of money?
The answers strongly divide the opinions: for one it is a sign of the extremely taken snuff, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go to the trash can at home.
This phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, cardboard boxes are found in the vegetables department of Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki, because many people tear off, for example, cauliflower leaf parts.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste in the store.
According to news published by financial reports, snooping at the vegetable counter puzzles traders.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is the way to snoop?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take away the leaves or stumps.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower costing 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing 2.30 euros dropped to 1.95 euros when its stock was twisted away.
Latva artichoke: The price of 2.60 euros was 2.40 euros when the short stock was cut off.
Delicacy mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without positions, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without a stock 80 cents.
The result: If you go to pluck leaves and strains off, you save a few dozen cents for one vegetable at best.
When considered as percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
These purchases would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
The huge transfer amount of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros from French Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league held back the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar representatives' first payment attempt.
Under the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home audience in the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA examines the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association UEFA so that the union could determine any disciplinary action that may result from the incident.
Spanish league president Javier Tebas has suspected PSG is violating UEFA's financial fair play rules with his spending.
UEFA can punish a club that makes a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period.
UEFA says Neymar's move does not automatically break its financial provisions.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts, UEFA was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered violent burns from lightning strike, flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work procedures for an airplane at Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly lightning struck a plane from the rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane into Dunn's ground near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive," Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to an airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business by cutting dividends
The British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it started a new restructuring program in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third savings program to revive the weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell his share of Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for this year unchanged. Its turnover increased by one percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, who said a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others wounded.
NATO said five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
Unconfirmed local reports indicate that three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabaghi region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat in a mosque.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked by a "self-made explosive device carried by a person".
The statement said that all injured were in stable condition and were treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the Taliban's strengthening and the presence of ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where Shia Muslims live mainly.
The Taliban said it was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bombing in central Kabul, the country's most devastating militant faction after US-led forces overthrown the Taliban in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local military and police.
Correspondents said the suicide attacks of recent weeks in Kabul have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA reverses decision to postpone implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during Obama's administration to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone definitions" in 2015 late Wednesday, which said the decision was a testament to its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt, Director, said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations by one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, the smog rate will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to postpone execution.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate environmental regulations during Barack Obama's time, and Trump said the measures were part of a broader economic growth program.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
A person of ISIS' leading figures had also sent building blocks to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
Suspects were said the bomb was scheduled to be taken on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security check.
Police do not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, a public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes decreased, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made good results in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, operating profit for renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Loochenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Loochenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future series of less than 66.7 kg, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the corridor to greet Lomanko, the WBO upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won the showtime by a unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday. Since then, Garcia and Lomanko have been among the top five on the list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How you doing, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven Saturdays.
When the two posed for photographers, Loochenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between the men would be "perfect for sizes".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved the series higher [63.5 pounds] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He's got to get into a lightweight [61.2 pounds], then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachen agreed.
"boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the light series Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing that she was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'm fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Loochenko as an "incredible fighter" and might be going to see Saturday's match.
Loochenko interrupted Garcia's fjord praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said she focused on showing impact force first and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them was wanted to happen more and more strongly.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average salary 5,300 euros, education what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
The last time Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
Rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter early next year.
The tightening will be based on the new MiFIF Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications to a company called APV Investment Degrees Ltd, whose degree working group is equipped with experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry actors alike.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, a provider of business development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The learning material for the degrees includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment degrees Oy, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly about 70.
Of the personnel of the largest banks, roughly all those providing investment services have completed either an APV1 or APV2 degree, as they are mandatory under the companies' own rules.
Then there are smaller banker companies without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided taking degrees, Savikko says.
He said there are "a few" such banker movements.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people since 2000, and approximately 3,000 APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors.
Some bankers consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
More other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation for the financial sector requires APV degrees to be completed, because it is then the expertise related to the investment sector that is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly payers are about 5,300 euros.
Men working in duties earn an average of over 5,900 euros per month and women earn over 4,500 euros respectively.
The tenth of those who earn the most earner earns an average of around 8,100 euros.
The tenth of men who earn the most earn earns over 9,000 euros per month or more, one tenth of the women who earn the most earn earn earn 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been trusted at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, the audit it carried out met individual cases where the professionalism and competence of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the activities of the advisor.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if the professionalism and competence are at a low level.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free in this regard.
More other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II Directive.
It requires that each firm is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, is likely to be empowered to determine what to know.
Fiva's market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current is the regulation on the requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a firm.
The Court says that according to a government proposal from the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably be empowered to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in this autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and continuing training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty of proof of this that this has also been done.
The Court specifies that in practice the company must, for example, map out the staff's job descriptions on an individual level.
This will certainly come with different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced in the deadline if the competence or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person meeting the criteria for a certain time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will tighten in early 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drawn" giant aircraft on top of the United States
The route flown by the aircraft was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday by 787 Dreamliner, which was used by Boeing to test the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The plane, which left Seattle, flew a distance of 15,700 km in 18 hours and 1 minute, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. borders throughout the journey.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming schoolchildren are not bothered by rain or sun roast - Iines Kaikkonen polski persistently with the help of a swimming toilet village
Iines Kaikkonen was moving at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Slurry and Lempuka this week and next week.
Although it rains sometimes and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not a mess, praises the swimming school leader Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children will increase their swimming skills, next week a dozen.
The number of children for the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskari are already starting then, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unifying project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the Sludge beach had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimming schoolchildren trained to stay afloat with swimming toilets, someone even without it.
The smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first thought to go deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged her to pedal towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the slurry beach is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming with the swimming toilet was persistently practiced with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be happy with today's achievements, the swimming teacher praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to water wars again sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swim from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learning swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school students packed up on the pier.
The boys had enough to do with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked fruit, and bask the day.
In the water, the lesson continued, but there was no rush on the pier.
The kind of thing you don't belong in the summer.
Unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a unifying story"
You see all kinds of it.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
So, dishbrushes and laundry racks and "toilet brush with a border brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and marketing of the film that will premiere in these autumn.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been ridiculed on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Blue Product, say?
We are the film's collaborator.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
He says that the products will be specialized in stores, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is a combining story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already reached perata Suomen Kuvalehti's blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film to premiere, so there is still a follow-up.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example, Valio, Refinator, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers' age tests announced
The latest results of medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been announced. The results of the tests carried out using the new evaluation method reveal that over 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far commissioned 6,880 tests, and the forensics agency has now announced the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
80% of those tested, or 2002, an asylum seeker were determined to be over 18 years of age, and the forensics agency determined in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18 years of age".
Tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Forensics Agency says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent, and there are no major differences in the statistics of previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of the 581 tests and announced that there were 442 cases "indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it became apparent that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has contracted puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't really determine age, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon turn 18, and then the risk will be about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
The five over par result in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 sections down on a result strip in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left place on Saturday, but was found to split 41 at the end of the tour.
Ilonen accumulated one double bog in a difficult weather with three bogs.
Others had a hard time too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to split the top spot on a one-under par round, although he said there was enough work to do with the umbrella holding.
The weather was raw, but I hung along and finally the day was good.
He shares the top spot with his compatriots Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to change party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience burst into a lively applause.
"Tomorrow, a registered Republican Party member," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. Forbes says he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather build obstacles than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Flashes sown damage - Thursday becoming even the toughest thunder day of summer
By the end of the week, more thunders will also be added to Southern Finland.
Over the past week, it has been thundering especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be the toughest thunder day of summer to date.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, lightning has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At the table, lightning struck the power center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue services received a report of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in a sauna space at the end of a terraced house.
The rescue services demolished the roof and wall to find fire colonies and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
At Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning set the outbuilding in flames on Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue services arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a detached house again.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashy lightning strike.
Rescue services visited the scene to check the incident, but this time lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the fault was received between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunder-ravaged section of the track.
The lightnings have wreaked havoc across Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been completely insane! estimates meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on call from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of summer, it also feels strong for many.
This might seem really hard thunder, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thunders, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the land lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the toughest thunder day of summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 land lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues until the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunder year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000 pieces.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something to be caught so that this year does not break the "record" two years ago.
However, Ukkoskirin can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a birth environment conducive to thunders.
The main focus of the thunders is likely to move south on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country, where days of about 2,000 lightning can be obtained both Saturday and Sunday.
A more united rain front is expected to be in the middle of the country.
In such things, according to Tuovinen, thunders only sparsely.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology for doping scandal
World athletic boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made over the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics leader Dmitri Shljahtiin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were stripped of the gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
"I think his response today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded performance," IAAF chairman Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" that Russia accepted the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We will have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The testing remains inadequate and the coaches who were banned from operating are still operating freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with Tom of Finland film's poor success
Tom of Finland did not become the success the authors hoped for, says Yle.
If you honestly say, I am disappointed, confesses that the film produced Helsinki Film in an interview with Annika Sucksdorff Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that's what it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
There was no lottery win, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in their home country, they would have already had their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The regulations restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player transfer ever.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play financial rules in 2011, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million to end the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects to Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its star guard, as the club is funded by Qatar's oil-enriched dynasty.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums to acquire players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the business related to football is not loss-making.
The Fair Game Economic Rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, a Frenchman elected as UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play's financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of Fair Play's financial rules will last until 2018, during which clubs will be allowed to make a maximum of €30 million losses.
Although Platini was forced to leave the position of UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will apply them in the future as well," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play's financial rules at UEFA, told Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it may amortize the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on Fair Play's financial rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies related to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count the aid as actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that support from the Qatari Tourism Authority for PSG was oversized.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's merits at PSG might be funded by payments from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar would be making an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA is following even more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources from the situation said Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last period's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of the world's best player, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the operations of the football club, which is owned by the American sports tycoon.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football operating environment over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns the football team.
Compliance with the economic rules of fair play becomes very difficult. There are so many interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now in a hurry: Finnish World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-bladder Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä will be competing on Saturday in the three-trap qualification.
However, the two coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, have not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British Grand Broadcast without success.
The coach has the invitation of the World Cup organizers as a document, but that has not been eligible for a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what," said Jorma Kemppainen, the coach director.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the stadium with the steps in place, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
World Cup Medal for Finland from London calls for a miracle
The World Athletics Championships will begin in London today on Friday and last a week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes are passionate about year after year, whether success comes or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value competition to another, where the acquisition of experience matures the athlete's performance to the level that the adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, nor do there are any veterans.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to watch the games, although London medals are not solved until late at night due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Uscalians are waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki now, although the other is told by his and other throwers' recent results and Pitkämäki's stay in the qualifying last summer's championships.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the games, getting to the final or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics for the coming years will be given a good success in the international championships for young people this summer as well.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as a race between Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the deterrent of terrorism or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place in Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried the caballerial 1080 with his last jump for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and it's a good feeling now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite.
I will try it again in the games from now on, thought Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship stuck in port in Helsinki
Viking's new express ship FSTR is very late for the schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki in Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was a loading on board at 8 a.m.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving a little, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to get on board in the port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical failure on the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for boarding their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical failure.
It was repaired in the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be delayed for Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.

At the point of Mälkkiä, the transport proceeds along Route 13 to Mustola Harbour.
Small Circuit Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously yearns both the characters' 80s glory days and the grunge of the 90s (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time — 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memoir we have stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems outdated.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it was reported, among other things, the backstory of a vegetable can speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching adulthood, and highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys 90s stalker movies, such as the horror film Hand that swings.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still has not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-old Michael Showalter) with George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best is the side paths.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a beard follicle under the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch", from Singles. Andy, played by Rudd, is starting to be an old man.
Moments of random madness may bring this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the spirit of The Americans' Cold War, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series' wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring as the tough-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubaned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there is not much else.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policemen spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a group of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught imitating clumsy socialist drama - for example, there is a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That's why the show often really starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and lobby with two fat men devouring hamburgers.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as well.
Toni Tauru from Kouvola will be in the ring in Macau on Saturday - up against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru receives a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, still fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also wears the black belt of jujutsu and the World Championship of the sport.
For once, I fight myself against an older one.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru says.
The Kouvolalainen was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were received on a quick schedule for the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time was reached for the struggle.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
Fitness can get worse if you are practicing too much now.
In a few of his previous struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in the vertical struggle.
This time it is different.
Issaa from Kouvola describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come on hard in the first round and try to take him to the carpet.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match of Kouvola did not go as planned.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get a hit.
When I went to pour, he hit my eye.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise more frequently into the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three games last year.
Now we are facing the second struggle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
I have been training and been in good shape all along in recent years.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard of the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good training when there was a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvolalainen will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice vertical match.
The main tactic of a 32-year-old is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll go and take the property myself.
Down exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who had fought in China before.
I hear it's Las Vegas, China.
I think there's a big and nice evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been impotent and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the bank shifted interest rates due to increasing pressure on family income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and warned that household income levels are under increasing pressure, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank said interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation boosted by Brexit, and the bank announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide affordable funding to banks £15 million more, or a total of 115 million, through the programme.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the forecast of the Commission for Financial Policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years as households' real income declines consumption."
As far as interest rates are concerned, the Bank reiterated the need for "some tightening of monetary policy" market expectations "a little more broadly" to curb inflation.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted a growth of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7 percent for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5% to $1.31, which weakened by 0.4 per cent compared to the euro to 1.11 euros.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth rates dampened increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households with accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the bank said the situation would deteriorate even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a decline in income in the next few years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after a shock of the EU referendum result, which plunged the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin to show in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, interest rates had begun to be demanded more and more loudly as inflation tightened pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said the excess of its 2% target level was due to a "whole" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be intensifying further as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, Coreco Mortgage Brokers' director.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are becoming more popular, have low interest rates and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
Starting in September, patients may be prescribed a "reverse" HIV inhibitor. The Supreme Court closed a dispute over the financing of the drug in the English Public Health Care System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. The drug taken before sexual intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeals upheld the Supreme Court's sentence last year, which states that the NHS will be able to pay for PrEP, although it claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the English NHS, called Thursday the announced decision a "significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it as "decisating for an important moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive enrollments for the experiment, which will expand in October to other clinics. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreP) is an HIV medicine taken prior to sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
The drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, and people with an HIV positive partner who is not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics select eligible applicants for the experiment from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general practitioner care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the English NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation of treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It is yet another remarkable achievement in the battle that has been going on for over 30 years in solving one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted at those in need and at risk, it could have a revolutionary impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one at risk is excluded from it," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PraEP experiment is a welcome event that was unnecessarily prolonged by several months due to the government's slowing down," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a transformative effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, thus protecting those exposed to HIV and getting one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior design solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was enthusiastic about real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her gear and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to the apartment show here and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it right away and made an offer the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a one-room apartment where only the kitchen could enter the bedroom, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill, Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space of rooms nearly four metres high and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer that could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that they do not have to be crouched.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on and under them."
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms in the space with fascinating details.
On the interlayer, a copper-crossed window of Retrouvius opens to a stylish lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the actual one.
A mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirror-surfaced furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says of the steel reinforced veneer-surfaced MDF door.
"It's balanced, meaning it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With the design of sensible space and storage space, Joanne received 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
"When selling a home, the area determines — or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"In a basic case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond with the apartment is partly created based on them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to the electrical wires that run on the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and additional square meters can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of outfit hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented in Båstad, Sweden, for the last time before her birth.

Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event where Sofia represents before her birth.
His due date is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden, on a representative trip this week.

He's raising us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Market, selling Thai food.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
In the booth, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at the time.
Since the people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Lahti residents to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the countries, he said.
I got hooked on the lak.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places are limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Slowly we got to know each other better and became friends.
Eventually, I sat by a plate with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move because they said self-made spice pastes smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we jurotters are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we have to shyly ask guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows her clients.
He is told where he has been and who has been seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
She remembers what a man I went to eat with my first spring rolls.
He remembers me skinny and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and change things with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste but also our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's been having a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's hardworking.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the fulfillment of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this remarkable day went by, at work.
Discovery of underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
Early in the year, security authorities received a significant list for counter-terrorism work.
The list contains information from more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 people in total and the document contains not only their personal data but also images of each.
More than 130 of the people listed on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening news told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have become more accurate.
The newspaper said Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorists' personal information and images while investigating the underground base of a terrorist organization in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person's home country.
The list also specifies terrorist specialties.
For example, in the 27-year-old Sami J. on the list, the battle name Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, first traveling to Egypt, then Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
His picture next to him is written as a speciality by a suicide bomber.
There is no further information about the man's fate.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe for ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man sinks below surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue services, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person who was underwater was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, fire chief on call from the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him beneath the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue services received a report after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says he was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estlander commends the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The people present also guided the divers excellently.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided with nine people in Eura cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, says the on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around 4:00 in the day.
The crash occurred when one car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says the on-call fire master.
According to the rescue services, there is a speed limit of 80 km/h in the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million for real estate assets
Two brothers argue over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million, which is linked to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak Value Area just three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy over the breakup.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to a contract with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the family's carrying force and central figure".
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was heard for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says the claim is not true, and he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavites that he would like to reach a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of fake statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy stores in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family to buy a property in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first denim store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the final years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to his sons amicably.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business, and Colin said Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said Luke and Mark were "bittered by the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League club and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded, and he told me in his text message that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's being heard in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be decided in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump's media use and news tracking so that the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with management staff on his first day at work, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information, both printed and heard at press conferences, must pass through her because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television — and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump became nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled matters more fairly," Sam Nunberg, an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign workers say that managing Trump's Twitter use is essential that her personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter had ever been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know — maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more ferocious without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly because there are competing factions in the White House trying to push their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide questionable information to the president.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on an incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can become immensely enraged by newspaper clippings where he is criticized — especially if they are about harmful data leaks. Then he is absolutely forced to know where the information came from.
That was the case in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, founded by online provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them. He also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started reading the story after reading the story to ask staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a system of document management for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reports.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar representatives had paid FC Barcelona a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The huge transfer amount of 222 million euros is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros from French Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I am in the right shape of my life"
From the TV series The Time of the Rose and Pure White Sheets, the well-known best-selling author Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold Grandmas so much along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring, a rental apartment also left.
To light and sun, away from the old circles Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external appearance is 20 pounds lighter.
Weight went down when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were antidepressants.
I once got help with alcoholism, which also worked on fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes people, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who made a major writing career, remembers only the 44-part Pure White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to work for the fresh family company in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes served as a mannequin," Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts in the works - ideas for hundreds.
The orbiters returned over the ditch to the "millionaires' alley"
One of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands are again on a hair note with persistent detourists who managed to cross the ditch that the municipality needed and return to the field next to the houses.
The tourrs parked their twenty caravans near a street called millionaires' alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed to be a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point left unprotected due to the path.
The enraged residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem."
A resident who remains anonymous says that the detourists came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"The municipality needs to be toughened to act because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulators were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by banning access to parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another person who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the detourists returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even laid a horse in a grazed park."
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull police to evict campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for court proceedings."
Enraged people besieged the Portuguese crash plane
Men who made an emergency landing on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned today in court.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
At its longest, Portugal can be sentenced to 16 years in prison.
A small plane flown by men had to make an emergency landing yesterday due to a technical fault on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time, some of whom ran to escape the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man who was on the back of the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded a small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began beating its back, Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident, reported in the newspaper Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash landing.
Finnish star tragically lost his leg again won the World Cup gold: "Without the accident I would not be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finnish time early Wednesday morning in the World Cup gold banked slalom in a competition held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the World Cross Gold in the Games earlier.
In total, three World Championships have already been accumulated.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, with a pretty good heart rate, Suur Hamari, reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are many new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in each race.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been counting eagerly since he was young with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to get to the slope.
It comes to mind at times what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's pointless to ifs.
Those cards are played that are dealt, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and loss of limb as a stroke of luck, and Greater Hamari does not.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Greater Hamar's biggest board enthusiasm was already fading.
The job towards the top didn't really start until after the accident.
I trained with friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow in the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stay here to embitter and lament.
I decided to pull my overalls on and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair reeler Leo-Pekka Star as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at the sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal to the parasports people.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will also open the eyes to the parasports world.
When is it time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's Athlete of the Year campaign?
We'll see about it in due course.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Still Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he craved.
Next year, there will be a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We'll go get a medal!
Majority of Syrian refugee youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency chain, investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February and March 2017, the study was conducted by a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think they would return to their home country and 4% could not say.
The study found that the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in permanent homecoming, while the quarter felt that the most important thing would be ISIS's departure from the country.
Only less than a tenth make the most important factors affecting the decision the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abdicating President Bashar al-Assad.
A quarter sees Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
The resolution of the conflict through mere military action is believed only by just over a quarter.
A majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS power weakened over the past year, while one fifth feel that its power has strengthened.
Respondents say the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media would communicate to people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many made military measures and education reform a priority.
The tenth believe that the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the internet in order - the database he has developed is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example
The Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
Founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, the main product of MariaDB costs users absolutely nothing and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
Databases allow huge data masses to stay in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they will take advantage of the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the technology director at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful people makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun acquired MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a definite promise of MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company at this point that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the top twenty developers from Sun and thus made sure that the continuity of the code was secured with the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop it into its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of the MariaDB code development.
"During mySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates it will receive €20 million in orders.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be a contract for over a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, provide MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Among our customers are the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalé lists.
The database market is still prevalent by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is modest from a side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players like MariaDB in terms of turnover are still negligible, albeit fast-growing, sints.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, as most users pay nothing for these software.
Gartner, a research firm, predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open at that time or the transition would have at least started.
Big companies don't get new customers because most people next choose open source.
This has led to license fees for commercial databases jumping to the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as they used to make with a smaller number of customers," Widenius ponders.
Because of the difficulty of changing a closed database, most customer companies have swallowed price increases obediently.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult because their old apps and others are closed in a closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is coming to full.
As license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% from the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes anyway as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of €25 million from the European Investment Bank EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One reason for EIB funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius regrets how money is spent on closed health care systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that you cannot invent or do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most famous open source promoters, along with another Finnish developer of Linux, Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this topic.
Italy toughens its attitude towards NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs that will rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea on their ships that they will not continue to operate unless they commit to complying with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa in Turin.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers that promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating for only a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
"We can only judge the accusations once we have gathered all the information we need and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who re-use the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred just a few miles off the Libyan coast, as shown in a prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, which is considered to be a motive for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who oversees the operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who announced Thursday that it would consider the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they will not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy with rescue efforts has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which she sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to deliver results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that plans are to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner at Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain case for prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in Kuttanen of Enontekiö last December.
Police say a 36-year-old man in Czechs is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said the suspect had fled with two dogs to the terrain after his act.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when he was captured.
The charge in the case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be discussed in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-haired Friends series, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The death of the actor was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in James Herriot's book The All-haired My Friends TV series.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that she was considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the verdict and was allowed to wait for the application to be heard in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Weared in red pants and cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level, nor even mental health problems, had a significant impact on his actions."
The prosecution read a statement by Conrad's mother Lynn Roy saying that "not a day goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be proud of me and how I can cope with all this. I will do my best to comfort her sisters in this pain we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdy's Roy told the court that she is "persecute" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never let go," Camdy said.
There seems to be a precedent for the incident, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Drain yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion article, in which he states, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: The worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to working so that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the relationship between the United States and Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanking Congress for their poor relationship, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to upgrade the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW director said the company believes that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission neutralizing devices is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of following major car companies and ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions to conform to regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he may be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer accounts for a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's profits.
Venezuelan vote begins fraud investigation, major protests promised
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures end of crisis
In Venezuela, a controversial vote was elected on Sunday, which is scheduled to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be ongoing at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The troops are supposed to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years, which has resulted in a marked reduction in rainfall in spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM research institute in Provence.
"This will shorten the life of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cascades to the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water.
Journalist's murder reflects growing threat in Mexico
The editor of the once-week newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine discusses the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and an endless war on drugs in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: leaving the children at home or involving them in a delivery that underwent a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names in each group, no evidence is needed, there's enough observations and feelings.
The board is marked with the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make Mexican chaos life-threatening.
Violence is non-stop, and journalists are increasingly targeted by the attacks. According to the Journalists' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, journalist and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". The thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a panama hat that has become a trademark.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor was established, particularly for the handling of journalists' cases, but according to the Journal Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists rarely go to court, as well as thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting was of little use because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why the event is."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had only driven his red Toyota a couple of blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move quickly and flow freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is silent.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has decorative two-story grave buildings of drug barons larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and director, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival faction that is at war with Guzman's sons.
The story may have angered Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the paper came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish Riodoce with five colleagues, and shares in the magazine were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to be known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the Journalist Protection Committee's International Press Freedom Award for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Editors' Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The editor must accept the task that falls upon him — or play the fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce staff miss Valdez — a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean businesses, their secret drug trade runways.
They were excluded from the cases," Bojorquez says.
It meant, even at best, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting one's own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that is what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from 40 degrees Celsius.
The state government had ordered them to guard the Riodoce premises, which are located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists were half joking about whether it was the two policemen who were among the 50% that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
For this week's number, Riodoce's delivery planned three main things.
The boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant was registered under the names of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Governors of it have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of which "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would receive reliable information about the kidnapping from the Valdez column.
"We would have known earlier what had happened by now," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed 'El Flaco' because of his slim body structure.
"Now all connections to our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists are kept. The newspaper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who promote press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when she left in front of the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration due to another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests conducted by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of espionage and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico journalists are surrounded by organized crime, crime-giving authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed by politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut off head was the computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to cease operations, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Break.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals searched for a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who once had to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat on Friday at midnight in front of the delivery on the sidewalk with a beer after the latest issue of the magazine was completed.
19 people had died in a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be re-established the next day.
Sirens howled nearby — yet another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The editor of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked to get out on the street to do the case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, Hannu Manninen's party, who was 39 or over, was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
It started a long period of illness that stretched to nearly five weeks.
May was practically completely ill.
First there was the flu and finally there was a pediatric disease like an ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic course in.
I could only do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the training enthusiasm," Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, as shown in the rolling mat test of the Finnish Competition and Top Sports Research Centre KIHU on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis on a carpet with roller skis, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip.
Last fall I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I stayed only 28 minutes.
There was a wall, Manninen says.
In a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now there is a really good five-week period.
Midsummer was also a week and a half of vacation from flying.
I also had time to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening race when Manninen rose to 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until February next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a three World Cup weekend.
In December, at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth Winter Olympics of his career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela underscore that celebrated gold in Salt Lake City in 2002 in the team competition.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemies by camouflage
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a boulder of 1,100 kg.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It goes down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Leather studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it was armored and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor disguised it from predators, and was also protected from the top by darker and lighter coloring, which still occurs in many animals.
Experts say it was thus better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope, according to Markmitchelli museum technician Mark Mitchell, and Mitchell was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloring, where the body is darker on the top and lighter below.
The observation was still a surprise, however, because Borealope is significantly larger than modern animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to the point that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of the animals today, for example, deer, zebras and armadillas have similar coloring, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The predatory of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, among other things, studying the contents of its bowel to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe it fell into the river when it died and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back on the seabed.
Alberta was as warm at the time as it is in Florida today, and rivers and seas likely extended far beyond today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly skin has survived and has also survived in three dimensions in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous period
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive: if you squint a little eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was an era of theoropods, huge two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years earlier than Borealopella, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, believing that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified into the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from muzzle to hip.
Nodosauruss were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
They had two half-foot spikes rising from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through what is now western Canada until it was transported to the open sea by a flooded river.
Its armor has survived to small details in the underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin is still left in the bumpy plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also calculate the scales on its sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old young person, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police lock tapes and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, whose sign read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage of police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video in which another police officer rigged his rifle and shouted, "I'm killing all you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers he said.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold chills.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
Ferrell came to pick up his six-year-old daughter at his father's house and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years has been made into the documentary "Whose Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with his daughter dressed in a flower dress and a crown that is compatible with it, they re-discussed about "what it's like to live black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has a right to know that and grow up to it.
He must be equipped for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as black, and he needs to know what we need to do to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is opposite the police station, becoming a campground for activists as they waited for information on the handling of the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of an organization of minority nursing students. At that time, he focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farlar "just wanted to tell you" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was a doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's happening, or do you want a story you can take advantage of?"
The doubt was based on the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually whites, who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan recently said in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among sentenced prisoners.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The filming team followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak for us," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how local people are portrayed in the movie because I'm portrayed the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because they wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but a community." Ferrell, however, proved to be the most open to photograph.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and re-emphasized the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom are many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the document "self-intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"However, it's no coincidence that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news filming teams have left Ferguson long ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, convicted of blocking the freeway at a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate in his home corners is short and concise: "A mess."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has hung in the middle of an exhibition space with faces —white, black, and brown faces, between which one can see the resemblance when viewed more accurately.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is backed by two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a trans-woman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third last day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical statement on the malleability, ambiguity and underlying causal relationships and identity of DNA data.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she identified with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including a violation of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, convicted of prison: a granular, black and white selfie, where a uncomfortable Manning sits in the driver's seat. He has a platinum-light wig on his head that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a highly popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, who received DNA data on tobacco butts and gums, for example, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference at a new exhibition.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his captured muse suddenly became correspondents, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images comic book together, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, depicting a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and she would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was released, a lucky coincidence after seven years of hard years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now that Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leakers and transgender soldiers and is finding new ways to reinforce the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
The gallery wall has an artist's statement and under it Manning's large autograph, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to "the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A written in a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or a nucleotide, as the artist reads — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there's 30 of them on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can shut you down, they've won," the picture reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," an artist from Philadelphia says.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The plant was on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a sense of crowd to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the mass movement Chelsea generated, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought on suspicion of murder
Police say they have launched a national search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death. Arrest orders have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several incision wounds on his body.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder, and police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice principal responsible for social relations at the university, said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial management assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by email from a spokesperson for the university and Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope he will surrender.
Chicago Police Department Information Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he is urging suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly focusing our searches," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm says local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
He said police received a call from a manager at the Grand Plaza building who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the vision as terrible at the scene.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following statement to residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
The 39-year-old man was convicted of threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
Police said they were alerted by bookstore staff on May 23.
Staff said the man had "thrended to blow up a bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threats.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told the police during interrogation.
As a penalty, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay the costs of £620, or about £690, and compensation of £85, or about 95 euros, to the victims.
Scotland Yard spokesman said several hate crimes were not reported.
"We will complete the WADA road map actions in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and the RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organization's website.
Mutko said it contains nothing worrying for Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study by WADA, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the alleged role of the state in doping Russian sports.
Mutko said, "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit what did not exist."
Mutko's words contained echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke to Russian sports media earlier that day, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial statements and regulations.
We do not intend to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered the RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was given permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was "on the right path" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: Health benefits of maternity packaging "there is no evidence"
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDS, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
Distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of SIDS.
Hidden death means the baby's unexplained sudden death.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert on British health authorities in the field of safe sleep for a child.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them because it would suggest that we recommend this product," the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per 1,000 born.
According to the Lullaby Trust, a good reading in Finland is the result of a variety of reasons, including the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure," Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The packaging includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government says the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends using the packaging only for naps and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and ensuring that it does not get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä villain escaped from Japanese zoo for the second time
Japanese zoo staff are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshii Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The 35-year-old villain who has escaped is female, 55 kg and about one metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is free to travel in the area of the shelter.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The villain's previous runaway occurred the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of human resource management startups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and in some cases direct access to the board over top management.
"You can monitor your health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the companies Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, saying he has gained an even deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick queries and votes for specific teams. In addition, it can be used to create a map that shows at a glance which departments are most dissatisfied with employees and which of the managers have received the weakest reviews. These have allowed Errett to drill to the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don't become the next Uber. The transportation company has been sparkling since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and people who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry that, according to Let's Talk Payments, can reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a blow.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect an unauthorized manager, complaints go directly to the company's board.
"General opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convertent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and can easily connect to the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out a phone number or email address that could make a notification to the head office. Then he had to file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, the law director of Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
Quinlan said the companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical action in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public clearing of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came to ethics control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists, and both Glint and Convercent have venture capitalists to support them.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," said Nina McQueen, director of LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors get returns when businesses succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of a change.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm who has seen companies rely too much on just collecting information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard.
And whether their opinions matter?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts personnel surveys monthly and is able to tackle the problem the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff retention in the long run in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it will lose customers as well.
And without customers, there are no businesses."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked female neighbor, TT news agency reports.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home after she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a string outside her window.
The woman says the cell phone camera was filming into the apartment.
The woman who was startled by the incident had run into another room to dress.
After the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon thereafter recalculated to the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of eavesdropping has admitted to filming a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed and police had failed to return it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted to the act, but denied committing a crime.
The man had justified his filming by saying that he loves his neighbor "just crazy".
The news agency TT said the man was being charged with the incident.
Teachers demand more pay in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed," OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to make agreements that do not involve the holiday money cuts made in some way.
In the local government sector, contracts are only likely to be created once private sector papers have been signed and the increase rates are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that OAJ's terms of employment, for example, have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals were not yet revealed by Luukkainen.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the public sector trained negotiating organisation Juko.
Luukkainen: Holiday money cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector wage earners is deteriorating, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing at the same time.
According to Luukkainen, fixed-term holiday money cut will further steepen the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who are best and weakest are growing all the time.
The organization says learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day was extended as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the new training fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jerseys, their backs shiny sweat since the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of talking is a midday break.
Players studying in summer courses at the university return to the dormitory after three hours of practice for the final exams. The next morning they gather at 7:30 at Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one, with the aim of reducing the workload of players, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final final exams are held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started at 15 minutes past seven in the evening. It was difficult to find space on the players' already full schedules anyway.
Limiting internships to one day means there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coach season of Mora's six seasons that the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, although it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We burden them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes rehearsals from outsiders after camp. It is not easy given the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the shelter behind the paint pole.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises for video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
The video shot from the exercises is paid quite a bit.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing our best.
I'm not going to bother my head with it too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the constitution, which limited the presidency to two terms, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly well-liked leader.
In his time, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
Kagame has also played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact verification
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more often to independent fact inspectors, as well as present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact inspectors and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news distributors, and many feel that fake news affected the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has emerged in political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content as a matter of urgency.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that a fact check would be being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information to decide more informedly what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook's news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles function and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Book of Comics: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now this castle, located in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer who is fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says longingly.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archive-based book. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, whose inspiration was the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears when I noticed the thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love the archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Arts Council of England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not stay in the castle a little longer than would have been desired without delay.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was not fully transferred to the National Trust until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the Foundation staff were just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: by taking all the extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "But here families fought for even one birch.
I thought it would be allowed to be."
Some of the stories in the book advance from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who will join the English peasant revolt shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could begin in a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral with stones filled with a coffin (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "Family men seem to have been quite a rascal, constantly getting into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men in the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court heiress."
Rhodes is now looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a sanatorium operating in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
The worst relationship with Russia since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to working so that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the relationship between the United States and Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump called for thanking Congress for their poor relationship, which approved new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko to stop - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not happen
Longtime heavyweight heavyweight champion in professional boxing Vladimir Klitshko ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Championships in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him with a score in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild match with knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to face a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko could not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko's reasons for his decision on the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to end was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision," Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of various unions at the same time.
The Finnish weatherbreaker is experiencing conditions: "Take the vibe"
The pole-shumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
Wind and cold have taken away the woman's vibe.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Conditions have been a suvena against the stake-swepter Minna Nikka.
I hate to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get the little poles moving properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here God knows how many times and I have never experienced such a variable wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
It has been really difficult to standardize the jump this season, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva's Games.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's cold-stuck or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe.
There is no point in consuming energy in a bad condition.
He was able to enter the World Cup thanks to his hall jump 455.
445 have gone outside.
The condition is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualification.
Why don't you move around to train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technique standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, he's been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?

Experienced ex-official rudes politicians at Yle: "We have no room for division now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed a retired Virta in Wednesday's First Morning.
Construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, there are brisk proposals by politicians to raise a guarantee pension, lower car tax and support e-bikes Virtanen gives election speeches.
They mainly tell us that elections are starting to be close because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about a divisory when debt is taken," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owes children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started as Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance in 1978 and then worked as Deputy Director and Budget Manager of the Budget Department.
Last time before his retirement, he served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the current projected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All predictors estimate that this is a spike from which we will start to go to the low endow as early as next year, and Finland is waiting for a 1% increase in decades.
Washington changes permanent residence permit rules
President Donald Trump said the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, would be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her wife Prince Henry, 83, are not buried side by side, reports the Danish court.
Traditionally, pairs of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral," the court said in a statement Thursday.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, the court's communications chief, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the Queen is a natural result of not being treated as equal to her spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of her husband's wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
A moment of terror on the road: The car almost came on the freeway
Tommi had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but do not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash occurred at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from Ring III construction site.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family miraculously survived in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From Ring III's exit to Hämeenlinnaväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the evasive movement, the car would have come on top of Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
Parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other is under one year old.
It was obviously pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one who passed even drove us, even though there was busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
Tommi said no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue staff arrived, and the family condition was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says he and the cohabiting partner have a small income, and they received grants from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, Tommi says the family will not receive the money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family wishes witnesses to see the car that led the family to drive into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take kids to the kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, elderly car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or the early 2000s.
He thought the beginning of the car's license plate number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're going to have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen what happened or know something about it will be connected to the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department are confirmed that they have had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
Title and story corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the other car did not come along with Tommi's lane, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's performance deals with relationships through humor - Exhibitionist seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first guidance to the What? theatre.
The Exhibitionist is a musical theatre performance of relationships and inadequacy that have gone wrong.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still makes you feel good.
The subject is addressed through humor.
There are no bad feelings left, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been carried out on a tiny budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he perhaps playing a role or is he approaching another jacket open?
The uncontrieved performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The motion consists of texts from the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Exhibitionist does not directly tell about his own or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own values will be conveyed by the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from their divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist is drawing a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
He says many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The music adaptation is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to be a theatre expression director at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
There's two years in the back and there's another one.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The raised music classes has been an assistant in Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnatheater in Turku.
The direction has become increasingly interesting.
The whistleblower premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes will also be seen in the future at least in Jäppinen's study town in Turku.
Exhibitionist at Kouvola's What? Theatre on 4 August at 7 pm and 5 August at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers for a year from terrible motocross accident - neckline broken
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of mound landing toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtila's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the Kemijärvi employee has not tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtila was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds in my house for a year, Lahtila says.
The bay was bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the crash.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't use it to get boundaries.
It's just so hard as a sport that it's not worth too much for a 40 like this!
After the accident, Lahtila was put in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long start as head coach for the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the job immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be still.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his training, Lahtila often challenged his protégé on the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts didn't make sense either.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it because I just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtila as the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have broken than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtila started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the speed sports.
I switched motocrosss to Frisbeegolf!
It got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not require his trainees to be similar to him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture, there is room to be unique and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtila says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried
It's here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry — just as it had begun to feel like 2017 can't get any stranger.
Yes, yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence from the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples, and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being snickered, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with mild silicone skin that feels warm, as well as features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from eye color to nipple shape and type and color of fingernails.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shy.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, for example, in the mood to talk or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features in the proliferation of sex robots, replacing genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistive, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people don't start acting strangely or offensively until the market gives permission to do so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common while women's rights are under threat around the world and a president sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
The television series The Handmaid's Tale is not most worrying about its powerful imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short distance.
Sex robots are being made as much like real women (with pornstar proportions) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and their movements mimic human movements as best as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own — nothing that refers to independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist acts planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The head of ISIS, an extremist organization, led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb on Etihad Airways.
A person of ISIS' leading figures had also sent building blocks to Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
Suspects were said the bomb was scheduled to be taken on the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before security check.
Police do not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan for suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, a public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
The good things about Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
During Trump's term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong divide of voters has also broken up families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers' advisory columns guided how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to puncture our information bubbles.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been a button against the Republicans of our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all acquaintances — including a Republican-backed sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be terrified of his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrible chance that Trump will normalize the right extreme for Republicans, who suddenly seem quite reasonable compared to Trump.
I am sad about Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least his tax return we've seen). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild violations.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be lucid, and that immediately feels like a substantial improvement.
While my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to Central Park carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best thing you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
The Karusell horses are huge, the characters in the middle — the grotesque clowns and the animals that look back in horror — are ominous, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's characteristics become disappointing over time: views of tall buildings are getting bored, the city silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub, but that doesn't count.
The central park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to the point that two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their 40s enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at a department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
The same thing in the cafe in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the counter for coffee myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put their personality on the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no management confidence"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq of the club's representative team from the position of coach.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously an assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in its current tasks.
Piccareta from Italy has previously served as an assistant coach in the English Sunderland.
In January, Piccareta, 51-year-old who joined Inter's coaching group, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, so there was no other option now," Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat, the team has been sparkling throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been set aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly clashed in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released a youth photo of the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violin artist, posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several weddings have been added to the picture, which can be used to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders seriously about a young woman looking at the camera.
Long ago, serious, he signals.
If the picture doesn't show up, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram.
In one picture, she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as a mother of two.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look," Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating bullies in previous years.
He was already in hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was not finally revealed until 2006.
The healing slowly began.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital due to chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which he received after his fall in a cell, according to prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed against the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too mild.
The Prosecutor General plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal may be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country's foreign ministry, according to bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorizedly camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone who is camping in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the study's director, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes are hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, protecting the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Experiments found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to start appearing immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan was in the mouse diet, the more immune cells they had like this."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
While studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species, which were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, which increased Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerance-strengthening cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-strengthening cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects related to tryptophan have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "nero" in their ranks after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "nero" in their ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted with Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final season in the preceding game before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not yet in the best shape because he was not on the Asian tour of the blue shirts before the season began. He only made it 45 minutes on the field - according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius — he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'd help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of his four players he has given priority.
"Three out of four — you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match in the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level in gaming is high.
Their game was even in every sector," Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents in a tight spot, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the block.
When we played patiently and aggressive enough in certain places, we could rock with us, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, which collected 14 points.
Finland, who lost three out of four matches, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury has already sent challenges in connection with Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connection.
This is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the news revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent out challenges related to a meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which took place in the middle of the US presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means a condensation of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation that is seeking to investigate Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his related parties cooperated with Russia on the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify on oath.
A large group of jurors are a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence the prosecutor has determined in the investigation and decides whether to prosecute the case.
British inventor microchips himself to get home and car with hand swing
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq company technology.
Northam works with Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to meet medical requirements.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of microchips for cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also turns the locks on houses and cars compatible with the microchip. It costs £300 to process one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibits cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern grass field for the event showing American production came to cost taxpayers $24,000, as shown in military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board it. It was a attraction at an event at the White House on July 17, 2017, where American construction programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials became acquainted with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi were exhibited.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be present by mission-specific order just about 36 hours before it landed on the southern grass field for an "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, an assistant commandant for naval flight.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would begin at 3 a.m. in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave the scene until after the grass field was emptied between 6 and 9 in the evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter left the White House were delayed, another crew would be needed due to restrictions on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's house while it was on the ground.
The documents received by TIME magazine do not determine whether another crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to be broken," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed by the Senate at the time and looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcases products made by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
The HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grassland to bring the president to the White House with centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said the incident did not incur any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the White House's southern grassland.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to the presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter has a compensation level of $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico Base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes personnel, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 report by RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up."
It is not certain if Trump went to the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down in the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger rail traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is cut due to a technical failure, the Railway Transport Centre reports.

Venezuelan state prosecutor demands right to prevent appointment of new representative council
Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of the country's new Representative Council.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the Representative Council elected last Sunday's vote is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative council was elected to the country, which may, among other things, change the country's constitution.
Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the arrest decision had been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also begun an election fraud investigation.
He appointed two judges to the position after the British company that organised the Representative Council vote said the results had been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the Representative Council, and the elected 545 representative council includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to changing the constitution, the Representative Council can dissolve opposition-led Congress and change laws.
Maduro described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional modification as Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro claims that the new Representative Council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
There are numerous people wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new Representative Council is scheduled to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a demand from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities while he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, according to AFP news agency.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence was carried out.
The Russian Foreign Ministry blamed Finland harshly after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement criticised Finland and the United States for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
Prosecutors say Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to continue to control internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, Acting Director of the Justice Department's Crime Department, said the incident shows that the United States is also capable of chasing cybercriminals in other people.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali cartel will star in Netflix hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons will be seen from the series. The third season trailer has been announced, and it introduces the new villains of the series.
In season three, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trading organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more bribery and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a comeback as Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola implements exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional piece of light art to celebrate the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work sheds light on the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the things I find important concretely visible," says light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am very impressed with the invitation to be involved in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day," Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present at the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated UNESCO headquarters in honour of the holiday.
I feel very privileged to re-enact my art at UNESCO headquarters," Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
We will announce this later in the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in Espoo in the parking garage of Iso Omena shopping centre on Wednesday morning.
The parties said the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in a prohibited direction of driving.
There was a word of mouth dispute between the drivers.
A driver who drove in a forbidden direction of driving would swung the driver of another car, resulting in his car starting to move, colliding with the batter's car.
He then hit the car that had still crashed into the bonnet.
The man has admitted in a preliminary address that he caused the damage and done wrong.
The article titled with a question mark from Timo Soini: "After that came the Flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday titled with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats," Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have left the phrases "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood".
UN says democracy in Afghanistan depends on women's political role
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women," said the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN Aid Mission, said that hundreds of women are nominated in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections while international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election is the first time that power has been transferred from one peacefully elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: we are only a few hours away and rushing through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is suffocated by tourists who take quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move around the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further from the historic center while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The problems brought by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You follow the flag-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italy's Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say that tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organizing the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income it sorely needs and create a need for a wide range of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been planned for cruisers to go further from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, would certainly change if the administrative area of Veneto, where Venice is located, were given more power to decide their own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited by about 20-30 million tourists each year.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Bad miles of congestion on the motorway
The lane going north on the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has had kilometres of congestion from Thursday afternoon work at the time of return traffic.
The area is being used to coat the motorway, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road work, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h speed.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had also progressed at a rate of walking in some places on Thursday afternoon.
Road work proceeded Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, or golden deer.
I get along well without such attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released stunning photos of herself in the Grand Canyon scenery, among others.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in her current home country Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March in the 400 metres by touring 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 metres fence run at the time of the Norwegian record at 55.38.
Iuel, a hard-working social media user, soon after his records, found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "sniffs" from strangers, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to accurately identify what kind of images he received in an interview with VG.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along well without such other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When the Amalien was 12, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, due to their father's work.
Then Dubai, Thailand and the United States were on duty.
Iuel spent four years as a University of Southern California in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussing than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask nothing, but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally deal with the athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in the 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence run.
Foot injury took snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career at stake - now in the World Cup: "Nice to not hurt anything"
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career was still at stake.
The foot table stress injury had forced Korvi to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether or not the board would continue.
Sponsor deals were in the break and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull into the slope again.
The decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was like, damn it, it's so much fun again, let's pull a couple more seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September and October, but after a long landing break, just training painless has been a big deal.
The Games Korpi have only toured a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the board for Korve.
I've never counted because of one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years for one race, and then you're feverish that week.
I can't think that, Korpi says.
Today Korpi is racing in halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races do not like him on board, he always lights up from racing in hard company.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose X-Games in Norway at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, visibility is great.
I always think that appreciation depends on what kind of conditions and what level the games have.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on Finland's 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was at the point that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings new power to yourself, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up on the slope, but otherwise no, that's the amount of power in the guys!
In the background of the board career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for which he does training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, there's no more time to be in the mess.
But I watch at least the race results every day and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, raviation and race coaching are a potential career plan when the board career comes to an end in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like a bit like I would study it here along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the edge of time and develop, in the summer I may be driving some departures.
If it is my future profession, then it is not difficult to start when you are already inside the sport.
The food stories also include Elitloppet raping with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship heading to Stockholm at the end of May for the Elitloppet race race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months away, let's hope to get the ship full," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esther is the name of a new care home for 41-seat elderly people to be built on Kite.
The building, which is over 1,700 square metres of floor area, is expected to be completed next summer to the other side of the health centre's neighbour Health Road.
In crystal, a common topic of wonder is what customers are enough for the new care unit, as now during the Siu War, many private nursing homes are experiencing a shortage of customers.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee.
The transaction was about business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on the properties.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on this topic later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's cookie manufacturer leaders for long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish branch of the British General Trade Union GMB, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has over 500 employees.
Pladis, a company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "sure to be the first to be told" if there are changes to the activities.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to "answer concern that no funding has been allocated to the modernisation of production lines."
Drew Duffy of the GMB trade union is of great concern that the factory manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is heavily concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low livelihoods.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising cost of living and continued reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production in dire need."
Pladis's spokesperson said the factory manager had not received a trade union letter until the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed several issues.
Among other things, we discussed with employees that, like other companies in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and offices to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, especially in its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret her interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying a £89 million transfer amount to terminate the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked-out case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football league team is ready to break the world record of the colonies. The previous record was less than half as low: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for £89 million in transfer.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponent and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they seek our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this very thing: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Compared earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

Trump's calls were invented - White House spokesman: 'I wouldn't say it was a lie'
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the Scout organization have proven to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had occurred.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
Sanders said many of the Scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had discussed at the G20 in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not only did they happen on the phone, but face to face," Sanders said.
The speech to the Scouts aroused disapproval
Trump said Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump's success in eradicating illegal immigration.
Trump said Pena Nieto said few people would come across the southern border of Mexico because they know the trip would stop at the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying there had been no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump praised his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful," Trump said.
On Wednesday, a Scout organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' call to Trump.
A previous statement by the organization's leader Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologized for Trump's speech from the Scouts, speaks his side.
Trump's speech at the Scouts' meeting sparked much wonder, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
