Welsh Representative Council fears they will look like fools
Some members of the Representative Council are confused by the proposal to change their title to MVP, the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The controversy began with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Representative Council, regardless of the party position, are concerned that the change may make them a mockery.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "crims with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid party, the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a Conservative Party spokesman, his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the word MVP to the word for fool.
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context in a similar manner to the English letter u in Yorkshire.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently drafting the legislative change needed to change the name, stated: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council, of course, belongs to the members themselves."
The Welsh Administration Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on proposals that the designation of the Representative Council as the Welsh Parliament will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favoured members of the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviation WMP as the title of members of the Representative Council, but the MVP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Representative Council apparently propose alternative titles, but a lack of consensus can cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to have a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the functioning of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of office and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative reading, the members of the Representative Council may cast their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot box in referendum on changing country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbor is in practice a regional requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' bells are silenced as the churches of Harlem live in difficult times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say there used to be a bar or church on every street corner," says Adams.
"There are neither of them today."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "People's interactions have changed."
"Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood, where people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day these churches will close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people moving to these apartments would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants of 125th Street, a central trading street at Harlem, after they resisted hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "poor clocks."
An expert who played the tower bell game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first tower bell game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins didn't replace him.
St. Martins has developed a complex skein in recent months, partly involving architects and contractors hired by lay church leaders and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
Sakasti - an governing body of lay leaders of the congregation - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "seek to roll the costs" to the sacrist, even though the sacrate had not participated in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark harms 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while the boy dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was just excited to catch the lobster, but then realized that he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I cried everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Swam in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments where expert advisors serve.
This is a major move for the UK £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow, despite the decline in sales of fashion and household goods. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets tend to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's says its range of beauty products will double to 3,000 products that include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of grocery shopping to small one-time shopping in local stores forces supermarkets to come up with new lures for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles with low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, plus Habitat stores. The company says this promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how the proceeds of pharmacies in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a acquisition in which Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skincare products to four stores with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in employees with special training who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive environments and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "rag" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home supplies and accessories, Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "raged" at last Tuesday's tense meeting held at the Jones Business Empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that his new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home supplies and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand and was guessed to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in amazement.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to the release.
Marlow's headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
This Morning host is one of the most confident stars in Britain, and his departure, according to experts, could result in millions of losses for the company due to product investments, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing for home supplies, not to mention the delay in the release.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin for Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, became president in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being baked for M&S's new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "let us not comment on his business."
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about criticism in the media of his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as for his positiveness towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said pretending to be the voice of the "news anchor".
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first meeting of July as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
He said the United States, on the other hand, would continue its sanctions, which were intended to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. Missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom and remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience ahead.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroyed island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign voluntary organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's residents had remained homeless.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form the Travel Group of Return, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, given the regularly repeated earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely to lose lives due to the missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in effect.
Travelling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way back, but it will take at least three days for it to reach a new area of accidents.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the center of his election campaign, and he has spewed money to improve roads and railways.
However, Joko's administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
The pressure of either is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sunk late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was assisted by Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a goal losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before he scooped the shot towards the back post.
The shot was hovering high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Eventually, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match at halftime 1-0 after Eden Hazard of Belgium painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the heel pass to Mateo Kovacic before spinning away near the midfield and sprained to Liverpool's field half.
Kovacic played a fast wall pass in the midfield.
Then he freed Hazard into the penalty area with a great pass-through.
Hazard escaped defense and passed Liverpool with Alisson Becker's left leg shot into the back corner.
Liverpool will face the Champions League in the group stage of Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami deaths rise to 832 dead
Indonesia's disaster agency reported that early Sunday the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832 victims.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
Fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Palu, with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
The woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police will ask people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to everyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation."
A female police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may know a woman have come to the scene of the crime who have asked about where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim's loved ones about what happened.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told me that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless to learn what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it may take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two huts in the isolated area, and there were also a third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using ID 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of parliament became part of the rewriting story of history
In fact, evicting the statue would be a poetic right, considering that his own fanatic Puritan supporters destroyed English cultural and religious memorabilia like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "difference" and "rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about removing statues would target Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
False Cromwell might suffer for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell embodies the opinions of the 19th century and is historical evidence of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, caused by the monarchy.
Whether it is a precise description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate.
At least, it is certain that the mid-17th century controversy has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as a state manager deserve praise and remembrance."
Killer pig sulks Chinese farmer to death
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou Province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pigherder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunna Province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to a nearby pig farm was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big boar with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed the 250-pound boar that was sulking to death by a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
Surveillance camera footage shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig who killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others when police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, who suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the wife managed to chase the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can serve as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be properly respected," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread heavy rains to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as she moves over cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, Sunday at 5 p.m. East Coast time, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture north towards the southwestern United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity interacting with approaching low pressure will form large rainy areas southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 25-100 mm causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in certain deposition areas, especially Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas southwest, and Arizona in particular, are expected to have up to 50-100 mm of rain.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When tropical rain threatens, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into profusely flowing rivers and thunderstorms produce local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain of the rainy season in the area.
Fragmented tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last throughout Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations can be seen throughout the United States at temperatures as the Arctic cools, but with the tropics remaining quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday is seen.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer tends to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures near +26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperature could climb to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast shows that the eastern United States will have a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched a broadcast broadcast broadcast broadcast by six television channels on Tuesday, in which Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual crime in the 1980s, gave his fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies suspended their broadcast at a last-minute turn that the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations based on an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, who was intoxicated, groped him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more spectators than Nielsen's announced on Friday.
The company calculated the average for viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Figures from other channels that sent the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who look at offices.
Something about the proportions indicates that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators in the American football playoff game or the Oscars.
The highest number of viewers of all television companies, according to Nielsen, was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the center of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how the protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to a hearing in the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed her straight how he stood for minutes with his eyes down as the chords flew.
"I stand right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he's telling the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Flake said his office made a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to tell after the committee was heard.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to take Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was convinced partly by his conversations with his friend, Democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of politicalization of Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her EU withdrawal plans for politics that threaten Britain's future and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls a proposal that Britain and the EU would recover each other's import duties "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyde Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested the person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's showdown, in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB says.
Police say Simpson admitted to the shooting of Wayde during interrogations.
He was guaranteed US$350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Municipality released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police Department, and residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's physical activity director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement agencies for their "newsness and justice execution."
Sims was 20.
A two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball in LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "horrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater's activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions had been registered during the 24 hours.
The center registers thunder and vibration several times.
Social media posted images in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City covered a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
Known as "Don Goyo", a volcano has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a confrontation between independence-supporting protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the opinion-sharing resignation vote.
Police held back a group of disguised independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled with tourists.
During the day, more skirmishes broke out as police used their batons to control the melees.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "may Spain live".
The local press reports that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries during the demonstrations.
Tension is still on the surface in an area that supports independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when those who opposed the resignation boycotted the vote.
Catalan officials said nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of the parties supporting Catalan independence has waned this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or detained waiting for trial for their involvement in the holding of a referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a pro-police demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides have fomented the dispute.
"The situation is getting tougher all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in custody since last nine years, announced that he would participate in next year's European parliamentary elections.
"To become a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and oppression of democratic values we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 pm British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, they could shoot at the car with a crossbow.
Livingston beats Rangers with 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston confirmed victory
The leaguer Livingston amazed the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to a split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew was left without the first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday they will face serial director Hearts, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless pipe in the series for six games. Head coach Holt has not yet lost once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor with a lack of blade
Holt's team should have led long before their goal after causing the Rangers serious difficulties with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next thing I know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide in the goal front for Craig Halkett's but steered the ball past.
The hosts favorably handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
An important goal came just like this.
The Rangers caused Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball into the middle of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found that the home team's defense would hold, and much was tried by goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow directed the ball past one more of Livingston's special situations.
The concentrations that rained in the Livingston penalty area were constantly cleaned up, and two situations were in vain called for a penalty kick - after Halkett tackled the changer Glenn Middleton and the ball that hit the hand.
"A great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to every player, continuing with the upswing through.
The team's playing style and crew have not changed much since it reached the highest level.However, Holt must be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since arriving.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the whole game.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has performed really well under Gerrard from time to time, but was now far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle caste on the league table.
Erdogan received varying reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of repairing relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a group of 25,000-headed supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still a lot of supporters gathered nearby to look at the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the people, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the German Turk greets him as a hero as others slander him as he is autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwestern part of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's accident site.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
Roadblocks are present and bus traffic has been diverted, and motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report six prison guards injured in men's high security clearance in prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 on Sunday British time and continues.
The Tornado special police officers have been brought to calm the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible are taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, riot police officers were alerted in October due to serious unrest that attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drying areas can benefit)
Tropical low pressure rarely arrives in Arizona, but that is exactly what is happening early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remains move over the southwest desert, bringing with it the risk of heavy rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rains.
Phoenix's national weather service tweeted that only "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure status at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts rain of 50-100 millimeters. In some places, up to 150 millimeters can rain on the Mogol ridge in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and Great Basin, provide a realistic rate of 25-50 milliliters. In some places, it can rain up to 100 millimeters in total.
Rosa's rains can also be a blessing in an area affected by drought if there is no risk of heavy rain flooding.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rains can be beneficial because of severe droughts in southern lunch.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest class, says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes an invasion of the California Peninsula in Mexico on her route.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, which is still at that time with a hurricane strong wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low-scale Tuesday morning hours, from where she continues its journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday's late Tuesday.
"The biggest risks to rose or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rains on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning at 4:00 in British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reportedly in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
Police are asking for contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced Democratic Party 'evil and anger'
"The voice on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the "evilness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified of his accusation in the hearing.
The president said Saturday "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent merit from public service," he told his group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, I campaigned to the fullest," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats had taken on the task of "opposing and preventing."
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination procedure is expected for the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death expected to rise
Authorities reported that at least 384 died on Saturday after a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia, many wiped with giant waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the city of Palu on Friday, as waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many washed up to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the threat of the tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately run away, leaving them as victims of it," said Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian major accident mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km/h on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images published by the Disaster Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Evaluation and Application Agency (MPPT) issued a statement that the energy released in Friday's huge earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay could inflate the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and that the damage may be greater from Palta 300 kilometers north of the continuous coast, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communication links "are completely broken, and no information has been received about Donggala," says Nugroho.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not saying the tsunami had struck the Return, although authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building is passionately shouting warnings about the impending tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, the beach is hit by a water wall that takes buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of imagery.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that cut communications around Palu, which made it difficult to coordinate the rescue efforts of the authorities.
Authorities say the military has begun sending help from Jakarta and other cities by transport aircraft, but the evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff have reached safety in the city of Palu, where they have been housed in tent fabric canopies in the office courtyard. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As aid groups began their unconsolable role, some complained that foreign aid workers are prevented from travelling back.
Indonesian regulations allow funding, supplies and staff from abroad to start flowing only after the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night landed on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing lived the hope that their loved ones miraculously deviated from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian hang union team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi says.
"As a senior member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he was desperately trying to reach Palu's competitors who participated in the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the hanging union community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey mark appeared instead of two blues.
"I understand that no messages could be delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 with ATM supplement in Newport on the Wide
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26,750 from an employee of the Brink's security company while he was supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Wide, which is reported in a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing an ATM in the entertainment center," Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee was elsewhere's attention, "a man ran behind him" who stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several people flee the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identities are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "a character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously reported that the word also has religious significance for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
Discussing the title of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it is meaning "you".
"So I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shortest form Ye - which only embodies the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's previous partner JAY-Z has also occasionally removed and returned the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "never would use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student financial aid and opening up more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities would drive young people into criminal gangs.
Contacts should double the funding for AI research
The United States should double the funding it spends on AI research as China makes the industry more efficient, as says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, even though the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plans last year: it is aiming to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
"double the budget for AI research would be a good start, considering that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held leadership positions at Microsoft Research and the head of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions by the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, but by big corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
"I think those who have a PhD in AI should be automatically issued green cards," he said.
China's Government its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industry and academic world partners, and the White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on AI.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, in turn, invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up a National Security Commission on AI has not progressed in months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing country name
In Sunday's referendum, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia". The name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the North Neighbor is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether voter turnout will reach the required 50% limit to make the result legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
Supporters of name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek both EU and NATO membership.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska in Skopje, 79.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive effect.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1:00 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of those entitled to vote eventually cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents boycotting the referendum in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like China and Russia as part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for a name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" sound was "our repulsive future."
An opinion poll published Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute referred to a 30-43% voter turnout in a referendum - that is, below the required activity.
In another survey commissioned by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
For a referendum to be successful, voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a pro-Western government after it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats the entire Brighton defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his 65-minute goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a right corner shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet."
"We talked about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
It did.
Fortunately, he scored in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got a ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass through to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few contacts before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker poked the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face the Hoffenheim Champions League in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoilsport in a match against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why force the start line-up?
However, Scherzer, who is always as competitive, hopes to take over the pitch mound in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have a one-win difference to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western league.
Rockies captured at least a wild card with a 5-2 win from the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"Even though we don't have a bet, at least we can get on the pitch mound knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and another team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive setting I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take up the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet released their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training episode on Thursday, play at the start of his 34 games, and pitch on Sunday on his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the batter to the nest 300 times, with a inning statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, I campaigned to the fullest, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain who they hurt or who needs to be overrun to power. That's what they want, strength and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats had taken on the task of "opposing and preventing."
"And it has been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hate and mean and malevolent and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democratic Senator of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the public responded with loud booings.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, uh, I'm waiting a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions.
I was not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I am the latest Labour representative in the line, who is told I am not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way just because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a "friendly and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Labour no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that every opinion is judged on whether it is suitable for party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom he had thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me to turn around and statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - results in avalanche of insults on social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, the rejection of centrist politics and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been directed at me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insult every day, and never waver.
Normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the selection rule, the party becomes just more limited.
For two years I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything goes well".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago as a result of the neglect of the Thatcher government's single school, I have been working both as a city councillor and in ministerial positions to promote better public services to those who need them most.
I've never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my perspectives or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at the block tip
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a win in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost any games.
A great defense and more successful taking risks was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie may rightly be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still invincible, so I can be happy," he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish Captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over to Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayri's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's management to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose Bruce Colvine scored a goal after intense pressure, whose conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored at the back of Ayr's mul, who left the sideline throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick and inspired Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.

Navy bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smeared with the slogan: "Justly, the sea belongs to us.
Getting it back is our duty."
In Bolivia, which remained inland, the memory of the coastline lost in Chile in the bloody 19th century resource war remains strong — as is the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, a spirit of community and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians across the country are hopeful to follow the International Court of Justice's decision on big screens, hoping that the Hague will advocate — at the end of a decades of intermittent debate — Bolivia's position that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivian charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, will have a lot at stake in next Monday's policy.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said in late August.
Some analysts, however, believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin has no competence to extradite Chilean administrative territories, and the ICJ has announced that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is given just six months after the last statements have been made suggests that the case "is not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the question of maritime connection," said Zárate.
The rhetoric that challenges Morales' quarrel has suppressed the rest of the Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
Former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect with the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament would not occur unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by heads of state at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "far dream" to believe that continued sanctions and opposition from the United States to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon the arsenal of weapons, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has been subject to widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large headgear, which are also soon to be on your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a selection of special oversized headgear in their SS19 collection show that dazzled the styles of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical headgear took Instagram this summer, and these designers have posted their amazing creations for fashion shows as well.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with wide feather liers, which almost completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — just in time before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more like a diving instrument, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing in the streetscape.
Hats of an exaggerated size follow tightly "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter cylinder, which has been seen in all of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the impractical hat, which was abundantly visible on social media, also inspired another large creation to fashion shows — a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model carrying it.
The burnt orange reed-lined raffia bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a famous stylist, told FEMAIL, "I assume I see large hats and beach bags in the streetscape next summer — designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other communal projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council SCIS, are located across Scotland, seeking to provide a high level of service to their students as well as to the parents of students.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, graduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an educational actor who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject to continuing in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to establish relationships with people from other countries.
From this year's latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of access percentage among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data were collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the data, it was found that 72 per cent of students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support learning foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but are held in the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study program as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey commissioned by the UK Employment Office found that 17% of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by lack of language skills.
Language skills development is therefore even more necessary for promoting career development for young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have the advantage of this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey commissioned by YouGov, 75% of more than 4,000 British adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language known by a double-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in teaching languages is important for children today.
In particular, the knowledge of languages in developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposedly important to British in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Despite your child's interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this time, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment languages will continue to be of great importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the SCIS Council of Private Schools in Scotland
LeBron makes debut on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of supporters waiting for LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the season starts.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the rehearsal, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
"At this point, my career doesn't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the Supreme Court Justice's free seat, Trump is working to increase support for future midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 7 p.m. on the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to take a stand on the hearing of this week's Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which became ardent for sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate confirmation vote as much as a week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of these five events for the next week, "to wake up volunteer and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Managing Congress is so essential to his intentions that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign term," a spokesman for the Trump campaign anonymous told Reuters.
Today's venue is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls," said political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting spirit to keep hope alive before Sunday single games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon doubles were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-strengthening power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success power at the moment, according to them?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we're taking this success power as a touch," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in the sails and a lot to encourage, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and scored three out of four points.
Spieth has been a superior brick to the green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory party intensified as his round progressed as he succeeded in a critical putt to equalize the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Puttia, with which they won the 15th game, was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes the US team has not yet lost.
"You just need to focus really well and just take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet duo of Europe have won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only two who didn't do any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this boisterous audience, confirms that they are Sunday's favourites. And when the sun sets in Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to ensure a possible win in Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I prefer both at the same time with different holes.
The talk of European success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, paired with Alex Noren, who was the hero of the morning's doubles.
One bogie and two double bogs in the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swede so deep into the pit that they were nowhere near surviving there.
Although on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and doubles are fascinating to follow closely from the perspective of couples' collaboration: What kind of advice they give or not give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-player showed that the US team has a fighting spirit, although it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 leads before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and foursomes from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the triumph with two wins from the rapping Tiger Woods, and got a score balance high to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to keep the win two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the poorly played US team in the morning four-ball, taking the match to situation 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points for Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively called "Molliwood", were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball, they then finished the superiorly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through the two games on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and doubles, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned to doubles with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything as it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Triple title winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2-1 win over Jon Rahm in Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later 4-3 wins over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in doubles after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team risen from a four-point chase station to levels at the start of the doubles, although on Furyk's side, a draw is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of second best, it may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea 'nothing' disarms itself without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" in the past year, such as stopped nuclear and missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test site, and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will remain, so under such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar lament that Washington does not accept a step-by-step nuclear weapons waiver, which would reward North Korea for every intermediate subject, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US sitting president and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June in a statement, Kim assured of "the removal of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to officially end the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for 'nuclear disarmament first', and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals by force — even against the 'declaration of peace'," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the hope of indifferents.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding, "If the party requiring disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end."
Yet Ri's tone of voice was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing missiles towards the continental regions of the United States was inevitable after Trump called Kim a "missile man" with suicidal intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year Trump praised Kim with a lot of courage to approach the abandonment of arms, but still stressed that there is still much work left and sanctions must remain until North Korea abandons nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time deadline: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we prove a full, final and confirmed nuclear waiver."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of stopping the funding channels for Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met with North Korea in conjunction with the UN General Assembly, and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and the nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event of the United States taking "equivalent measures".
Pompeo said Kim meant by "equivalent measures" the security guarantees Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course for adequate rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will attend a course this year to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack to the university's thriving macho culture, where students weigh a long night with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students from the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I found surprising," he said in an interview with the Telegraph.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, guides students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor at Harvard University School of Medicine and deputy director of health services at the University, says the university ended up organizing the course after they heard how students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section presents students with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment, and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long a sleep deprivation can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know this has no immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe they have the right to know about these issues in exactly the same way as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," says Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a matter of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting adequate and quality sleep should be students' 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state similar to starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus to organizing a course covering all students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students could complete a similar study module before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students setting an alarm clock to also remind students of bedtime in addition to waking up the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electrical display devices and LED lighting on the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot won Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were applying for their first win since the February 4-1 game, which was fought against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard now only experienced his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current Premier League leader Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and with the Rangers' fallen will to fight, the situation was no longer evened out.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and the goal difference above is only Hibernian.
The Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the guest stand hit the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the lineup, with which the team had defeated Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up with which the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again paid off when a well-built lineup managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free way to the goal of Allan McGregor. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to shoot wide into the back post.
The Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but the last third of the game had no confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment after fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily rejected Lassana Coulibaly's butt shot and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long pitch tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the exchange time, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly's impact on the quick defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes after another.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers exchange, also demanded a penalty kick after taking Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
Next, page "Sunday Morning" from our almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and the invention later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter also plays a key concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches" is well suited, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists who appear to be quite cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place your headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really ratting!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention that still bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see' the malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ the malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see' proteins typical of several cancers
Koerokote has given promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory to be able to ‘see' the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "From our results, it is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was caught in the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show did not go as planned.
Kanye West got booings on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a sleazy style and announcing his running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The broadcast of the evening began with a sketch in which Matt Damon grinned at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, in connection with allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's rant was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a fragment of it to social media.
It is unclear if Rock is going to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated behind the scenes because of a hat he wore.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm marginalized," West says in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says he's wearing a Superman cape because "then you can't tell me what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
Variety said West's comments sparked booings from the audience at least twice, and the show performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the paper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected for the show at short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised his courage on Twitter: "Thank you when the UHMAS ROSE".
However, Karen Hunter, the leader of the talk show, tweeted that West "is just himself, which is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I can decide not to be a person (by buying his music or clothing brand or by supporting his 'art'), which I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same goes for us," he added.
The rapper announced before his performance on Twitter that he had changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knifer charged with attempted murder
The 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after the man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyackamore area, police say.
The accused is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Throne Game actor Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero's stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, also recently married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that she has a strong desire to address the subject.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is currently a source of strong feelings in me," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to problems now observable?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters it features are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues, "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be certain kinds to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or sequels of the Throne Game after the series ends next summer because he has, in his own words, "get enough of battlefields and horses."
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing the Throne Game has offered her.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love object of Harrington-played Jon Snow in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-related citizens by 14%.
Health officials say the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which marks a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, the HIV infections that have occurred in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of the efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican Senator information and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday claims that her employees had posted personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website that concerns them.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles assured that the claims are distributed by "extreme right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the published information was reported to be home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Senators representing the state of Utah.
An unknown person released the information Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a hearing of the Senate Committee, concerning allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that according to Hillin newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address associated with Waters' office and by a person on Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostilely.
There is no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In the situation, one must behave in moderation and calmly."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters' position in the Congressional midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's amazing if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that it had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies on these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for any destructive and dangerous action against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Underpower Rowan Atkinson Agent Parody
It is already an established tradition to look for Brexit references to any film that is tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which originated in 2003 on Johnny English and came back to life with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Reborn".
Can language-cheeked nation satire become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the gutter-eyed, cuminy and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His name already tells us above all that it is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the scold secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe the glamour that melts around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unhappy one-note musician at the 2012 London opening concert.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical world man who left sheer chaos, who Atkinson originally presented in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which has already been forgotten.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives by helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades knock on his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy emerge, but the humor itself seems underpowerful and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious' film brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and the crazy treatment of Johnny English doesn't seem to me as inventive and shrewd as the comedy of the silent roles of Mr. Bean at Atkinson.
The starting point, which is repeated each year, is that the UK is in trouble a lot.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field to the dismay of the agent in service — which is presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunately small performance.
This is the last drop for a pompous and tingling prime minister who is already up to his ears in a swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the skins of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't provide him with enough space.
When intelligence advisors inform him that all spies on the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved aside from active service must be called to the rescue.
Of course, it is a screw-up Johnny English in his own persona. He spends his retirement as a teacher at the discretion school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble skill of espionage. The topic sparks some clever jokes; English keeps School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endless patient combat partner Bough, still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to be able to get to her rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to His Majesty's secret service to face the fatal supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately becomes a farce: a duo disguised as waiters sets a fine French restaurant on fire and causes chaos in their secret pursuit of Volta's luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta's house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
The last inhibitions of the authors will run away when the final scene comes, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit made for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English movies, I have come to the same reflection before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for four-day work week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to require business leaders to transfer the savings of the AI revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan would allow employees to enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would ‘fit’ the party's economic program and its plans to tilt politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A source of the High-Level Labour Party reports to the Sunday Times: "The revision of the line should be announced before the end of the year.
Change does not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the transition to a four-day work week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesman said, "A four-day work week is not a party policy, and the party is not considering moving to that."
Shadow Government Finance Minister John McDonnell used a work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and "specifications" by public utility companies.
According to the Shadow Board's Minister of Finance plans, the current shareholders of the water companies would not recover their share in their entirety, as the Labour-led Board could implement "reductions" on the basis of the irregularities found.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies into employee control, which would result in paying a maximum of £500 annually to an individual employee in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on 60 minutes about whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
An investigation into the allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as Supreme Court Justice. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60-minute episode on Sunday, the program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open compared to his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing... I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came out, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut in stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasey, referring to Ford.
"None of the people he named was able to confirm the matter.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival in New York City on Saturday, is a music event with a performer guard as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must complete various tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, send an email to a political decision maker, or make a call, or perform some other act that spreads awareness of the project's goals.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that there are only 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clitivism’ among others — the fantasy that you can change the world by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" for different goals since 2011.
It says these actions have encouraged policy makers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to over $37 billion, which have been spent in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on which more than $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds made have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executors committed to "helping children's development to their full potential". The group committed to supply Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country. This was after activists had sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history of social injustice and malnutrition," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador to Power of Nutrition, told the public at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also said the British government was urged to take steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions, and the government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project to combat malnutrition, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions column on the movement's website is, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's response: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, like the major civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman host a New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Department of the Interior says the country could make energy exports more difficult by using the Navy as a "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Secretary quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington could "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria — at the invitation of a legitimate government — are an excuse for sounding new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia's] reason for presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke said.
According to the office holder, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by surrounding it, to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the global market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public of the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group profiled as a "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements date back to a situation where the Trump administration has sought to boost LNG exports to Europe and replace much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas with it.
To enhance this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump said will tie Berlin to the Moscow leash.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic meter transmission capacity of the pipeline in use, to be a purely economical project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is driven by purely economic reasons, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, recently said after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully about" running for presidential election in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "consider carefully" the nomination for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed he was considering a candidacy at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our defective regime, and this also means a woman at the leadership position of the kingdom," he said.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider running for president."
Warren judged President Donald Trump during the event by saying that "he is taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has been outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, according to an opinion poll published Thursday, the majority of Warren electors do not support this standing in 2020.
According to a study by the Department of Political Studies at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favor of running for the senator.
32% were in favour of running.
More than one of the respondents supported former governor Deval Patrick running for 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially end his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war traumas at Donald Trump's election ceremony
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after recruiting for the armed forces in September.
Track Palin arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
"What my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with other families who are facing the consequences and injuries of PTSD that our returning soldiers carry," he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma for Donald Trump's election.
Palin called the arrest ‘a hippopotamus in the living room’ and said his son, as other war veterans, "return home a little changed, they return hardened, they return wondering if he and his comrades in the army and the Air Force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun when intoxicated.
18 states and the Columbia Federal District support lawsuit against new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federal District are seeking an appeal to a new policy that came into force in the United States, which states that asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a letter of Friends of Justice on Friday in Washington, D.C., D.C., which supports asylum seekers who violate the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been made public in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says he was abused by his partner "and his sons of a violent gang". U.S. officials denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come from, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal for Asylum Applications that undocumented immigrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "will ignore state, federal, and international law over decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter of Friends of Justice states.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum seekers' access prevents the practice of damaging the U.S. economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring the additional labour needed."
In June, public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges to suspend asylum from victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons fleeing their homeland due to persecution or fear caused by membership of race, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on the new asylum practice.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even serious problems — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate survivors' rescue efforts continue in Palu - death toll found has already doubled
For survivors, the situation is becoming more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming down her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring new bodies per minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their hydrogenated things, and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude quakes are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for constant, strong aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounted how a fierce earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and tells him that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'provosing' with 'propaganda announcements'
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a US daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid annex to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering with the November 6th Congress elections. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US elections mark a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for the foreign government to distribute notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-excalating trade war, where both sides in turn impose customs duties on the opposing party's export products.
Chinese and American experts said China's revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa at the beginning of the trade war that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime Iowa state governor says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. working population, farmers, and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," wrote Branstad in a poll published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious free word and press traditions of the United States by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the press kiosks in Beijing Streets, on the other hand, differing opinions are only limited, and real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers avoided the offer to publish" an article he wrote, but does not specify what the magazine is all about.
Kavanaugh fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republican names stand behind and defend Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh can cause a counter-reaction, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections, according to analysts.
The feelings surrounding the case have been in big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," says Grant Reeher Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute at the University of Political Science in an article published Saturday in The Hill magazine.
Reeher doesn't believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer for an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for the national reform faction MoveOn on Friday, according to a newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November coming" as they protested in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Judiciary Committee decide to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 year olds who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans progress with confirmation even before Ford's statement of testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee spokesman for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned. It's about how Republicans have acted on the matter and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, a leader of the Democratic Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they absolutely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake pushed the matter forward, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least one else, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh was harassing him drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him his genitals at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new Internet counterattack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal repository", or POD.
It may include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information."
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, Inrupt's idea is to provide the resources, processes and the skills required to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises the security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some paid developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt's website. All of this will be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change, with all their business models turned upside down overnight."
"We don't ask for their consent."
In an article published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote in Inrupt "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains its position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers the Hero Priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only Victoria Cross medal-winning priest in the Church of England, who was a soldier, after 100 years after the events.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Pastor Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on Bellengline and Lehaucourt villages.
Vann died, however, the sniper was created four days later without ever learning of the highest tribute to the British army he received.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "influenced symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine guns fire."
Later, he plunged into the front line and "with the greatest bravery" led the troops to advance before his storms to a field cannon alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann knocked down three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died of a German sniper created on 4 October 1918 — just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that inspires respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann put a wreath after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honor to take part in the parade" and added, "a great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the free match waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament - TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the entire event is presented.
The event in San Jose included 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program turned into a great dismay of Pipsa Possu's viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy to stay up all night because of the match.
One mixed martial arts friend opened up on Twitter describing replacing the match with a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke".
"The law said that the content in question was not suitable for presentation at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior deputy director of marketing and communication, changing the program."
"Pipsa Pig, Yes".
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said the schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"However, it's 6:00 in the morning and we can't show up until Sunday in our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages started to go one way and the other and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that next time this will not happen.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, and we tried to offer our fans more and tried too hard.
This is a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to success.
A 24-year-old athlete says he didn't notice until high school when he came to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Daley, who spoke on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, says she talked about gay rights to give others ‘hope.'
She also tells us how after having a child at the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a regular host of a long-term radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt ‘lesser’ when he was young than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs."
He says, "To this day, these feelings, feel less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show that he is ‘something’ so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and will appear at this year's Commonwealth Games appealing to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
A three-time world champion says he falls in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "as a surprise".
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years older than herself last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
"If you feel so many things at such a young age" — he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced similar compassion and adversity," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — which has resulted in Daley's "whole perspective" having changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of only 40.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he's not going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped. It wasn't until he had really stopped breathing and he was dead, I finally realized that he wasn't invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I've been dreaming about all my life — jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song choice on the broadcast — Heather Small's song "Proud" — which sparked feelings as she was already preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Semi-fit Mickelson on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson, an American, breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must make a substantial effort to avoid record round going down in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays at an event played every two years for a record 12th time, moved to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and fursome on Saturday.
Usually, the American five-time Major tournament winner, who is the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to gain control of his punch.
Mickelson, 48, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course, where a long-grown roughman punishes inaccurate beatings.
If there is not enough resistance for Mickelson in the field itself, the ninth game on Sunday will be met by British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to win all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 when they come to doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else could you say about the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played in today. He patted me in the back, squeezed and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at the expense of people and he's a funny guy everyone likes to be company," he explains.
"Youth players must have had fun with him this week, too. It's funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup's extensive leadership before the final day's duels can become a bumpy journey.
A Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who made it to be the winner with lime lines just in measure of his nose and won with the narrowest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds itself of how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but won in Valderrama, though sparsely," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-1 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to 10 to 6 leadership at the Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going out on the field and doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for that.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at how his team's players have completed the difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until you drop in things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be given priority, and then we will talk about different things.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when everything's going well, but when you're on the field alone, then the player's capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that must be delivered to players - tomorrow everyone can do the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who gets to go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require better performance from his players as individuals than they could as partners. The exception to this is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three out of four points.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the turnarounds of the last day in both directions. He was a member of the team that won Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won with the "Medinah Miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed his team's lines to the last day's trials.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and we put the boys on the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defensive battle and he faces Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to face their European counterplayers.
"I put the group's guys in this order because I think it's carrying the whole tournament through," Bjorn commented on his doubles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate in the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014. The ship is intended to replace the ageing Cold War equipment, but will not be deployed until next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesman for Die Zeit, the commissioning of ‘Rheinland-Palatinate', the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying back-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals.
Important features of the ship also include its longer service interval - new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port sometimes.
However, the constant delays mean that warships representing the top of the technology — which are said to be intended to improve Germany's influence in the overseas territories — are already obsolete when they enter service, Die Zeit magazine points out.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to deploy the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk of essential "software and equipment failures" in German media that make the warship unworthy for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly central because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crews of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship is remarkably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's chances of subsequent updates.
Rhineland-Palatinate, which covers 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning amount of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of introducing new frigates have emerged as the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the Navy's usable ships "are running low".
The authority says the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered in their place.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could have been deployed by the fleet.
Environmental organization eavesdrops on the hidden life of bats
A new study in an area in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats make use of the terrain when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide you through future conservation measures.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland observes the poor and dwarf bats, as well as earnights and water wings in the Inverewe Garden of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the operation of bats during the season.
The organization's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species they are concerned are ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created in which bat behaviour can be represented in an image following the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats, and how different species utilize them.
The information helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking bats and related species into account.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful in catching prey than eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking technology to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization focused on the protection of the rural environment, maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 hectares of areas across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, rest site inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only protected area dedicated only to the protection of bats on the lands of the Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway region, with eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland found in the area.
Farm manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good habitat.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before embarking on renovations, as the destruction of one resting place for bats can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't know how their populations are doing yet."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the allegations of the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram to 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel for allegations they have called "unworthy reporting of privacy suspicions, according to the Reuters news agency."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for "mental suffering according to the seriousness of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved to a player's room where he allegedly raped him anally, according to papers submitted to the Clark County Regional Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a 99% good guy", but whose "one percent" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a compromise because she was "horrified by the possibility of revenge" and worried that she would be subjected to public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to a deal to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million contract.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' car manufacturing
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit," Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it "concerning" the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production in Burnaston at its factory near Derby if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays will be reflected in job losses if Brexit is reached without a deal.
The plant in Burnaston — which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis models — produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in production at the end of March," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about leaving the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit is completed.
The main concern, according to car manufacturers, concerns the risks associated with the supply chain when a no-deal Brexit is realized.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT basis, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and the cars are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Keeping a warehouse at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's plan for EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal, and we want the best possible deal that not only means success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers' statements show that we absolutely must be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far."
Toyota cannot tell us how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union official at the factory, says concern among members: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesman says, "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "must be postponed for another week" due to a fuss around Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the links of Trump's assistants with Russia, and any action by the president to prevent justice.
For months, Trump has been rumored in Washington that he plans to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardize the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of dismissing the president based on the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reported to have been Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "preferably" would fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with a hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "The date for this has not been set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than disgust with the "attention" of TV journalists, but nevertheless stated, "I don't deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more Question Time than any president before him," he says, and adds evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"Press events will still be held," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We often try to do this and have seen us act in this way several times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president possibly showed the reason for this when he appeared uninhibited and from time to time strangely to journalists gathered there.
Health Minister wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries in relation to fears about Brexit
The Minister for Health has written a letter to Scottish health system workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope to stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter while there are less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for the "established status" of EU citizens working with specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know that for all of you, these are uncertain times.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodors on Saturday, Tenssean journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him aside for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has escaped surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/wideness of the injury at this point," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for his first season on the team since his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used according to the Conservative Party's new plans to help the homeless.
The change is intended to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million per year — helping homeless people
Theresa May will today inform foreign buyers of a higher stamp tax rate when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of the well-off.
The increase in the stamp tax is targeted at people and companies that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this will be directed to government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee — added to the current stamp tax in addition to the second home and investment housing increases added two years ago — can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million annually.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to have opportunities in the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital, have become ‘ghost cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas for low-cost housing to remedy Britain's "fare situation in housing".
Corbyn has released a striking series of proposals for reforming the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of "confidential evictions".
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says, "I said last year that I intended to own the British dream of my Prime Minister's term — that every generation should have a better life than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy housing as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "her ultimate goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge of raising the northeastern corner of the country back on their feet. The team is currently in third place in the British Division II.
Ross moved to the "stad of Lights" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country's team.
I made the second team and that was it," Ross reports on BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as the club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his renowned predecessors in a famous company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I am pursuing my own success with whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and capabilities of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably only consider myself successful if I can pilot the team back into the Premier League."
Ross has only been manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's deputy director and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
He then helped Alloa rise from series three falling games and raised St Mirren from falling condition to champions over the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he took over Alloa.
"I really thought I was more suitable as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made moderate money and got to enjoy some relatively great successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player must deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and the pressure of work, but team leadership feels just like the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The full interview will be heard on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The summer heat wave has given impetus to pubs struggling with Britain's difficulties, but at the same time piled up more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but restaurant returns fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant company that compiled the figures from CGA, says: "Continuous sunny weather and longer than anticipated participation in the World Cup in England meant that July became like June with pub sales 2.8% higher, while restaurants had a month even worse.
The 1.8% decrease in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
The food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant runners.
It seems that people wanted out just drinking in their minds.
Sales of corporate pubs and bar drinks increased by 6.6% over the month, with a 3% drop in food sales."
Paul Newman of RSM, a company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: "The results continue to be a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the off-home meal market.
It is no surprise that the struggle between restaurant chains continues, although the 4.8% annual sales decline is burning, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for the operators focused on food, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures of August bring the breathout that the industry sorely needs.
The combined growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which compiles and analyzes performance data from 47 groups in the industry with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, considered a reliable measure in the industry.
One fifth of children encrypt social media accounts from their parents
One fifth of children, some up to 11 years of age, encrypt social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study says.
Study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts can share sexual content
20% of students said they liked a ‘main account’ shown to parents
One fifth of children — some of whom are up to 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of the rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to the Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has increased fears that sexual content can be published in accounts.
20% of students said they liked a cleaned ‘main account’ to parents to show while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 kept two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to "Sound of Athletes" to Scottish Athletes Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletes' Board of Directors, taking part in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the designation as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is highly respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as a voice for athletes and hope I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
The American athlete who won the four Olympic gold medals, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of transient circulatory disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell if I recover and what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I'm already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mothers like cows share opinions online
The nursing mothers of the company that manufactures breast pumps have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is boosted by a language on the cheek and conforming to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom that the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a grass-filled barn with the following words: "Yes, I milk myself, but the tail is not visible" and "if you didn't notice, they're not udders, it's not tits."
The chorus continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
The video, which collected 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked conflicting reactions among viewers. Many say it is making fun of the daily ‘horrors’ of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after giving birth," one commenter writes.

Another viewer commented, "Understandably, it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can't they be used to promote a breast pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?"
A third commenter added, "A complete reality-forced ad."
I also got defenders: one woman admitted that the ad was "fun".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advert is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and 'feel themselves as cows'.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unobtrusive pumps stuffed into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly inside breastfeeding vests, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and artistic director of Mother advertising agency commented on the controversy: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and recognizable way."
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on a catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to Texas border tent camp in silence
The number of migrant children caught has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because as a result of the crude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, the placement of children in foster families has become more difficult.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrollment as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to search for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal with child cases more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules, which in some cases require the case to be dealt with in the court within one month of the capture instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, staff at the reception centre say.
Many prefer to perform through videoconference rather than personally when pursuing their case in a court dealing with the cases of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to help will be deported as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published in recent months of reception centre workers and the system, the time spent in captivity by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that concern is especially emphasized in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's despair may go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering trauma.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to leave immediately
Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also replaces the Prime Minister, said foreign troops were illegally in the country using the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be acted upon accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "holy fight until all of Syria is cleansed" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a division of over 1,000 soldiers in the country torn apart by fighting.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the circumstances were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid until the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by a political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to drive political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area home to three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including those on the al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra Front, "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem imposed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revisioning the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected to a second term
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election if, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the suspension and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the "most dramatic presidency decision ever!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million from four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached a peak of 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
"This is a flare that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, head producer of ABC's Designated Survivor program, said of a minister who will become president after the attack destroyed the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of the conscious citizen to look at a sixth hour panel of experts arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, "a piece of garment of arrogance") and the consequences of unvarnished descriptions of Stormy Daniels President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never watch Super Mario again the same way I used to.

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a wonderful sunny day at his place on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flows from outside for a tight midterm election struggle
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has faced a real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of congress electoral districts, two candidates already elected will have to fight for one place.
This newly re-limited Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democrat Conor Lamb, who gained its place in another constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division unconstitutionally favoured Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties at the Democratic Campaign Conventional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the widely followed Pennsylvania 18th Congress Election District special elections in March.
The seat had been with the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won by 20% in the region.
Political commentators have predicted a great head start for Democrats.
The United States planned punishment for El Salvador for supporting China, but backed down from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panaman President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's leadership team.
U.S. Department of State officials decided to recall American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 including drug control, as well as development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity. The previous year's corresponding meeting was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from pursuing the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrators made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and this effectively ended speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some sign of the weight the government gives to the gathering, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity condition.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to direct an investigation into whether the Trump campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just in preparation to go before his constituents again, and possibly be condemned by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's defeat would be inevitable - any more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent massacre of years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable march of democracy forward is either accelerating or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled since it became public that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the president's possible inability to handle his mission.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, are we voting for Congress in the midterm elections that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will be in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved as an immigrant to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-decorated table.
How can I be more than optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers face Rapid Vienna at their home on Thursday, knowing that after a tie against Villarreal earlier that month in Spain, winning the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting to the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old player says.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we could have caught the win at the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got off the second and were better.
Thursday is another important night in the Europa League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this set we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can now press to the fullest, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings takes women sleep at night
Although the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey reported discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't bring up the subject," says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell your wishes in time.
Discuss with your professional and family where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost determining factor.
Involve financial advice in the discussion: advice can also be helped to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance applicable to cover these costs, or self-published insurance if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on the scene so you can appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of your financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent is on their way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just for the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medications are in use?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, about forty years old, was in Ilfracombe's Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police describe the attack at about 02:30 as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to authorities expected to increase.
Because communications to the area are broken, rescue authorities have not received any information from the Donggala municipality area north of Palu, which is closer to the surface center of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the fire since the disaster.
Key information about Palua and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of the coastal line in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative region under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main industries of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and especially the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have been hit by Return and Donggala in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of Aceh province of Indonesia caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck the south side of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of Sumatra's Mentawai Islands, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by Alaskan Police, Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for preventing and opposing a domestic violence report in connection with the arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial investigation prison and the bail amount is set at $500, reports the TV channel KTUU.
The report said Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "guaranteably innocent."
Palin is charged with three class A violations, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which could be sentenced to one day in prison and $2,000 fines.
Palin is not charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence, which involved possession of a weapon under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting her face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to a service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are cut off and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media from the quake moment.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack that claimed eight lives in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The charge is that Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway bike path in southern Manhattan, where he ran on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report relating to the application for the death penalty in the southern jurisdiction of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can demonstrate that Saipov "purposely" killed eight of his victims and caused "purposely" serious physical injuries.
According to a court document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the Federal Court imposed a 22-point charge on Saipov, including charges of eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases related to organized crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," prosecutors noted and described the way Saipov carried out his actions "terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, inconvenience and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliji, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the announcement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the court in the southern jurisdiction of New York City has given the death penalty.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York City in a federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of conspiracy for espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He informed investigators that what he did would feel good, police said.
The charge said Saipov said he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to the 22-point prosecution that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life sentence without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma that these events cause to the parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked for no death penalty to be required.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today at a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the Civil Army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel pressured by Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative line spokesman Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Great Britain would "be out" if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge between her deeply divided lines, underlined by conservatives in favor of being left involved in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat for Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as EU pressure.
The supporters called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he wanted to "shit the Chequers proposal to go."
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not fight world wars to end up in subjection.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely flawed claim."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexit supporter, also took part in the march and told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who really go to the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added, "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians should have to feel pressured if they are to reverse the decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to spin Brexit to have to feel pressured from you."
"We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country, which gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Great Britain is again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives about the security problems they had with the party app at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in order and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and frictionless border functions for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considering presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering the presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign in November.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters since the beginning of Trump's season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman at the highest place."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that they had arrested someone suspected of the Friday shooting that led to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyeon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man shown in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury in his head and died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during the interrogations that he was present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when he was arrested and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198 cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own devices while defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive the tail of the group, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pits later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after making some contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inside line, giving up defending his position after only two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
He was then in charge of much of the competition while prolonging the tire change as he aimed at a quick ending and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds with Räikkönen taking fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a true gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, achieving a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim at a speech on Saturday that she did not leak to the public a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of people's "evilness, wickedness and dishonesty."
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you year this information?
Remember his answer...do you year the document - ‘ oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Are we leaking...No, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations of Kavanaugh and the letter leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not good enough for the president who commented on the matter on Saturday's event: "I tell you that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought Democrats would use the allegations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and viciousness, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars applied for a refund for losing the Elite League against Friday's Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an initial lead position thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home team levels before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied up for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who won Dundee 2-1 as underdogs in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaulll's pitch. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a sleek opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched Cownie's handicap goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first round break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first round.
The home team assembled their ranks and Bouchard again leveled with a superior goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score Dundee's first lead goal at the end of the second round. He also secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final round.
Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at their next home on Friday.
Flight pilot died ensuring hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, the flight controller has become a hero since he died, ensuring that the aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers was safely able to take off.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and the tsunami it caused hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area and several people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in a wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He remained in place and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which is currently on the runway, was safely able to take off.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter could return.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of victims will increase to thousands because the country's disaster officials have reported that links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
"The number of victims is still believed to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the agency, said.
Waves up to six metres tall have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring help and equipment to the area.
His 35-year-old housewife, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday of Return and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after an airplane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, although an earlier report said all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had drifted over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said passengers were able to wade in a sinking plane to emergency exits in waist-deep water.
He said passenger staff had panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors in nearby dock repairs were involved in rescue work by transporting people to shore by a rubber boat before the aircraft sank into water about 30 metres (hundred feet) deep.
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents timeline for night woman burned alive
The prosecutor completed a retrial on Saturday, in which the man was accused of burning a Miss-Pian woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on a mobile phone to bring together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the victim died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that Tellis' mobile phone was at Chambers' house at the same time Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "will lie because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information recorded on the mobile phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The closing remarks of the defence are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is an Conscious Hip Hop?
The Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couple for racist text message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "again one black person".
The couple denies being racists and equates the challenge with "tightening."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her trouble when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day at work in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was black.
"EIIIII, HERE DESTIVAL," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
Then, however, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing the mistake he made, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that their previous Afro-American nanny had done her job badly and had been waiting for a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple to be compensated for dismissal and wants $350 a day for six months in compensation for the six months he had originally been hired to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a justified solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent her something she wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in an interview with the Post.
"But would you leave your child to someone you've been unfriendly to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and I said his wife had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Shall we start chasing another in a situation like this?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was adopted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to empathize with the position of someone who read the book for the first time before publication.
It is amusing now that Paddington's immense popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
He "described as a very important family member" and noted that his father was silently proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a bragging guy at all," the daughter says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you're proud of, even though it's not really your own doing.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called all the time and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart running gradually faded out of his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane among other passengers who knew nothing of the ordeal he was currently going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Sad women send cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can provide support.
Davis' son Tyler contracted depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile would light up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old younger brother found his brother, who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of aftereffects.
Davis created the cards to "tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and lost her partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was right down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He states that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they must nevertheless move forward: "It's breaking up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could really achieve what he hoped for - an investigation limited in time and scope - we might be able to achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee would 'disperse' the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court will be made more difficult.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and met with his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
A vote is held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently serving.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game across and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors drop during Kim's time
According to a South Korean legislature, the number of people defecting to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification and reported that defections occurred last year 1,27 - in 2011 there were 2,706.
Park said the decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in prices for human smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants and not refugees and most often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stagnant negotiations on the dismantling of nuclear equipment.
This followed the June historic meeting, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed in general on an effort towards nuclear non-nuclearism on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho reproached the United States for being stuck in sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally begin to unilaterally dismantle our equipment," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of his own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotionally overwhelmed and sometimes he almost shouted and lost his ability to speak when he told of his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee's Democratic members without calling the accusations against himself as "grotesque and systematic persecution of a person" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased to the Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when asked if he would prosecute Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, including the court he's currently working in," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders regarding health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we're expected to say it's great," Pelosi said.
Women need to get away with everything.
It is a legitimate fire talk with months and years of rage over, and he can't keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "I was tremendously helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry too, but that she had developed a way to say to her talk partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying, 'You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a path of erupting rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I cried speechlessly with rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they'll be happy because they got your mind upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 in an extramarital relationship with a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the highly frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least was still needed.
Someone called the situation ‘Snowiki and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since the campaign time was well advanced, he was behind fundraising and so he announced he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting some discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings - a system of gratitude for his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work on voters or delegates, and hatred of sexism - that he could not speak.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone will probably be beaten as an obituary.
"She cried."
How a US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The starting point for the US-China trade war was deafening and although the battle is far from over, a break between the two countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's main export articles, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties affecting imported goods worth $200 billion ($150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded in kind every time, most recently by imposing five to ten percent tariffs on American imported goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world's second largest economic power is receding for a moment.
In order to back down Washington, one should give in to one's own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts state that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing interdependence.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that are starting an economic downward spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than bystanders have understood so far," said Abigail Grace, an Asian-informed research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian foreign minister says country is "ready" for refugee return
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to the developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
Conditions now allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic efforts towards their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for its help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team's final score against 16.5 at the 10.5 Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, not winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
US star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and hit his starting shot in the water on the 16-hole of the par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Molinari, Italy, shone in all rounds and became one of four players who have received a score of 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was put out with a score of 5&4 against the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen, Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who was ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight of the Ryder Cup golf veteran, Sergio Garcia from Spain, became the most winning European ever in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It's a team and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, moved after the European team's victory.
He transfers the torch to his compatriots Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride in winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 major wins and will be second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had trouble finding lanes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was of high standard throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said his troops failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We team up again, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to put on a hat.
We met our winners."
Red grade algae bloom situation: concentrations fall in the Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the number of algae shows a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The Redtide algae bloom extends on the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be detected ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they are fewer than last week.
Redtide algae bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported off the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high hillsborough County coasts, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manate and Sarasota counties, background concentration to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and background concentration to high concentrations along the coasts of Lee district kiln and Collier County, longings were low.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
In the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms from northwestern Florida.
