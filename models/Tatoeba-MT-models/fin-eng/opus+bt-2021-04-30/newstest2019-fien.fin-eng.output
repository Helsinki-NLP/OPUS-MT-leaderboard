Eemeli Kooki led to Hurricane home win in the opening - Savo Volley's second win
Seven times in a row, the Hurricane Lois at the men's volleyball Championship medals began the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kooki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points the most effective in Hurricane.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
It was pretty quick to get things settled, Kooki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, supported Kouk by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was national team chipper Samuli Kaislasalo with 17 points on a match-specific contract.
The win of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra extras to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but the continuation of the medal line is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was the most effective with 18 points when the team knocked down Vantaa Ducks 3-0 by side.
Our game was erratic, especially in the head of attack, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different downloads when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
In the 3 series next to Volleyball in the 2000-01 season, Antti Siltala, who started his career, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, or atmosphere on the roof all the time.
I didn't feel too good about opening the house.
Miro was a king, Sillik played a good game," said Tuovinen.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pielavesi Sammo, even when Tuovinen was the head coach then.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, winner of the league's spot exchange in 2012-13, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening win after knocking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started just fine on its own.
Today, of course, there was a defeat near, as we were losing the fourth round from 17 to 21.
We dug up a batch win, and the fifth round came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective of the Tigers still in the finals was the 28 points made by the chipper Edwards Buivids.
The compatriot Aleksandr Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much grip on the guy's picker, Mikkonen said.
Finland number one in comparison with human capital
Finland is at the forefront of the world's comparison of human capital, says Science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and Holland.
Later, Holland finished one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked the worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population are examined.
The World Bank has outlined the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into splendor fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois reached the fight.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
In the early week, the International Football Federation Fifa selected him as goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, the best finish was scored by Gareth Bale, but his shot was directed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale was switched due to a femur injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted in the match the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goal gun that moved to Juventus.
In the United States, we are now attacking the right to abortion - A powerful documentary tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected candidate Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many wish that Kavanaugh's decisive vote could be overturned by a decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg documentary Revering Roe - the United States and abortion rights tell how the current situation has come to pass over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against a safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful document is found gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to extortion of laws.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending US religious freedom.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortions was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to revolutionize religion into politics to pick up voters.
His abortion strain was also rounded up by his successor George Bush Sr.
And that's what Donald Trump did.
At the heart of the matter, the documentary reaches the root cause of the politicization of abortion.
When religious organizations that support segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
When writing this in the U.S., there is a situation in which the President, who has taken the votes of the religious right on his abortion stand, has chosen Kavanaugh as the highest court candidate, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on a scale-language position to determine the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - on the border with major protests
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has been firing at protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun the use of force that protesters do not break down the border fence or seek to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza demonstrations since March, when Palestinians started weekly demonstrations on the border.
There are 12,000 wounded, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to be admitted to the territories from which the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
An Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick... couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's topper Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle coming from behind in the penalty area.
The referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation remains troubling referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shook a 1-0 win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
The previous was born last Saturday against the QPR with a stylish pecuniary muscle.
The work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
Pedophiles' help service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-industrial age.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Up to now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
A joint SeriE project between the Foundation for Criminal Care and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, in Sexpo, which offered advice and therapy, an email flood and appointment times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame to many.
The majority of those who perceive paedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a lasting quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who serves as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Chorean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange suddenly, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites for the prize based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The main favourites for Nobel Peace recipients are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the koreas is considerable, as last year the relationship was still cold.
Yet, the reward of Kim, who has been threatened with nuclear weapons for years and who leads his country with iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday onwards, and Friday will be the most noteworthy, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to participants in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates for the Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege's work has focused attention on sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered a UN refugee organization that won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has reported that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel got it.
In May, the journalist asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President went on to refer to North Korea negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel improbable.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded by three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in number one Lohja occurred on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make the traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Center said it could not be opened, because there are motorists in the way of a shock and they drive how it hurts, the on-call firemaster Pasi Kääriäinen told STT that he freshly did.
At the time, the motorway was even headed in the wrong direction just after waiting.
When the first begins to operate against traffic rules, a few others are often followed by the traffic safety liaison manager Tapio Heiskanen is surprised.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels are only allowed to stop for an overriding reason.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to go out and endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always be provided with as accessible access as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the freeway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases in which the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity," says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught in the bottom of the lake
Ilves fans transported by Inland Watership M/S Tampere would have liked to remain on board to continue their victory party, although the ship had been caught by its bow in the lake bed, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's chief at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was hurt in the hash.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board the ship until the morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the fire department by ride to the port and by bus home," Syrjä said to STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to follow the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to the far side, Saturday’s hasle was due to the fact that the surface of water in Vanajavesi was about six feet lower than normal.
According to Syrja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered by log trails, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumuse Strait shortly after the shipping route had undercut the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrja, there was no greater drama in the incident, as the speed of the ship at the time of the incident was very low and the impact on the bottom did not cause any more significant collision.
According to the far side, being caught in the bottom has not caused any leaks or imprints on the ship and, in view of these, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver visited to check the ship’s condition before the ship was towed off the shallows.
We are still going to the shipyard to check that there was no damage, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise booked by M/S Tampere for next weekend can be handled as scheduled.
The cruise season continues, according to him, until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services received an alert on the incident Saturday night after just half past 12.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but ambulances were not used.
The on-call firemaster Matti Willman told me late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to darkness and rather hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half three on the night of Sunday that all those on board have been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
A cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s candidate for a judge accused of harassing and drinking may be missing a top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well miss the post he is seeking, evaluates the program director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up playing for another person.
From time to time, it has occurred in the United States that a presidential candidate for a Supreme Court judge has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the candidate for a judge has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
That's how the president's been able to keep his face.
The nomination would rain down on the Democrats.
The U.S. Supreme Court tries to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional elections.
It would raise the turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The nomination does not reach every presidency, as in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70 to 80 years.
Republicans, too, have some doubts about the designation
The U.S. Supreme Court judges are normally investigated, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI's further clarification, Aaltola says it can still bring up something relevant.
Yeah, it might.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's propriety or impropriety for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be sceptical of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and the Republicans to disappear.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the broadcaster BBC that she identifies the Russian man suspected of Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian Military Intelligence Service.
Based on the photographs, the woman reported that this was a military intelligence by Anatoli Tshepiga, who works for the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning to be Tshepiga.
Even earlier, they said they had found evidence that the present identities of men are covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized young Tshepiga from pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from British police photos featuring a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Medal of Honor of Russian Hero among others in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning earlier in an interview with Russian TV in September reported that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throwing bags in social reform
There is now a living example of what the change limit for social reform, as defined by the Sipilä Government, means in practice.
My native municipality Vaala's social services are produced by the Oulunkaare Municipal Authority, whose Health Service Director has been elected a former regional director of Attendo in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal board warn the council of a change limiter.
If welfare expenditure now rises, the municipal state aids will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the institutional care of the inpatient ward of the health centre and a small unit of memory ills.
Home care would be increased, which means, in the long distance Vaala, that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be treated as a "home" for treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay its customers.
The left-wing of the whale did not swallow bad preparation, but arranged a good public gathering with a large number of family members, intimate nurses and delegates from other parties as well.
I presented with slides of the preparation of the county of social services, how elderly people in the municipality of Vaala are already treated most at home in the whole of northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a representative of the neighbouring community, was also involved.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it again raised the Oulunkaari preparers to their hind legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmans speak only of the service voucher, but do not tell of the level of treatment that it receives or what kind of staff structure Attendo is going to treat the elderly until they are hospice.
Without a nurse?
It is because there is no doctor’s night duty that the facilities of the health centre will be discontinued.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala health centre.
An example of the whale shows how city hall officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates are put back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty the residents of Vaala, for who will remain there unsecured to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was it one of the ballots in downtown that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, thousands of people in the city of Cologne showed their minds when Turkey's visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected to protest in advance on the streets, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations with countries that have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounded by a visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the review of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, reported that he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go out on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish-based.
In Slovakia, three counts of murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor reported that three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of Karelians on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a print failure, the Sunday Karelian will also have to be mailed without address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution into shared boxes is required to be carried out from memory.
The same was true for Saturday’s magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra leaf bouquets in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will not be sent separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Reporter Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala today live on his upcoming chat show.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she booked for Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, for which a bank loan was needed to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight, which took place in 2014 and which also claimed the death toll, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his journey dates about a year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us on his future website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book magazine called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on television.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's what the idea left behind...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued its lossless procession in the Valio League as it knocked down on Saturday on its homefield with Brighton goals of 2-0.
The winning champion team's sixth win of the season is guaranteed by goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to steer his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute on the rear pole of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling sawed Brighton defense into pieces in 65th game minutes.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finals at the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City began the season leading the Champion League with 19 points catches.
However, Liverpool, who played a less than one match, stalks only one point away.
Liverpool meets a series-three Chelsea in his own seventh-round match Saturday night.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At their meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Societys selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen was elected chairman from Upper Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen was elected vice-president from Hämee.
The council elected 40 members and 40 alternates, the Finnish Youth Society informs on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu offers three promises in its three-year action goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and support voluntary activities and people with their own growth paths," says the Finnish Youth Society in Finland.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi of Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believes that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vetel in World Cup points by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would punch the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change at the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told us that Räikkönen has been one of his models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula ones, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian sectional.
From pole point to race starting at 2:00 p.m., Valtter Bottas of Mercedes departs.
The evening paper will follow the race from the moment.
Football's A-young SM championship battle became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The football boys' top tier ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the start of the 13th round, the starting point for the championship struggle was clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to score a point against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to reverse in the final round, the second Ilves in the championship battle must win PK-35 and hope for the loss of the bays.
However, the talent championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vases, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On a break, the bayers led to 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vasavian player loss is that the team has played part in the same players the A-young SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the men's Two C block.
Vasa IFK has played practically against the fall of the season in Second.
In the two-final round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the guest game and at the same time hope that Tampere United loses its own guest match against KuFua in Siilinjärvi, Toivala.

The rescue department said the road was wet after the rain.
The police patrol went to the scene of the accident.
Supo looks forward to new ways to reconnaissance: Equipment procurements and recruitments already made, there is no hint of foreign planning of operations
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttar, the intelligence law has been prepared by making equipment acquisitions and training staff.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of around EUR 10 million would be added to the subsidy budget.
At the premises of the Protection Police (supon) in Ratakatu in Helsinki, full head is already being prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Chief of Supo's Assembly background, tells West Media that equipment procurements have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is startled by a video where she sings topless - campaigning for the awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video on his Instagram account where he sings only hands in front of his breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The song is a 1991 hit by Australian The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
With the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voiced The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to conduct regular self-service [breast] checks", Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this placed me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays for many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
The comments from the video praise Williams for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a stir in the US Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams flared up at the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for much more violent behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for high-fearers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves magnificent landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang, China.
It is literally located on the cliff of the rock.
You can look at the forest below if you want.
The rugged landscapes at the heights cause restaurant visitors to gasp in the Longquan Mountains.
To enter a restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is.
Hiking to a restaurant requires good ground condition, the location is reported.
Korpela's alley run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things end in time.
Today, that is what happens to domestic country drama Korpela's alley run, which has been quite well held.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week the episode watched 722,000 Finns on television as a first performance.
The peak figures in themselves have no practical meaning anymore, as the Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkisen series is not going to follow on.
In the final episode, Charlie and Mirku's relationship is again taking a big leap forward, and Charlie's mother seems to be the first to guess what's coming.
Even between Anssi and Miisha are warm, in the light of recent events even romantic, but then Laiho appears once again.
The police are also skeptical about the sly man.
Still, no one can predict the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is getting incredible news.
The last will of the distance is revealed, which makes a woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, Sunday nights will continue with new episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Do you think it's a good idea to go to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people draw lots to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may be infecting others already, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention release.
So you're saying it's a good idea to stay home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person does not have symptoms.
The virus is transmitted one day before the symptoms begin and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough subsides and the fever is no more," says Professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast to return to the gym will slow the recovery.
Be sure to wash your hands, blow your nose into a handkerchief, and throw the snotpaper in the trash.
Sorely moving, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you can't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
How, then, can one avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missus tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey player and Misses are often connected.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been given the 2018 Miss Finnish Crown to her spawns.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an InkerinFinnish and her father is a Russian.
Father's Russianness Voronkova was bullied at school.
Mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my russianness.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all," Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland race.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Miss Beauty found new friends and the ark went on to roll hopefully.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans.
After a career in the SM league, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived almost a year in a distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and get a career out of it, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and a distance relationship is the good thing that that initial spark remains over the full time, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death upon us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s endurance.
Yet there is little they want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are sought, but the theory of a reasonable economy also comes across major problems.
In a few generations, continued economic growth has brought a standard of living to ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, which could once only be dreamed of.
However, the long-standing exceedance of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change threaten the rocky foot of this market economy.
Two men were stabbed on the night of Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m.
Born in 1986, a man was seriously injured in stabbing and another, born less severely in 1968.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
Police have apprehended one person whose potential involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
These events are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's point - Inter's coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the smoothing of the match ending 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt made it through the right side and happily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henry Moisander.
With the guest saber, the Mariehamn reached the difference to the Turun Ball Society on the spot of the serial runner to two points.
Important goal and valuable point, summed up Mariehamn's head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg stated that the team, however, did not engage in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately the goal of the Turku people brought us more strongly into the game.
According to Home Team Inter head coach John Allen, the game was under control, but scoring again caused pain.
One defense error took us a full score, Allen resented.
We were the best again!

Lehtä showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet sure
Jori Lehtä's strong underpower play emerged when his NHL club, Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtähti pitched Michael Raffl twice for scoring.
In recent days, Lehtä has been featured because of suspected drugs.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehtä is one of 23 suspected drug associations, some suspected of drug use and some suspected of selling, for example.
Lehtä has denied committing a crime.
The club and player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer magazine, closely following the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehtä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of which get a seat on the NHL team.
In the training match Lehtä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round Lehtä fought the puck for himself by force, pulled the defender on him, and pitched the open spot of Raffl, who waited in front of the goal.
For the second time, co-operation between the two brought the goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4, with a guest game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Brave Horizontal waits for the team's coaching management to decide if he will qualify for the NHL team.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, the Horizontal said in an interview released on Boston's Twitter account.
In the riverboys, the Plain Woman, who learned his hockey doctrine, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-back defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit by force when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised, defender Juuso Meimäki received a pitch point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested on Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koski, among others.
Alexander Barkov of Florida played for over 20 minutes and pitched a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara pitched his team' consolation goal midway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the lost goal, Jonah Korpisalo rejected 23/27 pucks.
Already over 180 000 responses to the time questionnaire
Citizens have actively responded to a questionnaire on the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered more than 180 000 responses.
The questionnaire opened in Otakantaa.fi is still available for less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time period as other Nordic countries, Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
Fresh image shows change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the world's strongest man's title for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories worth of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed at its highest 200 kilos.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size," Hall said.
The British hunted the victory of the world's strongest man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if the title gets.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the April, 2018 World's Strongest Man Games.
Recently Hall released an image on Instagram, in which he pose in a much slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes that his present weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is now practicing five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was weighed by the Icelandic, Hafąór Júlíus Björnsson, also familiar with the Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Supportably caught on rock"
Inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday night in Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday night after half past 12.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted onto the cliff, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock, described the on-call fire master Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship.
According to the rescue department, personal damage was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are moved by bus and bus to Tampere, told the on-call chief Jari Nieminen STT after 1 a.m. at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumuse Strait.
The police are investigating the cause of the events.
Matti Willman, on duty, told us earlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficult due to darkness and rather hard wind.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers begin to check the situation there.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel serving as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
There is also a meeting space for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers claim unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's night match against Erkan Teper is shadowing the money dispute.
Evening Sanomat reported today a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius is charged with a total of over €80,000 in unpaid manager fees with interest.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila says to the Evening Sanomat.
Helenius's current manager, Markus Sundman, sent a counterpart to the Evening Journal, explaining the view of the boxer of events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically difficult situation to Helenius and promised to arrange matches and sponsor income for him.
It had been agreed verbally that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of the fees for his matches.
Repeatedly it was assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only receives the income they arrange.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The wage work has never been agreed upon and that would also have been absurd in Helenius's situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have wanted to agree on a distribution of income in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman did not complete the draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was poor for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmise.
Helenius never fought once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helmise.
A year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been assigned a "unique but large" bill from the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helmise and Kokkila to be a cowardly activity, the counterpart states.
Helenius today faces the heavyweight league of the Boxing Federation IBF at Erkan Teper Stuttgart, the seventh challenger list.
A man of heart and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
At the age of 83, long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of terminal liver cancer.
The host's death notice was published on Sunday in Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement reports that Päll died on 3 September.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The release was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
She left Facebook earlier as if goodbye," Ile Vainio says.
Vainio regards Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that Päll was a loved one with quick laughers and funny things.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finn Levy when I was 12 and started there as a storage man.
Erki and I got to know each other back then.
He was then a spokesperson for Finn Levy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw the great fire he had in entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a kind man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me too many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje in addition to journalist work at the Fazer label.
He was a music producer on the records of Vesa-Matti Loir.
However, Päll's greatest passion was the radio work in which he had an original style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ending in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The union describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full turn", although the economy is, of course, burdened by a "significant debt in balance".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
The careful planning of operations and financial management has been instilled throughout our organization, Kulmala explains in the press release.
We have also succeeded well in the acquisition of partners, and in addition, the profits of the world Cups were maximum during the past period of competition.
However, in the future, the management of costs must continue to be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
dozens of bodies lie in the hospital's backyard in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to postshocks.
One of the people who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Baharuddin from Palua who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Bahauddin told the news agency AFP.
In the Army Hospital yard in Palu, Dwi Haris was lying, who has sustained injuries to his back and arm.
He was at the start of the quake in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family had been invited to a wedding party in Palau.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, told Haris news agency AP according to the British media.
Small shops are looted
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby at the Palu evacuation centre, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, told Kusuma.
Many residents of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house is up and running, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants under themselves.
According to the news agency, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the paper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards had forbidden them to search for their relatives who suffered from the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land the Army C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies, landed on the ground.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are allowed only to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land on the field without air traffic control assistance, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night of Sunday, the whole country is spreading a long rainy area from the west direction, reports the Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in Central and North Lapland it is expected to run or snow.
The frosts of the previous night are not recurring because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A darker night will keep the lowest temperatures pretty effectively under control.
Just in the west, you can visit the cold side," said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will move in the east direction during the morning.
In the south and west, there are pots or half-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu from 10 to 13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in marine areas.
The actual autumn storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise the typical autumn weather will vary.
It's going to be a big fall now," Ilkka said.
Miss Finland finale is not seen on television
From IL-TV you can follow the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
The entertainment editors of the evening magazine will be broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final from Billnäs rye.
The broadcast starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from a group of ten finalists.
The Miss Suomi 2018 final will be held at the Billnäs pot in Raasepor.
Before the finals start, you will be able to watch the atmosphere on the spot in the live broadcast of IL-TV.
Live broadcast starts at about 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year the final has been invited to a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners of previous years.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other members of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, a well-being entrepreneur, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kalanen, CEO of Joun's Commerce, and Katja Lintunen, news producer of Seika.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he left for the pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the fresh Miss Finland Alina Voronkova Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova followed proudly their daughter's first moments with the crown on their head.
They crashed into the audience from Pertunmaa and were still going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before we got there, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, although she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
They used to tell Alina when she was so pretty she should start missing.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty pageant.
It was the parents' wish that Alina would be admitted to university before attending the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to finish a kandi degree before the pageant.
We asked him last year why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish that kandi.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults as well.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthyly.
And Alina likes to be featured, you can see it.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey for a living in Japan, and he did not get to Finland to encourage his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the young people's relationship lasts a year.
Yes, that's the point!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break since we've been visiting because of the missus.
I already miss it, even though they've been sending messages.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti. Police caught three people.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - thought of the idea of a comic book: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic fool once left my husband's statement, in which he suggested it as a person for the story I developed, says Espoan comic book blogger, home mom and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU economic and legal translator in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've had a great time as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, "What would you do when you grow up when you're little?"
Then 2014 came a comic book.
The bishop tells us that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, although he had read Aku Duck, Tint, and Asterix since he was little.
The last time I had drawn was when I was a child, but when these Organic Stuff manuscripts began to come about, the situation changed.
I first wrote a few dozen manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I could not persuade her to join until the summer of 2016 when I bribed the Line with the help of a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen stripes, and then he was forced to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing plate was a great incentive for him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to accomplish something.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, says Bishop about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop into my head all the time, but usually I don't finish at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might do one screen at a time, and I'd love to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest part, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams's Dilbert, among others, in the contemporary comics of newspapers.
The people of the organic hömp are the carrot-body mother, who has a salad hair padding, who has an L theme.
Other people are Man, Piss, and Twins.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the show come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer you a bun, even though the Organic Grumpy sometimes pushes the point.
The bishop tells us that he is reading his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing and it says that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for a housewife!

The Indonesian earthquake: The pilot sacrificed himself - did not leave a fissile tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe
A 21-year-old air traffic controller, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he escorted a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off an earthquake - shaking island.
The youth was in charge of air traffic control at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway to the air.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation agent told The Jakarta Post.
The quake further intensified after the flight reached the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn pondered the conclusion of Europe to the trade war: "We have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the whole world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
In the first morning of Yle, Director-General Olli Rehn said that while tightening voltage has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn felt that Europe was a very good mina.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be at the foot of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate.
We have an unforeseeable partner in the Washington direction, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted sharply to the clear deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and unsorted credits account for more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again overstepping its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another thing that is testing Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would work out.
The contentious difference would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will withdraw from office after a year or more.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in speeches.
Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on the matter further.
HS Super Popular Black Box performances continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
The popular Black Box performances organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23 Black box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets to the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers appearing on stage during the evening will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS instrument.
There's something I'm sure no one's ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and an addressable story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with the editors and photographers of HS and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has arranged evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the outset and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have been in the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Award as a journalistic act of the year.
Rewarders commended a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The proposal, which will then be seen, has a different content than in this autumn's evenings.
The missing sponger was found thanks to "an unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police's drone expertise is top of the world: "We are being asked about training"
According to the Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
On Tuesday, the police in Oulu managed to find a lost sponge in Raahe in just a few minutes with the help of a drone.
Kimmo Himberg, headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "by means of an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also the world's top player here."
Drone is a very new piece of work, and he's even more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been demonstrated, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere," says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the Finnish police drone operations.
We're being asked for training.
More widespread
Himberg points out that finding lost in Finnish winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Already, drone is widely used in police duties, and their use is becoming widespread and increasing in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, according to Himberg, police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of reconnaissance missions.
For example, we already need to check a region a little further, where it is possible to fear violence.
Drone can then be used for preliminary intelligence.
Karelian Rugby entered number one divar
On Saturday, Karelian Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio.
The Joensuuns were still midway through the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period found a plot and porched the Southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division Championship knew the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to Division 1.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at the time Finnish rugby serial operations had been divided into two levels, the SM series and several blocks of 1 division.
The club is going to take the show place, but it will be quite a job for next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players needs to be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gambling trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Eagleniemi starts the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens playing in the Ice Hockey NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will begin the season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved a super promise for the Eagleniemi, 18, in the first round with number three at the summer booking event.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has performed strong excerpts in September training matches.
The Eagleniemi immediately managed to score in their first training match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts next week on the night against Thursday Finnish time.
Montreal faces Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
Much has been said about leadership in Finland this week.
Risto Silasmaa, chairman of the Nokia Board, reported in an HS interview on her book Paranoid optimist, where she shed light on her philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also mentioned the inability of leaders to serve as a team; fear and speechlessness, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's rise stage disappeared.
During the week, the business event Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business world stars emerged on stage.
There was enough talk of good management.
The legend of leadership doctrines, Gary Hamel, said that a good leader must dare take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods retail chain known for a wide range of organics, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book about introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are surveyed to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly, and resolutely.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the company's life cycle phase.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell a story on which the company's future is based.
A company that grew up in a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were heard by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of being informed.
A good leader requires a great deal.
That's why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in the scenes, comrades.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from the outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on a gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's spectacular dress also had a lace-grab.
A little jet lag.
I came back from L.A. again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me how he's doing.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for an audition.
Among other things, he's been doing ad shoots.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also as similar to that in Finland.
True, he says that work must be done even harder, as there is always an easy replacement for model work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors' EUR 30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural award on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works on choreography, communal activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for in a major operation: "We can't tell you where"
Extensive searches by the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Øresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlann were closed in Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henry Storm from the Copenhagen police briefing tells the Evening Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo doesn't have a direct connection to the threat, according to the police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet reported on the police's Saturday briefing.
Chief Research Officer Jørgen Bergen Skov was the conduct of a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime title was being investigated.
Skov, however, said that this is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been apprehended.
According to the paper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has cause for concern, as certain people were threatened.
The Macedonian name has caused decades of dissension - now the people are voting on it in controversial elections
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate is in favour of Macedonia's EU-NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
The retired nurse who voted at the school, Olivera Argirosvka, hoped for support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
That means a change, especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the approval of the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is a lot of tension about whether the turnout is higher than the 50% required.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
That's a handsome win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match late Saturday night in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnish took measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, located next to Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF union heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to take on more difficult tasks, which are of considerable economic importance, as seen on Saturday.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with a hard left hand strike.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Northic Nightmare" hurt its opponent already in the third period, when a German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
Then Teper pleaded injury and withdrew from the match.
It then turned out that the German had been burned twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 matches from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who left for the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with a stable order to win - the difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One Championship title approached its confirmation again, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian gp and stretched his World Cup score lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vetel as early as 50 points (306-256).
There's only five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the race pole, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who had won his career opening victory, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari fourth.
Max Verstappen, who started Red Bull from the last line of departure, was the fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu - were caught a block away
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Bridge Street 12 on Saturday after 6 pm.
Police also say that the men took the victim's phone, among other things.
Police reached suspects, i.e. a 35-year-old man with haywater and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, from the end of the block shortly after the event.
They were arrested as a suspect in a robbery, police report.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require medical attention.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, leaves his position as chairman of the company's board of directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission SEC has accused Muski of securities fraud.
Musk continues to be CEO of Tesla, but the company must also pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Muski is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to reach agreement on Naphta with the United States
Time is threatening to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and their negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canadian chief negotiator, Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago for the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to put the agreement into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Ozor, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the treaty at the end of November, whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the Congress of the United States sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were flashing into a fire in Kaakur - the fire department was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in an apartment in Kaakkuri, Oulu caused a fire alarm on the night of Sunday.
A dozen emergency services units were alerted due to a possible apartment building fire.
At the scene, it was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna in an apartment apartment had looked like a fire to the house across the street, which was why the emergency center had been informed.
There was no fire on the target.
The police caught 11 people after the Honka-HJK match - brawling in the field and at the subway station
The police caught eleven people after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo on Saturday, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to the STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disorder.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The captures were reported earlier by the Evening Sanomat.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of viewers rushed into the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation resulted in pushing and fistfights between team supporters.
One of the things that was needed to put an end to the situation was the Horse Cops.
In addition to the field, rioting took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I was not there, but what I saw from the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to a riot in the field.
According to the color, no criminal reports have been reported as a result of the events.
The table stone was stirring up butterfly swimming at its SE time in the world cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have advanced to the finals on the closing day of World Swimming Cup 3/7 races in Holland.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Tablestone alarmed Finland's record in 50 m butterfly swimming, where he was the second in the primary period at 22,82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki for the journey of the SE-era of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo-based Cetus, was the 24th butterfly swim at 24.68.
The Swimming Club Vuokat's Laukkanen was the sixth in the early 50-metre breaststrokes at 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
In the early batches of two hundred metres, Laukkanen was the 15th at 2.14.25.
The students play a rare treat: the ancient tragedy - reduced Orestea affects its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre School brought to the tour beginning with the National Theatre the only play trilogy that survived as a whole, Oresteia of Aeschylos.
In the stage open! projects that started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre School work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Orestea was premiered internationally in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Orestea sums up the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the Atreus family condemned to destruction and the birth of the rule of law with merit for hours to twenty minutes, especially by condensing choir sections.
The work manages to be very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simona's fine English (2003).
Dramatic lights and the display of the theater space pages highlight a simplified and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is alternately the dynamics between choir breakaway, title actors, and choir performers.
The performance uses both double and triple chairs for name roles.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, who return from the Trojan War, are also shown on the stage, unlike the custom of the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created before the eyes of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of master's-stage acting students as a close group, indeed as one organism.
Especially in choir sections, very expressive, sculpture-like group formations, flexible actors gain their rights on the bare, only white curtain adorned, staged.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new one is beginning to appear in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA utility vehicle exhibition, Hyundai supplies a thousand car batch of novelty model for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing a fuel cell-powered truck on the market, Hyundai continues on the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles by, for example, following the development of the refueling network," Hyundai Motor's Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the contract.
The fists fluttered on several occasions in Kajaan
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men at a restaurant in the center of Kajaani and off it on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, resulting in his being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser hit him too.
The police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another policeman in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to jail to calm him down.
The case is investigated as three assaults and violent opposition by an official.
Another assault incident occurred in the center of Kajaani on Midway street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, an approximately 20-year-old Kayan man hit the victim.
A short while later, another man knocked him down and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators already left before the police arrived.
Police ask eyewitnesses of the event to contact Kajaani police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu@polipoliit.fi.
Longline radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Here we go.
Even the doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation in the Evening Journal a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
With these rings of years, when a subject is amazed, it is usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karyan, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at once even a little angry.
I also spoke on the case Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert for the Association of Services (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
The police are only clearly aware of serious cases and many real violence situations remain unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to record their near-miss situation on the basis of the Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always lead to physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can still be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid of what they do in their workplace, even if it doesn't happen.
Some neighborhoods are troubled.
The store has acquired security.
As the opening hours of the shops were released, the media also had a rather large effect on the sellers' safety.
"Then a lot of employers arranged security services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, due to guarding, the disruptions remained well under control, an image arose that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions to remove costly guard services.
A minor assault is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that a battered seller does not want to make a request for an inquiry about a criminal who usually lives near a store.
But according to the same paragraph of the Act of 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, customs would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery trade must be open in small towns almost night and night must guarantee the safety of the shop's workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's crowning this year is not seen in the traditional way on TV, but is shown by the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of the Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Prior to direct broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived there about the passage of the broadcast.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this man host of ours, Sohlberg acclaimed his colleagues while the audience cheered.
The Eturiv Games are followed by many of the previous years' Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, then Iiro is married!
Sohlberg chipped at the Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg referred with his throw to the newly divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although initially seemed confused.
The Sieppi spoke of his divorce for the first time in the Evening Sanomat weekend paper.
The missikaunotar said that she did not want to open the reasons for the divorce more closely in public, as it is between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry for a new relationship, he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own business, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host three laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the screw-up.
The bottom man tortured his tied common-law spouse by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for a number of crimes committed against his common-law spouse for three years to prison.
The instrument used to commit crime included belt, cable, and bundle ties.
The court condemned the items in question to the State's loss.
Rank's charge was a suspect in a felony rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two acts of injury were attributed to the Kokkolan.
Crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the final act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to be held still in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
A 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivation of liberty and of aggravated rape on May 22nd.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court unproven.
The case was handled in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public report on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats, and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
With his sentence, the court ordered the state to lose the instrumentalities of the crime: the belt and cable, bundle ties, the bathrobe belt, the knife, and the pullover.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It is clear from the operative part that a large proportion of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the criminal procedure.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old must pay his victim compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
He hardly has that money, since the condemned man already has debts in his legacy.
The prison sentence is not the first for a man.
The evening paper does not state the name of the condemned person in order to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district sentence does not have the force of law when writing this.
Europe at the top of four points for the Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals captured their lead on Saturday in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6 while the twelve doubles are still to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon four-game the winnings were equalized 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games as a pair during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the duo pursues more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cup, and of the Americans, there have been no more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in Honka game: "Violence is not part of football"
The football betting league team HJK released a bulletin on Sunday condemning its supporters' disorderly behaviour in Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We regret the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the press release states.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to seek to fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers were not able to calm the situation down, but police officers and also horsemen were needed.
HJK reports in his press release that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We strongly denounce any activity that endangers the safety of match events," states the press release.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organizers to identify threats to safety and to remove mild phenomena.
Proponent culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support in every way positive, cheerful and encouraging action in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," says the press release.
A Philippine inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic jams.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a world-growing group who vows to have invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has used much of his possessions to build his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
More recently, he says he made the first successful test flight... he slipped on his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will generate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow's industrial action will be visible in child day care and social and health services
In the public and well-being sectors tomorrow, the bans on overtime and shift change are particularly visible in social and health services and in day care for children, assessed by Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there will not be enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their children.
The employer's job now is to make sure that the services are played and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to hire staff, but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet a combat action.
It is quite the norm in terms of health and safety at work that regular working hours are taken care of for each worker and are done only with them.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader for municipal employers, will not undertake a pre-assessment of the impact of the bans on overtime and shift.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jalonen said to STT.
Jalonen says that last week there was already experience of similar activities carried out by the Association of Local and Deficit Nurses and the Association of Social and Health Care Professionals Tehy, for three days.
Their effects were rather limited.
The ban on overtime and shift change of JHL applies to employees in the fields of municipalities, church, state and private social and health care.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial battle affects nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's activities may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the denunciation law continues.
The government should now admit that it is running into the wall and hard.
The noble feels that both the ay movement and the government must meet.
What's special about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, although the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The great coral reef is created with the strength of children and adults - the fitness of the performance is studied by the gestures of the skate and seahorse.
In other premises, the collective Great Coral reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it aired for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which refreshes and sums up the findings made in the initial exercises.
There's a lot of fairytale magic in theater games for child participants as well.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the great coral reef is not a children’s performance, but a performance that adults and children co-operate in.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and common games also disperses the distance between adults and children.
The great coral reef is somewhat similar to the fairytale, fitness circuit and nature-related information strike, but finally it is tuned around visits in different, non-human spaces.
The great coral reef begins with exploring the business lines of coral and coral reef living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness districts teach the gestures of skates and seahorses, among others.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour is performed, with music, lights and shiny paints and costumes helping you to get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being considered.
In addition, we are living creatures looking at corals.
Looking and observing in many directions make the performance dense and life-long.
Whether to be the landscape of an organism, a landscape - looking organism, and another organism or landscape — and all of this at the same time.
For children, it does not seem to be difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives with its practices to reach the limits of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a quiet demonstration is held at Sitratori on behalf of endangered corals.
The destruction beyond man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, though it might be difficult to grasp the importance of exercising his own compassion toward the prospect of destruction.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for which it clears space for wonder and play.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives for intoxicants and sex because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the "boyfriend"'s house this weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs can't be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today’s children could have a decent childhood and would not have to grow up too early because of group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup in their pictures and reveal their clothes.
Snapchatt is used in the evenings to take and send revealing pictures.
Girls find it increasingly difficult to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and olders.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people thought about me.
Yle: Authorities informed the government that the case of Airisto Helmi has nothing to do with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Protection Police and Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation into Airisto Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reported by Yle.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on an ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here," Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's data, no evidence of any link to national security has been found so far in the seized material, but the investigation is only beginning.
There is no way of knowing what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewees states.
Extensive house searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is just about financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, evening magazine compiled a case that goes through arguments both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved the series Liverpool lost
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday is exactly the year that Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran off to a 1-0 guest victory.
Then the Pep Guardila combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, in turn, had a Wednesday fine league cup guest win from Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, from the very beginning, Hazard was involved.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgenho in a triangle game.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard crash forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed a complete left leg bet to the back lower corner.
Pool's Brazilian guard, Alison, was a little slow in her fight and got her fingertips into the ball.
Klopp certainly felt defeat status lightly unfair, as almost immediately after, Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's control from the finish line.
In the second period, the Chelsea Veskari Kepa also got into action.
The Basque watch quickly reacted to the draw of Sadio Mané and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into an angle kick.
At the other end, Alison, in turn, zeroed in throwing through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
However, Brass star's bull was directed toward national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
It couldn't take another 89th minute, either, when the switchman Daniel Sturridge was free to fire 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet in its honor to the top corner.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the league tip together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship fight with two points behind the tip.
The time-shifting conversation is filled with holes.
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked various Finnish influences what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only thing left in mind: the Nen terminal.
Some people's last name has a nen ending and some don't.
There's a divisional line that can be created anywhere, and here's one of the bidders.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the abolition of the annual clock shift.
Very many people agree that double-a-year shift of clocks has been a job for fools and has caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems at least to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing is now to decide at what time you end up at: the present summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinions on the Otakantaa.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
There is intense discussion at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
Wintertime defenders justify their position by the influence of morning light on people's well-being and summer time are defended by the influence of evening light on people's desire to outdoors and thus well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to research, the morning light rhythmizes a person's day and gives freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people's movement outside and provide better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard jobs.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather take both, but bad for our location in the northern part of the earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
Typical of the debate on the subject is that one's own vision is driven and the other's vision is very strongly opposed.
There is little to listen to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate because it does not require a great deal of attention and there is enough to justify it.
Similar types of issues are usually debated with the strongest and equally infertile.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I'm sure you can fit in with it.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close guest victory
Josba's first guest game in the hallbandy Divar produced a full three-point series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a triumph of 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1).
Nurmo still scored at the beginning of the third round, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, the brothers Eet and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-winning goal.
In both teams' stalls, crucial minutes were played in the equinox.
Josba's most powerful was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
Chain two was firepowered anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second line at the time of his goal.
After three series rounds, Josba has six points.
Next comes O2-Jyväskylä with guests in two weeks.
In the church of Eno on Sunday, the 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Uncle's church will be celebrated tomorrow in some very sad moods.
The arson of the Church of Excitement Danger a week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wants to do so, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10:00.
Then we move to the parish hall at the Karelian catering table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building under the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a retired parishmaster for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the church also marks the end of one era.
The parish house, already decommissioned, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in evasive quarters at the former municipal hall," says Markku Koistinen, a chaplain.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns from the position of leader of Tesla's government speech - Fraud charges were settled for $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company's CEO, Elon Musk, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC of the US Securities Market Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by a company he founded.
However, Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk is forced to step down from the position of Chairman of the Tesla Board for three years.
The company is forced to hire an external board president.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent managers and to monitor Muski's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peikin from the SEC.
The incident originated in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential contributors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue the company and Muski.
The SEC stated that it was calling for Musk to be fined and for him to no longer be in charge of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge frightened the investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in the Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency news agency AFP.
It is believed that the death toll will continue to increase, as the damage is in the process of being solved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the town of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Tsunam was given a warning immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being Plus.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already several people are known to have died.
Ruins of Requests for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the destruction site today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to still have 50-60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency leading the rescue work, reported that one person was excavated alive at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular hotel for business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would quickly be needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked out due to deficiencies in the application's encryption.
Interferences had access to the telephone numbers of ministers, among others.
It was an application used at the British Conservative Party convention in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, former Secretary of State, were the victims of harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the application's lack of encryption, the public was able to access politicians' profiles in the app, which were in the Conservative Party's annual meeting's mobile app.
The public had access to profiles by using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The profile login was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile for a moment to insult the porn picture and title.
Michael Goven's profile photo was changed to a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows to log on to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact details of the profile person and send messages in his name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party spokesperson apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application now works safely.
The British Data Authority (ICO) supports the data leak.
The application was developed by Australian Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in matters of security.
Every week, there are a large number of applauding Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland.
The keen-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The rapidly spread U.S. format, The Wall, was beached as a Finnish version for Four last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12-foot-high gaming wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, a studio audience of the program was raised in social media, who was bet on being Polish.
Twitter would stimulate discussion about whether Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, chief of the four domestic programs, illustrates the matter to Evening Magazine.
He says that the studio audience has close friends with players, other Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just as the audiences of The Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to various shows, Sormunen backgrounds.
He reminds us that following a game in itself is not so difficult, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish from each other.
However, for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters present to do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret as simultan interpretation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of slaps are being thrown there, for example, and what situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was delivered recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly given a simultan interpretation in his ear and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the shoots, the sum of the Ringune.
The typhoon, which has broken south of Japan, is moving towards the main islands, officials are warning of landslides and flooding.
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and there is no record of casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut from over 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there are also going to be heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces became darker and darker
It's been a bad season for the aces.
The sky was almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points for six rounds.
No Ässi defender or two lower chain player has yet scored.
The pressure is growing, too.
Against Sport, the audience was left the hall at the time of nearly half of the game left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried, because that's what we played weakly.
Especially the second-round performance was embarrassingly bad, Jarno Karki, who made the power 1+2 for Ace, told.
Sport naturally enjoyed winning.
The team had a game under it from Friday, so it would have thought it would show up in the making.
Maybe it did, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The bread-day mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the big hall stands.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Finnish Championships for Tractorikynnö were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were blocked fast before ten, the sellers reported that the products had stopped, the newsmear was sold more than 500 doses than before, and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard the rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
A particularly large number of programs for families with children could be accommodated in the morning and afternoon for five hours, which may have attracted them to a record number of locations.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach a further distance.
The sellers also curve to Liperi from a larger area every year.
This year, nearly one hundred rapporteurs, salesmen of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived in the breadkeeper.
The bread-day mother Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the number of audiences from the stands of the hall.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different types of bread arrived in the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsalainen, spent the day in the pie shop of the marts.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - from this you recognize a good lamp
Revive the space, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without tiring your eyes.
You might want to invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokinieemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do Your Eyes a Ministry
Lighting is growing in importance, the more years of age are behind it.
Adequate light can be used to help with the problems that many experience with age when the visual acuity is reduced and dazzling more and more people suffer.
Older, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore worth investing in the light handling effects and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Make Beauty Around You
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
Now the decorator can afford to choose.
The favourite is the non-living, Scandinavian and Japanese Japanese Japanese style.
On the other hand, modern and playful retro style with strong colours, metal with different shades or ice creams inspired by the 70s has also risen to the boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other interior decorations in the home.
Materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more investment is now being made in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a customized, bold luminaire with a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very designer-conscious," says Jokiniemi.
Not necessarily a latest trending lamp is purchased at home, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain types of timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kokoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of Kokoon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell are separated.
A Canadian attacker played a total of three League games in orange blacks without power points, Kookoo says in his press release.
O'Donnell moved to Kokoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played for KHL with Kunlund Red Star and KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no record of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - things go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic turns to paper
Game specialty Gameman now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of Stonefoot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All packages coming to us will be reusable.
We may use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in order to use it," says Ville Puurula of the Gameman of Oulu.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we should also move on to recycled material in envelopes.
The store wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It also provides financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is re-used.
Recycling is suitable for Gameman's operations naturally, as in addition to new products, the key product range of the shop includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion-conscious person: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work in a costume from one season to the next.
They create the basis for a good garderob with their multi-purposeness, as it is easy to assemble different costumes around quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most worn classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes the black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with polo collars can not have an incorrect purchase.
You can connect the garment to both straight trousers, blunt skirt and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a snotty style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylistic artist.
This is how you create a style.
The trendy look of the fall comes from golden brown and wide-footed corduroy pants, black polo sweater and gray ankles.
The classic polo knit, along with other classics, blue-green Scots-screen skirt and wine-red loafers, forms a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring the edge to the black polo sweater by combining it with casual trendy clothing: denim skirt, high boots and thick pantyhose.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet Union, sabotage activities were specialized in so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: a sabotage and reconnaissance group.
Agents operating in the Western countries of the Soviet Security Service, the KGB, have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, reports Vasili Mitroth (1922-2004) who defected to the west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
Targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups the uniforms and accessories of the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers for covert operations.
This trik was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
The agents of the Cold War period hid equipment kits with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
Still in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, which was detonated by a trap mine when it was sprayed by the authorities with a water cannon.
The police reached four drunk drivers in the province at night.
Police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Contio Bay blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanites at 4:30 a.m.
At Knee Lake's Kurevaarantie, the car derailed into ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew 1.54 per mil according to the police.
He didn't have any serious injuries during the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old male from outside driving a passenger car blew 1.33 per mil into the alcomometer.
Police suspect these male drivers of aggravated DUI and Kulvijärvi driver also of endangering road safety.

HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, the sports director of HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Philip Riska (central) has been important to the team in initiatives, underpower play and defensive role in field four.
Filip Riska, who played during the trial period in early autumn, continues in the HPK of Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underpower game, and in the defensive role of field four.
While there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola commented in the club's press release.
According to Toivola, the value of Risk will rise as the Ice Hockey League's solution games are played.
A central attacker from Pietarsaari, Riska, has played league hockey before in JYP, Lock and Sport.
Instead, the Pane Attacker Oskari Lehtinen was left without an agreement after a trial period.
True story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie was made based on them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 guidance is about the battle for survival, which has been dealt with in a grainy manner.
Tragedy has been made into movies... and documents... before.
Real events are also being investigated in this case.
22 years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by eye surgery performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost sight, which was why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that no one believed in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
However, like a miracle, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The worst-frozen Weathers were still thought to be dying and once again he was left to his own devices.
Clearly, against other expectations Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the film Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today the 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and in honor of the centenary year the whole family feast was prepared for Sunday.
The party began at 10 a.m. on Eno's church hill at the family fair, after which there have been provisions for a Karelian catering table at the Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the familymessoon.
Eno's vicar, Armi Iron Mountain, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work," says Iron Mountain (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Excitement Danger, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the parish of Eno.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu following the destruction of the Church of Excitement in the fire.
The Wood Church of Agitation Danger was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held in the heat of the fire, where the church was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-like fall storm crashed Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, is named Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Department has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show plenty of flooding all over Greece.
A video released on Twitter shows how between houses in the town of Kiato in the Corinthian region has suddenly appeared instead of the street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, heavy wind caused strong sea traffic.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The mission calls for the follow-up of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medicans occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September and October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The current storm left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concern in Greece has also been caused by refugee camps in islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
The storm will also be hit by areas destroyed by off-road fires around Athens in the summer.
The Medican also raged in Greece last November.
We must not go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the fall storm.
The sea trips are cancelled and even when walking, caution should be exercised to prevent branches or other bulk from flying into the storm.
These guidelines have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece during the weekend.
There is a need for instructions, as even the storm Zorbas, which is rising to the horrors, has been predicted to beat up the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in gusts up to 45 meters per second.
Heavy rains add to the despicability of the weather.
All those travelling to Greece via Solar Trips and Tui who have announced their telephone number have been warned about hard winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
Still, sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, Saturday by the beginning of the evening, holiday destinations have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and increased according to normal schedule.
Of course, we're watching the situation all the time.
We're ahead of security.
I supported media security officer Antonia Schroderus reports that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff on site.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me Saturday about the early evening.
In the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, there are currently over 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had been blazing on Rhodes and the temperature was up to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Solar Trips.
It is estimated that Zorbas will become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, for example," says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Huss have identical evening costumes in the Miss Finals - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the host Shirly Garvine.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and responded to the situation with laughter.
Garfield told the Evening Sanam he came in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get dressed on the plane.
Hussi serves as backstage and red carpet host in the Missi Finals, and he chats with incoming front-row stars.
Huss has a fresh move behind, since he moved from Kampu to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now. Let's see what happens.
Essentially, the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful," Hussi says.
Shirly Garvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnering the curious eyes of pensioners
The host and Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen of 2016 reported on the red carpet of the Miss Suomi final that she had had enough to do with radio plots and Love Island Finland descriptions.
There has been so much urgency that Garvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I did make-up and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
In the evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says he pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
Well, at least everyone else thought it was funny to make-up.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
At Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Garvinen says he enjoyed his job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience to date as also stopping.
Garfield says he went to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are people's genuine feelings, Garvinen describes the feelings of singles in the show.
How am I supposed to wear the extra-generation boots?
Three perfect example costumes
Classic clothes are garments that work from one season to the next in costume.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be accommodated.
A few years ago, over-generation boots that became the hit shoes of the fall and winter season have gone nowhere.
According to their name, boots that reach the knee repeat in style from year to season.
Appearing boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth a try, no - brave.
Indeed, the boots of the generation fit in any type of outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, blunt or tight, the simple leather or composition leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in the party log as well as in everyday costumes.
Black super-generational boots are well suited for even delicate outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plicher skirt and tender, mush knit.
A fresh but autumnly stylish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created by long copper-brown velvetwork, over-generation boots, spectacular earrings and a staple little bag.
Although over-generation boots have a certain refinement, they also fit perfectly into a casual everyday dress along with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy capak.
It's so easy and still so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
The Otaniemi robotic cars play a role as a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will determine how robotic cars fare on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in the real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, traffic management manager.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 in charge of robotic traffic development.
Robot cars run throughout the fall three days a week: Tuesdays 13-15:30, Wednesdays 10-15, and Thursdays 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops are identified by stop markings.
The safest way to get aboard is by stopping number 1.
The bassist of the mokoma band fell off the stage in the middle of the show and was injured
The Mokoma band announces an unexpected situation on their Facebook pages at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The Mokoma band's show at the Tampere Pakkahuonet took a dramatic turn on Saturday when band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the evening.
The twilight's wrist was broken.
The band will inform you on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped yesterday at the Packroom from the stage in the final song and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done with backup, the website will read.
The fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist-Santtu lies plaster in hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, it was quite a worry that how bad it was to be.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones heal over time.
Check out and quick recovery for Santa and a good tour of the rest of the band plus a replacement!
And thanks for last night, the great gig was, but you promise to leave out such a strong dramatic show in the future, right?
Police oversaw hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's wilderness contact persons reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of control was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons and the permitted rounds of self-loading weapons used in the poultry bird were checked.
According to police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit during the surveillance.
12 daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unlicensed catches.
In addition, the police blew 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them are suspected of DUI.
In addition, patrols handled five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters are very much in compliance with the warrant for hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
The mute goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Home Secretary Kai Mykkänen (Kokke) travels to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN Refugees Organisation (UNHRC) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen also meets with the NGOs of the Turkish Interior Minister, Süleyman Soylu and Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
We're talking about raising the quota.
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but there has since been no government agreement to increase it.
The Coalition has advocated a quota increase, but the project has most recently fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to 1,500 to 2,000 people a year.
The silent visit during this reign is the first that the Home Secretary makes on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Ministers Petteri Orpo (kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to the wrong places. You don't know if you're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday, a Karelian reported a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill in principle prohibits, as farm animals, pets or other business activities, the keeping of all animals not specifically permitted by ministerial regulations.
So, in principle, everything else is prohibited except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, it should mean that we are abandoning in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security or good manner of society.
In principle, we are now introducing a ban on any activity that the law or regulation does not specifically permit.
This change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, or done until a law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
The government's activity in lawmaking in general has been weak.
If we go on the road that, in principle, everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But a legal project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is forbidden, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a sensible minister who will suspend the progress of such a law project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of the fall
This autumn's trendy clothing comes in snake bumps.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Combine the snake-shrink skirt into a pair of the more restrained upper parts, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn there is plenty of silk, and silk skirt in particular is one of the most trendy clothing items in the season.
Combine the gorgeous silk skirt with a refined upper female or casual knit.

For example, the combination of squares and ballwork is beautiful.
Asymmetric pearls are a breeze of light summer, which can be taken with them into autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetric hem is feminine and playful and is perfect for everyday life as well as for celebration.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere's arms
In the family picture of the Karalahtis, a sweet three-month-old baby named Alexia rises to the center of attention.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day-care centre established for Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Yere Karalahti, 43, received family additions in early July.
The first-born Jax boy of the couple turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, which included the entire Karalahti family.
On Instagram, Nanna published a picture of the Spanish moods where the entire Karalahti family pose.
Kids Jax and Alexia are in their parents' arms.
The attention is drawn to the sweetly sulking baby Alexia, who rests in the arms of his father Jere.
Thank you for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, writes along the side of the Nanna Karalahti family portrait.

In addition to the Karalahtis, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and the breeder Hanna Liisant.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the day care centre.
Turkey is urged to load mobile phones in case of storm
The storm Zorba that blew up in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned on Saturday especially the seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
The disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens from the early evening on Saturday to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the internet connection worked so that people could receive current status updates, says the local news agency Anadalu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture, for example, out of the way of the wind.
A heavy rain is expected for Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28 to 33 meters per second.
In Greece, a red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather bulletins and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, the wind was up there, and it was raining.
People were calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in distress either.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, reported the local news agency Amna.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled Saturday, reported from travel agencies to STT.
According to the Finnish delegation in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst contestant Mercedes was too hard a piece in Russian GP times.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but there's no big deal.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-drived, and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, clearly left out of Mercedes speed, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari was already having a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
The raider was asked why the sudden fall from Mercedes' ride was caused.
They seem to be going faster than we are. That's how simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare delicacy was seen in the time-times for Sauber of Räikkönen's future stable.
Charles Leclerc, replacing Räikkönen in Ferrari next season, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time-drive session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place to leave is best for more than three years.
And while in the second driving session as many as five drivers failed to drive altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkönen in view of the future?
Yes, if compared to where they were in the early season, the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed on steady terms.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he did not get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius controls the match with his hard series, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in clearly better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left foot.
The hit was so hard that the guy who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius aired quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish promoters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the match.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
There might be a chance to even get to the World Cup match, Helenius commented to the Evening Journal before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This won't get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian magazine, the vice president of the country urges that preparations be made for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the port city of Palu and its neighboring municipality, Donggala.
So far, all victims are Palus, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that the rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they heard the cries of the people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, has ordered an army to rescue and clear.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as in the disaster area, electricity and communications are cut off in many places.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Suomi finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh remake
A new Miss Finland is currently being selected at Billnäs's Ruukki.
In the interview round, a question was asked to each Miss Finalist.
The finalists drew the question of a glass bowl on stage.
Especially the hesitant response of the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused sweet but benevolent laughter in the audience present.
The question asked to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before starting with hesitation.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said, thinking.
A pause for reflection in the audience caused laughter to occur until Anttikoski continued to reply:
The last book I've ever read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his response, Anttikoski received a fresh applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the miss tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, as he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland of 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m. when the crown is abandoned by Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm of last year.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, acidic apples from behind, for the domestic apple is a shocking price in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pear.
Of course, the taste will be more diverse if the pear is also added to the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed cocoons.
Slice.
You can melt in a pot.
Bald the eggs and sugar into foam and then add cornmeal and melt butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch as maize and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Cover the bread dish with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the dish, and spread pear slices on top of sugar.
Sponge half the dough over the pear slices and the apple lobes over the dough.
Sponge the rest of the dough over the apple lobes.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let cool in the pan and then overturn on the serving dish.
Just cut the cake properly when it's cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbs easily because the dough has almond and cornmeal with no gluten in it.
Ruka holds an international crime literature event in January
In January, the first international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held in Kuusamo Ruka.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary-related program numbers and jazz music.
Among the literary guests of the festival are Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish detective literature, and Jerker Eriksson, the Swedish duo behind Erik Axel Sund, and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, the event also includes writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analysed the matter have outlined two species of "coolity" of slightly different features: generally attractive coolness and, in its part, opposite dissident-cooly.
Attractively, according to the researchers ’ description, cool people had many socially desirable features: they were outwardly oriented, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion, and edge.
They craved experiences and cared little for outside assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardy in the longer term is not cool: high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success in later life.
So reports an American study published in Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought the popularity of good-looking people, and sought out the popularity of others, had an increased risk as young adults of using intoxicants and falling into crime.
In their relationships, they were less able to cope than their once inconspicuous peers.
High-status lukewarms, designer bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with ordinary supermarket shirts than with those wearing a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand shirt when they visited.
If you're in the Greek resort islands, watch out!
There's a typhoon coming up, and the weather warning is calling out red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland during the average six months.
The storm Zorbas hits Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported in the weather service Foreca's blog.
According to it, the roughest gusts in the storm are as high as 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that struck Finland from the beginning of the week blew more than 31 metres per second.
According to the blog, however, the biggest concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
On the weekend in southern Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water can come.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland, drooled by men?
Appears in confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, Aku, a beauty drooled by several men, also appears in strange 2010 YouTube videos as an artist.
On videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among others, to produce an octopus from an old paper mill.
Anku also shows her sympathetic style how to work a hedgehog with the right spikes.
Now let's make Easter weeds grow, but let's do it a little unexpectedly, Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, pantyhose, and freshwood seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch videos from below or from Ankun YouTube from here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and bursted with adrenaline in Sochi, does he have to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a few more minutes after his Russian gp pole drive while he was in front of the media.
The fine round left Mercedes' first star Lewis Hamilton behind and was surely mentally important to the Finnish driver who collected criticism this season.
It's a nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the solution round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so it's been a long time.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good rounds again.
It's not easy to miss the Sochi track, so it's a particularly big role to take off.
And of course, Bottas was allowed to answer questions as to whether he would drive tomorrow for victory or whether he would be facing the World Cup title of the approaching Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' management to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so you keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas' success after the drive, and the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed what he saw.
Lewis had a plan to beat Valtter, but he didn't make it to the 7th.
Valtteri knows he's got to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff glowed.
To the question whether the stables allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive honestly, Wolff responded dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitelainen Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series rarely ended.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in the closing rally around Turku and Salo by Tuusula residents Eerik and Henrik Saint Petersburg, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen of Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed the Finnish Championship for him from the SM4 class of two-wheeled cars.
Kinnunen and map reader Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started the Turku sectional competition with a moderate, because the starting points were clear: an investment in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the duo had to give a handicap when some of the extra lights cheated on another special experiment.
It was a pretty blind spot for a third piece.
In a situation like that, you don't want to get lost.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was followed, Kinnunen told.
Syria urges the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the war that has continued for seven years.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel reported on Friday in Germany that a meeting with Syria is scheduled for October with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey in addition to her.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but dozens of millions of Americans watched Supreme Court Judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassing him, got exceptionally many people by the screens.
In the United States, the appointment drama of a Supreme Court judge in full power received at least 20 million people to attend his televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, California professor of harassment, were in front of the Senate judicial committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the consultations were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, the online consultation followed several millions more.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported having made its record of the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN's figure will rise by more than 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made a start of 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are channel-specific, TV viewers are derived from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they will in any case be dizzy.
Few reach 20 million.
In the United States, more than 20 million viewers usually get only sports matches and the great Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The most watched annual show in the United States, for the NFL final match in the American Football League, Super Bowl, is certainly a journey.
This year, the Super Bowl collected around 103 million people on NBC at the screens.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was viewed by Nielsen by a total of nearly 48 million people and the inauguration of more than 30 million people.
Top priority
The Supreme Court's appointment as a judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then president Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican executive Ronald Reagan, but he was on a number of issues in the so-called scale language, whose vote could determine the position of a nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights and, for example, in 2015 decided by his vote that same-sexers gained marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative on his heels.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court's conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see the health records of their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, of course, the situation in Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of infants.
The situation was temporarily described as a correction in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to repair.
Now we're in the process of repairing in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a run-through case.
Then the layman’s understanding is about the push of the button: now that the cord is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his information if he or she has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds have?
An ID card is subject to a fee, and a ten-year-old can't even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of the fourth grader in primary school except by asking for it in print.
It is not so much a question of parental rights as of children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child’s care that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even underage people can have family situations where not all things can be spoken freely.
Often they are related to sexual health, and free care of which is deeply relevant human rights.
In the United States, the FBI began to clean up harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
According to American media, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani
The caught brawler continued to gluttony even in the chamber.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "sacrify."
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night of Saturday in Kajaani.
Officials report an incident that originated when a well over 30-year-old man vexed a violent dispute at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When the third party intervened, the man struck him as well.
The triple abuse led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police report.
The suspect was still acting aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they sent a man to a police prison to "sacrify."
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Grant organizations are preparing to start work on the Indonesian Sulawes - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information for Finland's Unicef.
The local authorities are conducting rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawes rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala area a little further north the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections are not working.
The relief measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often light-built, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection... for example tents... and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
The first thing most people can do is provide water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in storage.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported to the first emergency by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and joining families is one part of Unicef's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, previously raised funds will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started a fundraising effort to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as chairman of Tesla's board of directors, ends a $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies manufacturing space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges in agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk terminates his duties as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of an agreement he signed with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, causing the company's share price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair the Tesla Board of Directors for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communication.
Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fines, the Tesla company also has to pay 20 million similar fines to the financial supervisor.
The tweets led investors astray
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange to become a private limited company.
Billionaire tweets say the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420 in stock.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by over ten per cent in a day, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the overseer, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday of this week, the course fell by 14 percent when the SEC reported a fraud charge.
It is expected that the agreement on the news will strengthen the company's course again.
The Last Sentence Is No Reason
Of course, the bells of the Cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: while the church crypt would be exorcised and the organ would play by itself.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some part has broken down and a new part is expected, says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
It is stated in the account that the final sentence is not the reason for the stoppage of the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
