In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will also be concentrated in four Ely centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Ely in Mikkeli is responsible for the operation.
According to the new Business Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund aid must no longer be targeted at large companies unless it is a whole new activity.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants are also counted as large municipalities.
Instead, EU support can continue to be granted for investments to improve the conditions of the local economy.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the unit managing EU and national subsidies will be about 30 people.
At least for the time being, they will all continue their work at their current offices.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Ely Centre in Ely Centre in Etelä-Savo, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now striving for in Ukraine
Russia is consistent, even if it does not always seem so.
Director of the National Defence College Strategy Department, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by Monday morning's conflicting Ukraine news.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratroopers are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received reinforcements (read more here).
Mr Lavrov insisted that an immediate cease-fire be established without conditions in the negotiations in Minsk.
Russia denies that it is involved and immediately needs to achieve the result of the negotiations in order to establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big picture: we must suddenly start negotiating, and precisely so that Russia gets its own grip on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources passenger services to the Norwegian company, lay off people
Finnair begins to purchase cabin services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement first covers Finnair's Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but is due to be extended later.
Outsourcing of two routes leads to a reduction of around 100 person-years in Finland, which is carried out in the first phase with layoffs, the company reported in a press release.
In addition, some 80 Asian temporary workers stop working as the routes are outsourced.
As early as June, Finnair announced that it intends to outsource approximately 20 routes in the next two years.
Externalisations were concluded when no agreement was reached with the staff on savings.
Externalisations are scheduled to start in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation with other partner candidates will continue as well.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve - related back pain, or sciatica, by those doing heavy shift work.
The Finnish Institute of Occupational Health survey followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection between sleep disorders and sciatica trees is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
Firefighters' good muscle strength and endurance condition, which are regularly tested, do not appear to protect from pain, says research director, Docent Sirpa Lusa in a bulletin from the Department of Occupational Health.
Firefighters' work is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Destroying other apartments easily
Water damage Water damage is certainly not always caused by a leaking pipe or tap, a reminder of an expert at the hosting union.
We have been contacted when the breakage of the aquarium has caused water damage in the house company that it is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furujelm, a legal expert of the hosting union.
Furuporjelm points out that not only pipes and sewers are the common cause of water damage, but also today more and more new machines such as ice-burning machines have caused water leaks in dwellings.
Many people are not aware that machines such as a washing machine or washing machine must not be left unsupervised.
The tap must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, otherwise pressure in the pipes may lead to water leakage.
A resident may be regarded as guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case liability for damages rests with the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for damage, depending on the terms and conditions of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the occupant has caused the damage due to negligence, the person has liability.
If the occupant has passed out in the shower on top of the floor well, it can often be proved that the neglect has been caused by water flooding elsewhere in these cases and the janitor comes to an apartment where a extinguished resident can be found.
Furuporjelm reports that due to the widespread exhaustion of floor wells, many student dwellings have now been fitted with two floor wells in shower facilities.
Water damage has also been caused by waterbeds, though not to the extent that they were more popular in the past.
Even a dog’s water cup and the downfall of a home wine vessel can become real water damage.
I also know a case in which there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage, Furupohjelm says.
The principle of liability for damages always goes the same way if the company's statutes do not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and damage to the structure of the building company and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage easily causes damage to other dwellings, as the structure of concrete absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuporjelm, battery leaks in dwellings are particularly difficult because batteries leak easily insidiously into structures.
Water damage can now be caused by more widespread air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or rainwater network, not just a container.
The partner is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
Furuporjelm advises that even if the house company rules do not require, for example, a fixed exhaust hose for a washing machine, insurance may be subject to a condition which is why the compensation is not received.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I believe that the washing machines' loose drainage pipes, e.g. in the bathtub, are a big risk, which have caused many damage.
I recommend that the drains should always be brought in solidly into the sewage system.
Loss of snow and water on the balcony
Control of the washing machine, washing machine, etc., with them on.
Closure of water taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible twice in six months.
The recommendation is to connect the drains to the sewers in a solid way.
Check the faucets and their potential leakages
Regular freezer thawing

FC Honka lost again and cast a serial jumbo
At Tapiola Sports Park, on Sunday night, the two weakest teams of the football Betting League were faced with the fitness barometer of this moment.
In June, FC Honka, who celebrated victory, hosted the Vaasa Ball Society that sailed in a seven-game winning streak.
The VPS just took its previous win against Honka in July.
Meeting Sunday with the Espooan team came to a good seam, as the VPS returned to the winning stock for a long time by reading 2-1.
Vaasan head coach Olli Huttunen complained before the game about his team's inefficiency, but the confused Honka defense eased the VPS's goalmaking problems.
Gameically very nervous performance.
We couldn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't hold the ball," Huttunen reviewed his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's top two Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both vase goals were created as a result of loose play by toppers.
The opening goal of the match was seen only after a five-minute game when Steven Morrissey directed the Honka goalkeeper Walter Viitalan, who was jogged past the shot by Sebastian Strandvall.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the time of the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial shock, the Espoans got their game together and ran the ball at the head of attack.
In particular, midfielder Carlos Portela and winger Roni Reindeerka were eager to search for locations, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to scoring was Honga's midfielder Jussi Hammer, whose shot from 20 metres was however slightly past the VPS goal.
The VPS effectively attacked using its witty attackers and Honga's messed-up pair of tops.
At half an hour, the Vasaans scored a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached a two-way drive.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was in an opening episode with a good game head and repeatedly created situations on his left flank.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for Espoian defense throughout the game.
"I cried at halftime that if you lose, then you lose with honor," Kuqi told.
In the second period, the detachment Honka ran wildly for the narrowing goal.
The team was twice close to a hit until the third attempt succeeded.
The Pane Attacker Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to even the match.
The Espoo team was taking more and more risks, which allowed VPS to engage in dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were once pecked with Viitala, but Honka goalkeeper's sparkly rejections kept the home team involved in the game.
Towards the end, Honka got a little tired, and couldn't score any more goals.
With the loss, Honka cast the bet league last, while there are still seven games left in the series.
Journal: Putin threatened to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite loud in a telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, says Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Mr Putin expressed his annoyance at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica tells me Putin said so.
According to the paper, Putin's message to Mr Barroso was this: Don't annoy Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave Russian television number one an interview on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict to be completely within Ukraine and that he would call on the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev very much about the shooting of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by" if people are shot to death at close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The work of the actor destroyed the family
Rough work The Conkar actor and the theater family raised a recognition of how his first marriage was destroyed by the acting profession.
Actor Esko Roine turns 70 next Friday, but I think he has a valid saying that age is only a number.
I don't see any difference compared to one year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
Mental puberty seems to continue, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but she's still working for a lot of men.
It was sometimes joked that not many plays were made in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment Roinee has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre play How to be successful in business, Tampere's Worker Theatre's Mind-approver, and Tampere's Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine is also seen in the upcoming Ricky Rapper film.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career didn't start out promisingly.
I didn't qualify for Tierna Boy at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the business that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army just to get into theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatrical roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how to count.
If you count work like Englishmen that every part of the TV series is your own show, there are over 600 TV stories.
I was three years in New Day, three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko's older sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and make the wild roles as an anarchist grandmothers in Tampere's Workers Theatre yet to make time.
My little brother's gonna be hanging out on stage for years to come.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about a guy this age.
I always have to take a little reservation to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
The years have also left their mark on the man.
Age doesn't come alone.
The knees have been operated, the hip whistles and the osteoarthritis troubles, but when you don't let it get too disturbed, yes, with these on your head, Esko Roine says.
For the TV audience, Roine became familiar with e.g.
For pirate radio and one of the quizs where he and Antti Einio shared hundreds of dollars.
It was Antti Einiö, who shared crops.
I tried to tell you that they were hundreds, not harvests.
In the Rhineman series, Roine was a pointless Inspector Iron Rock.
He became the favourite of the Tampere policemen, in the department when he happened to be a lieutenant of the same kind.
A cop stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled to me, "That Iron Rock is great!"
Working group successful
The theatre works have left Roine in mind, for example.
Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre of Helsinki, the death of the Kauppava Traveller of the Tampere Workers Theatre and the Long Day Trip to the Night of the Tampere Theatre.
All of them involve the fact that performances have been popular.
It is not my fault that the task force has succeeded.
There's been some rhinestones.
Pekka Woodhead's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is that I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome isn't satisfying myself or the viewers.
As a line actor, you can't choose your own jobs.
It's just a nice thing to do what you've been told.
Along with theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was an educational experience.
It didn't work out at all when I tried to be the administrative director, actor and then a restaurant manager at the Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that there was no way to reconcile these two.
Typical was that when the show was running out or in the middle and I was already wondering if I was going to turn on the sauna, the restaurant became a call that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the performance.
Memoirs for Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roineen appears memoirs, ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've caused some kind of a bump from the facial wrestler's memories.
When I was playing Zoom, they used to call me a face-wrestler.
I didn't know them by name.
The book has been made for years.
At one time, Roine told me that there is no news bomb coming, because he has not done anything so grumpy, or if so, he will not.
I wrote a little introductory phrase for the book.
In that, I say that if anyone is expecting scandal-stricken revelations or good gossip, it is worth stopping reading here.
There's a lot of professional stuff in there, as an actor as a theater director.
The publisher boasts that there is also a sport of hilarious theater schooling there.
It was a pretty normal college life, but when I was a kid, there were all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was in Turka's day.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got there than self-confidence, that once the school's gone so far as to know that at least it's not up to it if it doesn't get any better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I'd gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann, and Hannes Häyrinen, and I was able to work with them.
There were legends there from my first father-in-law, Charles Halttute.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martin, was with me on the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine faced his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
As a painful thing, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to mother and son to me.
I did not think that was a good solution, and I understand that children now agree quite a bit as adults.
In theater circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In my case, some part was that I worked a lot back then.
I was in the theater on almost every case.
Then there was the TV and the radio on it.
I did a long day, and family life suffered.
On the day of the party, maybe a night off.
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers' Theatre on September 7.
The celebration continues at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a man who's making his mind feel bad, too.
I was 50 years old at work and 60 years old at work.
When such an easy - moving play occurred, I thought we would now keep the seventy - year - olds, so we could get them off with one throttle.
Roine says there's no party ceremony on the actual birthday.
As I recall, it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have booked a gig for that day.
Or it's a strange night off that I'm going to have on the night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the supply chain
Some of Britain's smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain are currently enjoying an unexpected number of aircraft and engine development plans implemented at the same time.
Aviation and Defence
At the same time, while some enjoy the order cap, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems at hand in the production chain and the price pressure.
"It is quite true that there is price pressure, especially now that the production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing approximately 240 North-West England aircraft suppliers, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production facilities and machines needed to realise these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Churchill, which produces the wings of gas turbines, the company has a "challenged time" behind it when several new building plans began to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very little production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we also had to try to tighten up.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators in the sector believe that more investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if the UK wants to retain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
The chairman of Ford Aerospace and Geoff Ford, a fine mechanics engineer from Tyneside, says that the order sum should increase producers' confidence and willingness to expand and increase production capacity, as there will be enough work to do.
"If this does not happen, we will lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
A number of large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a company manufacturing aircraft and engine parts in the FTSE 250 index, purchased UPECA, which manufactures parts of a Malaysian aircraft, for £75 million.
MB Aerospace acquired companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in reality the production is slowed down by the limited design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has passed on to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, Director of the GKN Aircraft Production Unit, who is also a representative of the British aircraft trade, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"Volume is more important than introducing new technologies and advanced processes," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more cautious so as not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it came into great difficulty when the company lost and the factories and production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's aircraft manufacturing unit, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain that supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to manufacture the jet aircraft's engine.
"The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and by keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare for more activity," Wood says.
According to Boeing CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
The CEO of the Airbus passenger jet manufacturing unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists is not going to succeed, and our job is to try to prevent this situation as well as support journalists and look for alternatives, but there are big problems to expect," Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is my job, as well as Airbus's."
Hong Kong demonstration groups begin an era of "citizen disobedience" with Beijing banning open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Activists supporting democracy spread out on the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups stress that demonstrations can flare up and vow to ensure that the city will begin a "day of civil disobedience" to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese government regarding the elections.
Thousands of protesters braved the coming rain as rushes against Hong Kong's shining horizon as they walked into a demonstration organized by the pro-democracy Occupy Central group in front of the Council's premises for the enforcement of laws on Sunday night.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny voters the right to publicly propose candidates in the 2017 mayorial election, thus defying months of protests that further increase the division of the city.
Protesters participate in the start of the Occupy Central movement demonstration in front of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections," says 24-year-old website administrator Dion Tse, who participated in a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government has no respect for the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
China's highest law-making body, the People's Congress of China, approved plans for electoral changes, allowing only two to three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
The nomination, however, requires the approval of a 1200-person nomination committee, and opposition politicians feel that this will effectively prevent the disparate political views from being made available to the ballots.
Protesters participate in a demonstration organized in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
Police estimate that more than 2,600 people were currently participating in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when about 100 protesters led by the Scholarism student group gathered late Sunday at the Grand Hyatt, where Communist Party member Li Fein was to stay after his arrival in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not say the exact date on which roadblocking takes place, but urged participants to follow closely the development of the situation "within the next couple of weeks", while adding that the city will officially move to "a period of civil disobedience".
Benny Tai will answer the press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in a Sunday demonstration, standing in front of a billboard of two figures representing disobedience in China.
That person is taking over the center with you!
A 17-year-old conventioner representing Scholarism, Joshua Wong, said earlier that the preparations for the demonstrations of high school students are underway and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Li Fei, the Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending the "international demands" of universal suffrage is "a waste of time" and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to "mixed society and mislead it."
"Unpractical proposals such as naming a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, demanding that the electoral process should be created in such a way as to fit the actual situation and legal framework of each society.
The bill on universal suffrage can only be adopted as a law if a large majority, or two thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, supports it, which means that the 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong might be drawn into prolonged political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
"It would harm business life and the development of the city," he says.
Nearly 800,000 people voted in an informal poll organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands, and according to the demands, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
As many as 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the march of 17 August for Beijing and against Occupy Central attracted around 88,000 participants. Estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the estimates of police and organizers differ considerably from these figures.
Three wounded by lightning strikes on the New York beach
In a lightning strike at a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night, when heavy storms ran across the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
Lightning struck when heavy thunderstorms swept over the city.
Storm rains, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations and U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the East River Island.
Tens of commercial flights to city airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not supposed to please
This is the latest guidance for employees and managers of network users, and is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is recognized by such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
While a historian at Harvard, Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as a university principal, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message across widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news online does not mean that the internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they would solve the problem in cooperation, even though they actually worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between the two units, performance expert Dave Paradi advises to forget Microsoft's SmartArt and instead use Diagrammer.com, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Cainar surgery at Mount Stuart Hospital under ban due to a safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily suspended from office, and the UK National Health System NHS stopped directing patients to cataract surgery at that private hospital after the hospital problems were raised.
Two people applied to Torbay Hospital for emergency care after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that it had been associated with 19 patients in treatment on July 26 and invited them to a "urgent clinical examination".
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized and said that the matter has begun to be investigated since the doctor was dismissed.
The matter came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated at Mount Stuart sought emergency care because of eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were investigated on the same day, have needed a correction surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not directed patients to treatment in Mount Stuart since the problem arose.
David Sinclair, interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients involved quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the care provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its permit issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, head of patient safety at the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, "patient safety is always top priority, so it is important that these cataract surgery is not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
The Ramsay Health Care UK company, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, apologized " sincerely to all patients who had complications".
The company was announced that "as soon as we found out about a potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital were called all the patients in question".
This specialist has had a treatment permit for Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgery in various parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the operations he performed have been excellent, and the complication rate has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended until the case has been examined.
What's "4chan"?
The notorious anonymous messaging site was the first to release leaked nude photos of celebrities.
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published stolen photos?
"4chan" was established in 2003 and is a communication site that sparked the debate, which is as much barked at as it is praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called notice boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online platforms, users do not create one profile that is constantly used and their publications are not kept.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute as they are displaced by more recent releases at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known memes on the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or even criminal content on the site.
The site's most popular notice board is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly published with NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may contain tame porn, but also brutal and shocking images. An anonymous hacker released stolen photos of celebrities specifically on this bulletin board this weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer medicine research and development
The goal of CytRx is to cure cancer – or at least slow it down.
The company producing biological drugs in Los Angeles, which recently became the target of a disturbance caused by the power sales of shares, specializes in research and development of anticancer medicines.
The most promising medicine is aldocosorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials with aldocosorubicin in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas, AIDS-associated Kapos sarcomas and recurrent glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It is a controlled missile, as it were, that passes directly into the tumour and not into the rest of the body, says Steven Kriegsma, CEO of CytRx, from aldoxorubicin, an anticancer medicine.
Aldocosorubicin contains so-called compound technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates in the tumors, causing the medicine to pass directly into the cancer cells.
I donated the medicine only in an acidic environment, or cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more and more doses of the anticancer medicine.
"It's like a missile that goes directly into the tumor and not into the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on developing medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year and thus raised $86 million to maintain operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide in a pivotal 3-stage clinical trial for alternative therapy of soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles, and fatty tissue.
Alternative therapy is used in cancer treatment when the initial treatment does not produce results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for authorisation as early as 2016, Kriegsman says.
The medicine could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data released by CytRx from a previous clinical trial in December showed that aldocosorubin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was "we have not seen any clinical data on how much it differs from the medicine itself," says H.C. Wainwright & Co. investment firm analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of pharmaceuticals to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money will be invested to find that one gold vein, and the placement will continue until that gold vein is found," he says.
Money is spent on research and development so long as the medicine is successfully commercialised.
Several shareholders have sued CytRx because they felt that it gave a better picture of their success than reality.
In the complaints, the company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group company in charge of investment relations, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another company in the biotechnology sector for articles published on websites such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that he removed articles "that were contrary to practice".
Several articles on the company were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to answer the lawsuits.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who tend to seek employment in biotech centers such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Views of Analyst
The price of CytRx's shares rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when allegations of advertising the shares became public.
According to Analyst, lawsuits and negative publicity have reduced the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure there's any easy way to bypass this thing as long as the concept is valid."
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of filming
The photographer of the True Events-based Act in the name of Finland also died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting.
The cameraman filmed a shooting between an Omaha police patrol and a person suspected of armed robbery at a fast-food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from the injuries he sustained.
Police reported, according to the TMZ website, that a person suspected of armed robbery died in the shooting, in addition to a cameraman.
A series in the name of the Law has been aired in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been aired on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an external factor arises in the court hearing that began today on Ulvila's death.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal is now dealing with the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court with new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Appeal is that the judgment will still be handed down this year.
The Court of Appeal of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening statement, the engagement attorney Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecution's view of the night of the murder and of the things that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether an outsider has entered the house who has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and in time told by Anneli Auer.
It is a question of the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and apply for divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife," Kulmala described on Monday the night of the killing.
According to the prosecution, a number of factors prove that there was no external agent present.
For example, there are no sounds from the emergency voice recording.
Auer's eldest child... daughter told me during the interrogation that she saw the perpetrator when the man left the door of the fireplace.
The liberating judgment given by the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's account.
According to the prosecution, the daughter's findings cannot be true.
"The daughter didn't see an outsider in the parents' bedroom, although she visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is just connected to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has reported the events since the night of the murder at the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing the daughter told at the hospital was that she only saw Lahti's body while visiting the murder site in the fireplace.
Auer's defense plans to present to the court lines of investigation, which the defense says have not been sufficiently investigated by the police.
Three years ago, when the Vaasa Court of Appeal was acquitted by Auer, the court considered the DNA of a foreign man found in the halo as a reference to an external factor.
The sample later proved to be DNA of a researcher working in the Central Crime Police Laboratory
At that time, a sample of 700 individuals was taken as a mass sample of DNA.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded," defense attorney Juha Manner said.
One of the new witnesses in the defense tells of a possible outside factor.
The Ulvilan woman told the police about a bourgeoisist who had confessed to the act according to the woman.
The police questioned him this summer.
The prosecution ruled that the bourgeoisie had nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecution made an inquiry into the woman, as the prosecutor suspects that the woman had lied in her report.
One of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who worked at the Central Hospital of Satakunta on the night of the murder.
The District Court of the Hundredkunta sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the District Court's ruling, the possibility of an external author was contested by, among other things, the reports of the children of Auer, the voice of the emergency centre recording, as well as the time required for the course of events, is missing from the external author.
Sentence came with a vote of 2-1.
A minor judge wrote that, in criminal cases, conflicting evidence must be interpreted in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s account must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions of the account, she had found an outsider leaving the door of the fireplace room.
The two oldest children of Auer have been called to the Court of Appeal.
The daughter was first heard personally last year at the District Court of Satakunta.
When heard in court, he no longer remembered what happened the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named her mother's killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me in front of him what happened the night of the murder behind a closed door.
He also reported that Auer planned to kill for six months.
As a plaintiff, the son has no obligation to make a statement in court.
The court hearing continues today with a hearing by Anneli Auer.
If necessary, Auer's hearing will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him many first enemies.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is discussing intensely whether his entry should be allowed or not.
The Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in the summit, attended by more than 4,000 representatives from the most influential countries in the world.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting in our opinion," Maria Alyokhina said to the audience at Sydney's fully packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the brink of a "perfect war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new Russia".
Tony Abbott has said he's weighing the decision.
According to Mike Callaghan, head of the G20 unit at the Lowy Institute Research Centre, Australians cannot decide who attends the meeting, even though the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it lets into the country, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just as New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted International Monetary Fund meetings, "it's not up to the host to deny someone invited to come," Callaghan says.
The previous week, Tony Abbott said he was "pressing the decision" after Russia's reprehensible actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
As Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on this issue alone.
"However, this is an important issue that I will weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so in the next few weeks," he says.
People participate in an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, East Ukraine.
The event will take two days, involving a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest emerging economies, with a total of about two thirds of the world's population, accounting for 85% of world GDP and 75% of international trade.
The members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given a questionable task of balancing various interests under great public pressure.
He felt that the prime minister's best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to explain his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures to be seen.
I think the world is waiting for them to bring these things up.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk airport for an attack on Ukrainian military bases in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Put's meeting will take place, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing Putin has in mind.
He hardly states that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Opposition leader Bill Shorten views Putin's entry into Australia with "very reservations", but understands that it is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other states and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines crash, and the lack of pity, responsibility and proper cooperation in connection with the plane crash, completely and now, with thousands of Russian soldiers swarming on the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians are very sceptical about welcoming Putin to Australia.
The German business community criticizes "self-satisfying" Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become "too confident" and "self-sufficient", as government policy threatens the country's hard-earned competitiveness.
The criticism of the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel coincides with the fact that Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowdown, causing concern about its ability to run economic growth in a stagnant euro area.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of political decisions strongly opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the reduction in the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
"I think the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world's largest chemical manufacturer.
The EU economy
He says this: "On the whole, there is a feeling that we are doing well, that we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level. So what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
The policy of the German Government shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather we are much more focused on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industrial Organization BDI, "the situation in Germany is now good.
However, in the next ten years, every developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Unemployment in Germany has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even the already slow-down consumption is on the increase again.
However, the declining GDP of the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% over the previous three months of June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weak performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "move from public consumption back to public investment", for example by concentrating future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
Kerber felt that the Merkel government would destroy the fruits of his Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in the early 2000s, with a strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienternehmen Foundation established for family businesses, "the situation in Germany is still good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies rather than government policies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social assistance and limiting the freedom to run a business is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more frankly, saying that the government's recent decisions are "a disaster".
Germany threatens to lose everything it has worked so hard for, only to please voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses in policy that have led to costs for industry that undermine competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher at the hand-to-hand music festival after security prevented access to the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach cantri music festival in Indio, California, where she is reported to have fallen into a fight with a tight security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a fight with a security guard at the country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backstage at the Stagecoach cantritic music festival in California, and then the situation got out of hand," says the TMS website.
Kutcher was in VIP space when a young woman approached him to greet and shake hands with him.
When the male half-series star went to greet a fan, an overzealous security guard intervened and caused a snout.
The actor and the security officer were caught in the hand, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to hold Kutcher off, TMZ says.
After resigning from his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is stars of the former 70s show.
The snooze occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from the hit series regular acting guard after he released a video in which he calls the series "fool" and urges fans not to watch it.

Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the show "fool" and urges people not to look.
Bacteria in the Baltic Sea killed a holidaymaker
Six people have been sick by bacteria from the Caribbean, settled in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulgarus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacterial spreads most effectively in brackish waters above 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere as long as conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS) told The Local magazine.
Bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He passed away in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg must be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenhoop with a small wound in his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after discovering on the way home that his leg has turned blue.
The doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulgarus on the leg.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known the danger," Sonja Bruehl, a sick woman, told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and damage to the patient and to the family could have been avoided if better information had been available, for example by a holiday destination.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors were invited to the next infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial illness.
"[Monday] test results revealed that V. vulgarus's strain has decreased significantly," Dr. Will says.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-producing bacteria, is particularly dangerous in individuals with pre-existing chronic liver disease and impaired immune response, such as in patients with HIV or diabetes mellitus and in the elderly.
The risk for men is higher than for women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If the bacteria get sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
After the bacteria enter the wound, the probability of death from the disease is about 25 percent.
V. vulnificus can also be contracted by eating seafood contaminated by it, although Dr. Will says that this is not the method of transmission in these cases.
Pollution of marine food is more common in the Southern Hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulgarus caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed due to a suspicion of cancer
Revealing 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen performs and exercises hard, but has also had to fear for his health.
After all, it's incredible that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He himself is amazed how there can suddenly be so many of those years of age.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
80 years does sound like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vieno Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
In late August, a birthday party was held for him by the People's Music and Pensioners' Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola's stage, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so overwhelmed by the party, the birthday girl tells me of an event where the stage, measured for three hundred, was full of congratulaters.
A couple of days later, Muhos gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following as a young man.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career there are few aspects of Vieno Kekkonen that have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never told in public before: 2006 one breast was removed from him.
There was an unclear finding in my chest at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
It was not cancer in the end, which, of course, I was happy about.
The same operation had a new breast, so it was a very big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he lost his own chest in a way in vain, for the knowledge of an unclear discovery would have been a heavy burden, and one cannot be neglected.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that for younger people the loss of their own chest is certainly more difficult.

The farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.
During the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle in particular have insisted on the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea.
In the same breath, rapid action has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer appears to be a superior nutrient expert compared to a few environmental scientists and journalists with their help.
The farmer knows that the nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the field has been sown with the same amount of nutrients as the crop harvests there.
Almost all farms in Finland are committed to an environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities will monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been washed into water after fertiliser restrictions, but there has been a marked reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers have the will and readiness to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
Everyone should realise, however, that it is impossible to reach a zero level.
"If we want to have about the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Aakula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought extensive blue algae deposits to the Gulf of Finland.
Scientists were quite agreed that algae gained its growth power from marine phosphorus storage.
The phosphorus stored in the bottom of the sea is partly a reverse from the agriculture of coastal states over the past decades, but that alone does not explain the stocks.
The treatment of wastewater in the growing cities of the Baltic shores was at a decay until the late 20th century.
The problem also affected the waste water of Great Helsinki and was not seen as a problem but as regards the pollution of its own beaches.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by the construction of a sewage pipeline to the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water directed to it has improved over the years.
Nutrients that once ended up in the sea will not leave there, even if agriculture is completely discontinued from Finland.
Yet every summer the blue algae debate and the accusations made always focus on agriculture today.
The public debate marks the farmer guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
Under the leadership of their chairman, Environment Minister Ville Niinistö, the Greens are pushing for major changes in agricultural environmental standards.
As a springboard, Niinistö has used summer algae discussion.
Mr Niinistö has, in all words, accused the producers' representative organisation MTK of being old-fashioned and considered it the most difficult obstacle to the protection of water.
There's supposed to be a line on political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in the field of water protection are specifically based on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental management.
Niinistö's offensive genre serves more fishing for urban green votes than water conservation.
I think that's the point.
With loud speeches, the Greens prepare to leave the government.
In policy changes, MTK is responsible for ensuring the livelihood of its members.
For farmers, expensive changes are difficult to trade unless a replacement is found for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is the cuts in other agricultural money.
The abolition of mining tax does not go through: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw a mine tax into the bin looks doomed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will abandon it without change.
The Australian Labour Party is also concerned that the government has included a rule in the new initiative which could limit employers' additions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government used a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to speed up the process of repeal in the face of general confusion and the clear indignation of the Labour Party.
It sidelined the original repeal initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes to, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described as mainly related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at overturning the "unsuccessful" mining tax as well as other decisions such as the low-income pension payment ($3.6 billion in savings), the earnings subsidy bonus ($1.3 billion) and the bonus ($4.7 billion for school-age children).
The leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP), Clive Palmer, did not approve the transfer of the government.
"A badly planned mining tax reversal initiative will not be accepted in the Senate without a pension fee for low incomes, a pay bonus for earned income and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The shadow finance minister Chris Bowen accused the government of attempting to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory guarantee amount for pension payments, giving the finance minister all the power to decide.
"This is unprecedented," he said to reporters in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay further additions, allowing the 12% target of the Labour Party's pension contributions to move up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, resist by all means," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop future increases.
The man's body was found on Brighton's beach.
Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the tide of two afternoons closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the coroner are working to determine the circumstances under which the body came to the beach.
He hasn't been identified yet.
Investigators review the list of missing persons to determine if missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to Mexican police, one fatality by accidental explosion at the border
According to Piedras Negras police, an apparently accidental explosion in a customs building on the Mexican-US border caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas serves as the operational director of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in the Sunday explosion suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in the accommodations of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion had no effect on border patrol.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
A male client plays at Showboat casino, scheduled to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29 July 2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means at the same time that this neon-light metropolis, known for the racket of money machines, can no longer count on gambling revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press news agency reported.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
The expected closure of three casinos, one of which had only been operational for two years, is the latest disaster in the city since the end of the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city's casino employees, 8,000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City suffering from a bad economy, the AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania break down much of Atlantic City's once huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, who opposed gambling in the past, looks at its own share of the money by welcoming three casinos into the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to the Industrial Power (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new estimate by the plant supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's third reactor will only be commercially available in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction is already largely completed and the number of unfinished works is known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen notes in the press release that TVO welcomes all initiatives that can speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva bulletin, the recent delays in the project have mainly been due to the approval of the reactor automation systems received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally due to be completed as early as 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in the arbitration court, where Areva has claimed compensation of up to EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva’s claims unfounded and requires approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm in the framework of the 24th International Water Week and called on energy and water operators to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure adequate water and energy production for an ever-increasing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
In the opening of the Water Week, Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the International Water Institute in Stockholm, which organised the Water Week, said that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water operators in order to find solutions that will enable all nations of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, the Water Prize winner of this year's Water Week, described water as a potential basis for growth needed both by society as a whole and by other sectors. Briscoe said that "developing countries face major challenges.
They must mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "[to the water crisis] there is no permanent solution anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI Gustava at a ceremony to be held at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday, September 4.
The International Institute of Water in Stockholm (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make sound decisions in terms of water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami crashed, and 14 people were reported to have died.
The same has happened to hundreds of people before, and this certainly was not the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1,000 Central American immigrants die illegally trying to cross the border of the United States.
For the first city, they're ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that when they arrive in the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either a refuge, an effort board up or a place of entertainment while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
A disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident live in cities popular with immigrants, where death and repatriation continue to work.
It is estimated that 20 percent of the bodies of those who died in southern Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of jargon from words to human remains) are flown to the homeland from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the CEO of the largest company in the industry, about 80% of this traffic travels abroad, flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and to several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home has a cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for flights to Latin America, and the table figures describe the human remains flown back to the country by the airline in 2013.
Returning bodies to their homeland is not cheap: prices may vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and public health requirements for the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in immigrant-popular cities sometimes organise funeral communities to help with the cost, because the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programs have once emerged from such communities founded by Italians, Jews, and Greeks living in New York City — the first migrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino, and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in several of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few foreign immigrants plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, the Sharia Act applies to foreigners who died without a will in Dubai, even if the laws on the collection of the deceased's homeland are different.
The entire assets of the deceased are frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia court.
A network of human remains of Aer Lingus, which is central to Dublin (
2013) The extent reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and Ireland.
The airline suspended the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a city favored by immigrants or while living there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant town is an open declaration about the immigrant's way of looking at life, not death.
However, death in an immigrant city abroad means making the strongest and most irreversible decisions for an immigrant — decisions as to whether you want to be part of a local or global community, a universe or a country, a short-term or eternal one.
The Centre and the Left Alliance put an intermediate issue of inequality
Opposition parties centre and left-wing union plan to put an intermediate issue to the government about the livelihood of low incomes and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate debate on people's income problems, which are aggravated by poor economic development and rising unemployment.
The growing inequality is also visible between the various parts of the country as well as within large cities, the parties point out in their bulletin.
In the government's budget next year, cuts and tax increases are targeted at low incomes, according to parties, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family members and regular employed persons, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continue to increase.
Almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The income problems of those in work have also worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Central and Left Alliance will deal with the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the Finns Party of Finland, has already announced that they are leaving the issue of the resources for police and internal security.
Parliament's autumn session starts tomorrow Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade will begin soon
The Caribbean culture once again reaches the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there politicians see each other and become seen.
The annual parade will be held Monday in Brooklyn.
It sighs at the celebrations of traditional carnivals prior to the fasting period, and part of it is dancers carrying complex, often feathered costumes.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn area, is this year's festival champion, but there are also many other faces known for politics to be expected.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the audience a week before the primary.
Despite the festivities, the parade weekend has also included violence in previous years.
Police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of extra measures, including monitoring the activities of gangs in the vicinity.
Do you even want to ask me rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
You don't want to answer that question.
This figure of speech, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but that hints at a particular answer, tastes both high-flying speeches and a more common-day-to-day exchange.
The opening words of Cicero's famous Catinina's accusation are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catinina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same goes for the questions my wife asked me, "Why shouldn't I warm up five days old chicken to the kids?"
Why are you so tense?
The severance theme is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidious rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree on it.
David Williams, author of the 19th-century material writing guide, described the rhetorical question as "some words addressed to some who are admirably designed to produce a strong sense of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they pose is impossible to disagree with."
The Art of Conjugation
You can ask rhetorical questions afterwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of rhetorical questions, designed to express grief or indignation, are called epiplexes.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you gain from oppressing me -- ?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see the way a person sees?
Chains of rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is the so-called hypophora, what is involved when asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex stag for all women?
Beard!
That's right!
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food the children have eaten and where could they have become sick?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, the rhetorical question usually does not try to persuade, although rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you try to talk someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted or become enraged by someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept one’s own opinion.
If the audience agrees with the argument "It's not nice when it's so sunny outside?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim, which binds the speaker and the audience better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no dissenting opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been achieved rather than seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to a weak point of argument.
In the headlines of the magazines, the rhetorical question is all too often clearly the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the insinuated answer.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" included the risky campaign phrase of the British Conservative Party in the general election in 2005.
The party lost.
For some, finding such cases has become a hobby, and so-called QTWAIN issues (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, made known by British journalist John Rentoul, are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition to look for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", sung by pop star Gary Glitter before he was revealed to be a child's sexual abuser.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Investigator: The time for a federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that a federal state could be some sort of compromise to the conflict, says Saari.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that to gain peace in East Ukraine requires talks about the state station in the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government to Eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of those living in the east.
Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is, according to Saare, a certain priority of Russia's ambitions.
Ukraine certainly has every reason to suspect that Russia would use it to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If no federal solution is reached, another option could be some kind of frozen conflict from Russia's point of view, where Russia would effectively control Luhanski and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers east.
Russia has denied the allegations, although, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have fought "for-soon, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Up leader: An influential mission planned for Katainen
The brickman reminds me that the job description is new and is still emerging.
The idea, he said, is that Katainen would in some way coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
One of the Commission's priorities for the new period programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says Tiilikainen.
Mr Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, economic competence and role during the economic crisis give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be uncased, i.e. Katainen would not have his own Directorate-General under his authority.
Instead, Katais would become a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment sector, allowing him to have, in addition to the portfolio of the Economic Commissioner, other portfolios related to the sector to be coordinated.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Association, as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and over 7,000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the Rostov City Hospital near the Ukrainian border is crowded with wounded in the Ukrainian War.
The soldiers' mothers collect their information from the soldiers' families.
The military alliance NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte on his alcohol use: "After a little drink comes a story"
big brother Jussi and Andte drifted on Monday night to reflect on the life of the BB house.
Jussi, on the basement side, pedaled a fitness bike on Monday night with Andte, a member of the Manor's residents, chatting.
The two wondered what their actions looked like to the viewers of the show.
I don't know until I see it, Andte said.
According to Jussi, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or missions make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
It's more like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of the mansion spent the evening in wet conditions and alcohol especially got Andte's talkative turn.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made a man's life in the house more meaningful now that he had reached a small hippo to discuss them with other residents.
A little drink, and then there's a story, Andte admits.

Anna Abreu reveals her body crush on Me in Women
Anna Abreu says in Me Women that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she stayed on a show break.
At the time, Anna, tired of playing gigs, thought that losing weight would give her more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago, Anna dreamed of a body like Victoria's Secret.
My body crush was Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight," Anna tells the magazine.
Anna, who performs her trained body with gigs and music videos, says that she is not a lust trainer, even though she is named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, in Timmish condition, trains at the gym and engages in boxing.
Visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can lift a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to feast.
If I eat, I really do.
Sometimes I take an unhealthy overdose, and I don't wonder if there's any more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'm sick of doing something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Corporate profit distribution is pleasing to shareholders but does not increase growth
Do Australian stock exchange leaders today simply seek to please a large crowd by admitting to shareholders' wishes for a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to shareholders that the government serves?
The distribution of profits is the most important one, found out last week at the end of the 2014 reporting period.
The prices of shares in companies that have won investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have clearly increased.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is decreasing faster than the analysts have predicted, a fact that causes many to wonder whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether there is sufficient focus on future and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is obtained from, for example, low-cost stock markets.
From the company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds raised on the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that the generousness of the shareholders is financed, above all, by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of capital decline" during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and fewer capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of repurchase programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of expected, unrealised capital procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to regard capital consumption as a curse word in one of the headlines of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, unofficial evidence has been in existence for months.
Glenn Stevens, director of the Australian Central Bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "fight spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow capital consumption generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "the reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% over the previous two years.
Estimates of free cash flows have increased by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I had a coin every time the CEO said that the short-term price of the stock is not important, I would have... Well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
CEOs are very closely following stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short- and long-term bonus packages of suppliers are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of managers depends on it.
CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether in the form of acquisitions, increased investment in the organisation or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to the investment market.
Therefore, the current gust of conservativeism seems to be in line with short-term objectives.
However, it was all too clear during the reporting period just ended that the emphasis was on reducing future capital consumption, and the most sparing companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the top priority in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also acted the same – some under compulsion and some because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, are investors putting pressure on companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse's strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as profits from other, more traditional fixed-profit investment products have been reduced as suddenly central banks have reduced interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
Thus, investors have been forced into the capital market to seek profits and, in turn, pressure companies to share more profit.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would prefer the money immediately as more and more investors approached the retirement age.
Statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution was heavily influenced by operating expenses cuts rather than growth in turnover.
Cases of leaking celebrity nude photos appear to be data-checking or breaking into an e-mail account
According to Jennifer Lawrence's pictures and some sources, an unknown hacker leaking videos into the Internet wonders information security experts and Apple.
Although a hacker has published lists of female public figures in a chatroom and said that she has more pictures of women, some of the photos have reported that their images are fake while others have said that they were pictures removed long ago.
There are a lot of filmed and the group has been said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton, and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what was done through the attack.
And were the pictures and videos authentic and from where were they loaded?
The most featured source in the news for images – an unscrupulous and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house to try to penetrate the company's own systems regularly.
"A large-scale hack into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
The original publisher also does not claim that the claim is correct," notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Data Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for hacks related to these public figures (as well as for hacks involving less famous people every day) is the leakage of e-mail address and password, either by guessing or by fishing for information, i.e. by tricking a person to log in with their information on a genuine-looking site, and then this information is used against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhone phones to save settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to a cloud server.
The user's account can be logged into the iCloud service by providing this email address and password, and then their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-stage authentication ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against entering an account, thus sending a code to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few use the 2FA feature, either because it is unknown, or because it is considered laborious.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information originates from its iCloud service, and if so, how extensively the user accounts were infiltrated.
The company has not issued an opinion at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Did you forget the password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting email addresses of public figures, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's pictures claims that the images are authentic, but does not say when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These images were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took for a gruesome effort.
I have sympathy for everyone else who was being hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed the photos from his mobile phone, but removing the picture from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in a cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of photos taken by the user.
The standard setting for Apple's iPhone is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic image and data storage services.
"People take and remove pictures, but do not understand that images are being downloaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Removed does not always mean removed," he states.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone has access to the user's email address and password, they can reload all images and videos that have been sent by email.
From Apple's service, images can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
Hacker released a screen image allegedly portraying videos and images taken from Windows PC, so far unreleased.
Two-stage authentication protects against this kind of hacking, as it requires anyone trying to copy an existing account to another device to give the original user's device, usually a code sent to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account is blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo provide a two-stage authentication account, but it is not yet known whether these public figures used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures in which they are claimed to be are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures where Grande is claimed to be are "fully fake".
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "The nude photos that are supposed to be taken from me are FALSE, don't you understand.
Let me cut off the rumors right from the start.
Cluley brings up another option.
Since the hacking was targeted by public figures, someone may have broken into their accounts who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their emails.
"I would like to know whether the actors' agents or some representative have any part to play," he ponders.
However, those public figures do not use a single publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped configure one or more systems of the victim's security attack and secretly changed the system so that all information can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney of Florida, who received the "Hollywood hacker" nickname, where the hacker distributed photos from email accounts of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly invading email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera in the name of this stylist for pictures of a star in little clothes, and then released the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions "were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy you could imagine."
Chaney was also claimed to have spying on two people online for over ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, the star email accounts were broken into, and changed so that someone sent their data forward also after changing the password".
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "reminiscent of collecting butterflies".
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that, in this case, someone had come across a list of services such as Dropbox containing information on these accounts and log-in information.
The hackers may also have tried to invade for a long time.
or they had access to data from an email account, such as an address book, and then fished for data from other people.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped in Syria by terrorists associated with al-Qaeda.
Terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to hold 44 Fijian peacekeepers imprisoned, a terrorist group that conquered the crossing point in the Golan hills last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
The Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday and there is no record of their whereabouts.
At Samoa, ministers attending the conference of the small developing island states of the United Nations, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australia's help to rescue the missing Peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN wherever it can, by providing, among other things, intelligence service assistance," he said to the AAP News Service from Samoa on Monday.
We keep in very close contact with all the partners and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, a Filipino peacekeeping group held captive in its army barracks was reported to have escaped in a different part of the same controversial area.
The UN has been overseeing the Golan hills since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
The scammers are trying to steal your money through a carbon tax reversal initiative, warn the Australian competition authority ACCC
The scammers are using the carbon tax reversal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses against relying on allegedly sounding bids from government agencies offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Fraudsters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save in the purchase of goods after the carbon tax has been abolished and offering him up to $7,000, the warning says.
Fraudsters may sound very convincing because they have discovered the victim’s personal information that they use in trying to get their hands on bank information or in trying to get the victim to pay a fee.
They're discussing topical issues to trick the victim.
The scammers use more than a carbon tax scam to get access to money, their stories are more sophisticated and they take advantage of current things to build a scam around them.
Also, the plane lost on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have inspired fraudsters.
The ACCC instructs you to contact the company through self-disclosed contact details rather than contact details provided by the caller if there is the slightest doubt about the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation due to the abolition of the carbon tax, be on your guard.
If you believe that you have been cheated and provided personal information or transferred money to the imposter's account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, free money distributed by the government – it is likely that it is.
Financial messages: Lipponen reproaches EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises EU sanctions against Russia in an interview with Economics.
Russia's political priority is to promote its own interests.
The sanctions may not work," Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a business liquidator for the Arctic Regions of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK).
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) EIB suspended their project funding in Russia as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that Northern Dimension environmental projects with clear prospects go into ice," Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampering cooperation, which Lipponen says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue to be as great as before.
He is currently conducting an EK study on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks a long way forward, talking about tens of years," he says.
Rarely that the norppa comes into shallow water or near the settlement, says nature pedagogist Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Museum of Ostrobothnia.
On Sunday, in Suvilahti, Vaasa, a noose was seen swimming near the beach.
According to Heinonen, the Norppa is likely to have come to Suvilahti after food.
It's not a mess.
This means there is fish in the area, Heinonen hints.
According to him, for example, on the Sundom Bridge there are sightings, especially in the springs and autumns, of Norps, which arrive specifically after fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Area.
On the land of the liver you see Norms on the fronts of the villas, he continues.
The Norp lives in the Bothnian and Archipelago Seas, among others.
According to the South Australian court, murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga.
The court hearing has revealed that the pizzeria owner, Robert Vallelonga, behaved aggressively against both his partner and the security guard only minutes before being killed outside the nightclub.
Lawyers charged with killing Vallelonga asked Adelaide in the lower court for the release of their client against bail because it was "clearly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case is not serious enough to hold her client whose identity has not been released, behind bars until the trial.
"According to the evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, a snout began, resulting in the 40-year-old drunk man -- tore the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecution, death was caused by one stroke, clearly suggesting self-defense or defence of another.
For the time being, a 25-year-old man is only being accused of killing.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at approximately 2:25 a.m. on May 4th, with severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries at Adelaide Royal Hospital early the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers remained to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
According to prosecutors, there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver "that he had put someone to sleep for a few days".
However, the video footage from the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client's side has both the assumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security officers present on the night of the crash had interfered with the conduct of Vallelonga.
According to them, other security guards didn't think he was threatening because "he was short," and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that the taxi driver who clearly saw the incident would also prove that Vallelonga was hit with "powerful" and did not have a chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week when he would declare his decision.
Controversial Dolphinija began in Japan - Justified as a tradition - Foreign News - Evening Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to postpone the start of a world-widely disenchanted hunt.
In the Japanese town of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A wealth of opposition to a yacht from around the world is reported, among others, by the British newspaper Guardian.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bayside where mammals are slaughtered after the selection of the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends up as food.
According to local authorities, however, the start of hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
Knowledge of the practice spread to the world with a 2009 documentary entitled The Cove.
During previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticized not only by animal guardians but also by diplomats.
According to opponents, in any case, dolphin meat has limited markets due to its high mercury content.
According to the defenders of hunting, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
The defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin trapper was already opposed during the weekend in several countries with demonstrations.
According to protesters in Tokyo, the hunt harms Japan's reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO Member States are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the views are divided as to whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries in response to the Ukrainian crisis, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics, and it threatens to overthrow European security," told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London.
NATO member countries will be gathered in the beginning of the week, and the military alliance is due to announce its new contingency plan.
The central question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the Convention on Conventional Weapons signed in 1990.
In it NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on how they will deploy armed forces in the Atlantic-Ural Mountain region.
In practice, the agreement blocks new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself froze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be respected.
"Nato's resources must be in all the NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind to the Financial Times, Chairman of the Security Committee of the British Parliament.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest to fly around the world
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest flying around the world – and even alone, reported CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A youth living in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On his journey, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star due to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun".
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the authors of such comments.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also involved a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I will also inspire other people to go out to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's airlift started early, first he asked his parents to eat at the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on taking flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20-paying, 20-minute tour, but I think they thought at the time my enthusiasm would stop there.
He didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon thereafter made a deal with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of getting my own car.
In trade, I could fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight license and two years later he leased a single-engined Beechcraft aircraft for his single flight around the world.
A young man who studied at MIT college managed the maintenance of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours on the upper surface also meant that he himself needed additional refueling —
In practice, a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookie sticks completely during a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and frightening.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no weather radar to help him navigate the storms.
I had no idea which of the clouds only reached a little above the plane and which of them reached a height of 45,000 feet and would tear the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel in the plane would not have reached a higher level.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman died after his plane dropped on the American flight between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his journey the most difficult part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the rise stage is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel required for a 16-hour flight.
Despite the risks and even the fear of a high place, however, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for IT training through Code.org.
He is himself a coder, and founded his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but now let's see how it goes.
In any case, Guthmiller intends to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can accomplish something great.
Finding the right franchiser is harder than you think
Lori Joyce was thrilled by fans waiting in line for her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores all over Canada after Canada's W television channel began to show The Cupcake Girls a true TV show in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the task.
"My Frenchise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers line up outside the store ready to buy a cup cake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes, for it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the selection process for franchise partners, starting with emphasis on the company's culture-like leadership skills instead of baking skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has had about 100 interviews with each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but the employees work in a completely different way in the working environment themselves, so the whole process is quite difficult. This is why education in Finland emphasizes above all the suitability for a business culture.
Finding the right franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small business.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow the organization, while a poorly suited manager can cause costly damage to the company.
"Before I thought that looking for a franchise entrepreneur is like going on a date, but it's not at all true, there's a lot you can do to get to know someone before getting married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a permanent contract is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is built.
To engage in partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and a major confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship between Franchise parties resembles a strong marriage, as they share common goals, explains the chairman and CEO of Lorraine McLachla, Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the franchise entrepreneur should also be careful in selecting the future franchisee provider before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as relationships: if your date is rude on a date already, imagine what she's like in a marriage?", she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future partner and to pay attention to the smallest alarm signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise providers such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time those who give franchises must be more careful when choosing their first, most important partners.
On the other hand, new franchise providers need to conclude, on the basis of a supposedly successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills a new franchise entrepreneur needs to face in the face of similar difficulties.
For the first time, franchise companies may also request the assistance of a franchise advisor to create a profile based on the industry's practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time, there is a lot of help available on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later because franchisers will learn to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs can give advice and help in the assessment.
"The work input of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in creating a company and franchise system," says Erik Church, O2E Brands's operational director. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs must choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a Toronto franchise partner for You Move Me.
Chrich's method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"One of the confidence tests we use is to ask ourselves 'Would I invite this person to a weekend barbecue?'," he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'no', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking for solutions to major business challenges with them."
Church further notes that O2E Brands is largely to thank its franchise structure for its success.
In a business organization, managers often see their own position as short-term and the lower level of management of the relationship as very formal, while franchise entrepreneurs enter into a partnership with long-term goals and thus are more committed to the company's success.
"Franchise partnership has many more advantages over traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if managed well, it will produce better results.
Rail delays lower grain prices in the north of the United States
Delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the northern central parts of the United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put under new pressure from the transport network.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 from the bushel - about a dollar less than the control prices - mainly because of the cost of securing the rail capacity of the incoming train, traders and farming organizations say.
IN Raw materials
The problems are most acute on the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway company and Canadian Pacific railway company.
Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to resort to railways for the transport of agricultural products, because they are far from river networks.
Delays in train transport increased as the high harvest of 2013 was followed by a very cold winter that caused slow-down and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transportation of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has displaced grain transport, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a director of an international grain trading company, the cost of securing the use of the train by grain storage and transfer vendors has risen from zero to as much as $2,000 to $3,000 per wagon per year.
Someone's got to pay for it.
"These costs will be paid by either the farmer or the customer," says the manager of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Agriculture Agency estimates that the soy bean harvest in North Dakota will increase by over a third and the spring crop by 16%.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we are trying to start a new crop from a clean table, meaning that sufficient storage space has been emptied for the crop and the grain has been sold and moved.
Now, however, we start late due to the service problems of trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President responsible for the transport of BNSF's agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the sum of prolonged transport (customer-ordered train wagons, which took more than four days to deliver) from the peak of early April, 16 500, to about two thousand.
"We've moved almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the grain that was left over from the previous crop.
However, the latest reported speeds for BNSF grain trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "uneven" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all types of transportable products, such as grain peaks.
The trains of the Canadian Pacific railway company, which suffered from problems due to the second suma, are 11 per cent lower than at the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much low speeds of the first year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has told the Railway Supervisor (Surface Transportation Board) that the changes made to its rail wagon order system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% in the coming harvest season.
"The action plan for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company in autumn focuses on continuous improvement of train speed and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more railway wagons every week," said a representative of the railway company.
The Ukrainian crisis may resolve NATO's "identity crisis"
Leaders, diplomats and experts from large countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether NATO's mission to Afghanistan will end, including NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident from the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, with 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
The task list of politicians and diplomats has no shortage of world crises, even to the extent that the departure of Afghan troops, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, a union of 28 states is needed after Russia has re-entered Ukraine, a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence spending and re-engage in defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) looked for its purpose in some way -- and it was going through a fairly significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, director of the European programme for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
NATO has not only found a new purpose but has also strengthened itself.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for the rapid defeat of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in an attempt to inspire his war-tired collaborators to a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he leads the world to find a strategy to defeat extremist Islamists after first stating directly that "we do not have a strategy."
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether Ukraine or the Islamic State will achieve breakthroughs.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main punishment for an event called the Russian invasion by Ukraine.
European Union officials dealt with this issue this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
US officials pointed out that the states Obama hopes for main partners in the Islamist problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be anticipated two years ago when the last NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates, then leader, used his last speech in his position to say that the organization has almost reached the point of "common military insignia".
Officials in the United States continued to complain that other countries did not achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence spending, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, White House officials say they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there is a genuine desire in the company, as Member States see possible threats to their actual size.
After Russia invades Ukraine, the union's "defence pledges are more significant and more important than once after the end of the Cold War," says Charles Kupchan, President of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach consensus among 28 Member States.
Obama spends much of his trip to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation in favour of Russia's troubled neighbouring countries.
The President begins his three-day trip with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets both Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian leaders.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine to itself this year, and NATO forces will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new contingency plan, to be published this week, is introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in border states, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible signs of defence cooperation.
The changes present a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
Officials say that the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it may also be a semantic distinction, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to be public in the context of the debates before being officially informed.
NATO's presence will probably be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin has a powerful "winter" - does he use it for Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace up his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in East Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
That is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has intensified, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, holds a trump card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American authority, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and coal (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, an influence at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, Ukrainians will freeze in their homes as gas supply from Russia stops.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war at the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's accrued debt on gas was already $5.3 billion (about EUR 4 billion) by August 1.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one will think about it (winter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to solve it.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to rebuild stocks, necessary repairs must be made and the cold season prepared.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company, from Nomura, remarked last month that Russia's talks on humanitarian intervention and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activity until then.
Moscow has already been notified that Ukraine will have to pay for the gas supplies in advance if Kiev does not start to pay the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue on a temporary basis.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenyuk said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, told us that the speeches were false.
He said that Russia will do everything in its power to supply gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger was given 10 years in prison and a thousand lashes
The Saudi tribunal has upheld the ten-year prison sentence imposed on Raif Badaw, who founded the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The sentence includes an additional penalty of one thousand lashes and a one million (about EUR 200 000) fine.
The judgment was based on the fact that he had set up a website demeaning Islam.
On Monday, Suad al-Shamari, the co-founder of the organization, told the AFP of the verdict.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced in July 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but the sentence was appealed and re-submitted.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures' Riku Rantala childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one revolutionary human encounter"
Madventures today released a new book entitled World Explanation - The Adventurer's Explanation of Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells of the most significant human encounter in his life.
Writer, journalist, co-party of Madventures Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie picnic at Civic Market and Wednesday begins the second season of Docventures on Yle.
Since morning, he's been running from place to place.
From Maikkari's morning TV to take the child to kindergarten and then to a weekly meeting.
A face-to-face interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
That's the only way we're gonna make it.
In the midst of all the rush he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which, according to the book's cover, is an adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything?
Wow, that's a lot of promise.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture does worse than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book's experts include both professors and artists.
We worked actively on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've taken a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the key message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is to be good travel reading, but its purpose is also at home to get people to discuss and share ideas.
The discussion can even lead to action," Riku says.

One of the themes in your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, we must believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a sort of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can there be a change, Riku philosopher.
Riku reports that according to some studies Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This suggests that once there is enough money and our basic need has been satisfied, we are happy.
Money does not add to happiness.
We want to raise people to discuss what is enough.
The utilisation of our natural resources will not last much longer, Riku says.
In your book, you also consider cultural differences.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't differ much.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India in both good and bad.
Once the Western countries have prospered, people live more alone.
Isolate ourselves from others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found the right balance between community and being alone, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
Riku has met a lot of different people around the world.
What human encounter is best in his mind?
It takes place in my childhood, when I was with my family on the first larger trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was working for the UN.
I was seven years old and two of my younger siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku is laying the groundwork.
A large moving car took a ride home to Finland.
We drove a war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the sides of the road.
A girl my age walked down the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big Mercedes bench with a Coke Lock in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A kid of your age will understand the situation.
It was one revolutionary human encounter that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Riku "went to cabbage" that other people must be respected, even if they are significantly poorer or do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
Riku already realized at the time that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adult life to the surface, people in New Guinea come to face.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, little money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me wonder.
And he and Tunna want to get his new book readers, too.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, watch and listen to more.
That it would make people act from warm-hearted lovemaking to conversation or even a fistfight, Riku throws.
The Kauhajoki magazine tells about this.
The events started when the couple arrived by bus at the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi moved, the man in the yard threw an object after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, so did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed a male passenger in the head and hand life-threateningly and left the scene.
The knife is a 170-175 centimetre pole, short-haired man.
According to the paper, there has been a young, blond ponytailed woman in the vicinity of the scene.
They're hoping he'll contact the police.
The police also ask for clues from all those who may have made observations about events or the persons involved.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday 27 August at 7:50 p.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the Internet
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article saying that the international team of researchers has been the first to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages to be sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", meaning "hi" in Spanish and Italian.
In the test arrangement, the electrical brain curve of the test subject was monitored.
The sender was trained by the program to send bits by thinking about either hand or foot movement.
Illustration of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and moving hands as one.
This bit-coded information was sent through the net to the recipient person.
The receiver was induced by magnetic stimulation to detect a flash of light for every bit encoded to be number one.
The receiver had been taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still an area of research in their children’s shoes, but believe that computer-assisted telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Sanctions - Punkti - Rural future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action follows reaction, act countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be effective in the long term.
Iran was not persuaded to negotiate its nuclear programme until after years.
The South African racial oppression government sat still for decades, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
There have also been sanctions against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export state-of-the-art electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time the woodwork was used was to freeze the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians have become accustomed to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban imports of vodka from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians would love to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to stop imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
Financial sector restrictions are the main drawbacks.
They won't be effective until the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but taking a new one is difficult.
Even though Russia has huge foreign reserves, they will not last forever.
The credit supply of Russian companies is declining and the money is rising.
My own banks are not able to finance everyone.
Money has to be printed more or companies have payment difficulties.
Bankruptcy is also a bankruptcy in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis goes on for years, the Russian modernisation will stop, as René Nyberg, a Russian expert, wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would return to Russia once again and curl inwards.
An exceptional free wrestling event took place in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, along with a number of diplomats, followed international free wrestling matches held in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki, a lawyer who became a free wrestler, took part in an event from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil, and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, taekwondo matches of local athletes were also seen.
According to Inoki, the aim of the event was through sport to bring contentious states closer together and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for a better relationship between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
The most recently seen in North Korea was international free wrestling in 1995.
The SOK reduces the organisation of the commodity trade by approximately 110 people.
The Yt negotiations began in June, when the need for reduction was estimated at a maximum of 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been dismantled and its responsibilities have been clarified.
The SOK states that it will clearly seek better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the fall in consumer demand, the background lies in the restructuring of trade, which has shaken the trade in goods, in particular.
The result of the S-Group's commodity trade has been at a loss for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of the SOK's operating and grocery trade, i.e. approximately 530 people.
Turun Sanomat: Some of the self-care drugs behind the counter
According to the paper, there are more medicines coming between prescription medicines and medicines being taken from the shelf itself that would be available without the prescription, but only after advice from a pharmacy worker.
According to the Finnish Association of Pharmacies, eye drops containing antibiotics could be included in advice.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and when the predefined criteria are met, the medicine should be administered behind the counter, ponders Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Association of Pharmacies, in Turun Sanomam.
Finland already needs a few medicines without a prescription, but requires advice.
One such is the emergency contraceptive.
Corruption for More Reasons
Finland pays more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the lack of bribery cases and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Justice Department's task force will consider whether sections of the Criminal Code would be needed to trade and abuse influence.
Differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the trial of Patria's bribery case in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, trading influence brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister, but Finnish law does not know the corresponding criminal title.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, bribery is hardly investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University of Applied Sciences on the vulnerability of corruption in various fields.
Messi suffers groin injury - Sports - Karelian
Captain Lionel Messi of the Argentine football team will miss Wednesday's national match against Germany.
Messi keeps the stand side groin injury, told his club Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona considers Messi's side a precaution.
Messi insulted the groin in a Sunday league match against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he will get replacements for the Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many of the players on the Western Sydney Wanderers team are banned in the first game, and Coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witch pot FC Seoul match.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp that also includes two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match to be held on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss the trip to Korea, but Coach Popovic believes in their replacements.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned in China for this gesture.
After all, it is a setback, none of the players should be gone, but we did not have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes to the ranch must have worked a lot, and I have complete confidence in the entire team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone in the semifinals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovic, who continues to recover from ankle surgery.
The defender of The Socceroos team was injured before the start of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play in a return match at the Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back in the career and is recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually going back to the field.
He's already practiced a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll be a while before she's completely fine, but she'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has facilities representing the world's top in the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also felt that the trip to Dubai was a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after major changes at the end of last season.
"We know that this will certainly help players create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both in the field and outside.
So we take advantage of the camp for many purposes.
The elite hamburger pays three times the worker's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the elite of the country.
The economics torn apart by contrast are reported by the Financial Times.
In North Korea, informal markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer wealthy or thrifty ordinary citizens luxury that is not used to uniting with a dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the amusement center, to which a mere ticket costs up to ten months' average worker's salary.
There's burgers here that cost $76.
That's three to five months' pay to a regular employee in the country.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and nice.
North Korea's "Western market" originated in the 1990s, when the country suffered famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies may be gross at worst.
Still, in Pyongyang, the capital, many have a cell phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the reason may be in the ruler Kim Jong sleep, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the country's flourishing.

Ormiston House: Council of Stormont hopeful about sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers almost £3,000 a week.
The Council purchased a 19th-century building in the eastern parts of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, when the security and maintenance of the building cost the Council about £400 a day.
The building was sold recently for £1.25 million.
The building will apparently be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a B-class building of historical value for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was re-issued for sale at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party suggested that Ormiston House might fit into the facilities of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is conducting negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the council and the real estate agent remain silent about the buyer's identity and sale price.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormiston House are about £3,000.
The Council purchased the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
The security costs of Ormiston House by the beginning of this year totaled £885,641 and maintenance costs £371,379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was £250,015 and the fees for development and design professionals were £212,466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.
"Differentness Grows": Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There will be no savings, claims JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction in the number of school-based school assistants is being prepared.
The deduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to present a total of around 2.7 million trials on the resources of school assistants.
There are about 600 schooling assistants in Helsinki.
If contractions occur, they will take effect during the middle of the semester immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce assistants for reasons of savings because the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There will certainly be no savings; on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff will increase.
Savings for schoolchildren will increase the risk of falling from learning goals and the ability of teachers to cope is tough," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Director of Industry at JHL.
The plans of the City of Helsinki discriminate between schools, because with future resources, small schools and students who need support will no longer receive assistant resources at all.
The objective of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, the Office's adjustment measures are mostly targeted at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final decision on resources will be made in the autumn by the City Council of Helsinki, for whom I hope to have a vision and wisdom of looking to the future and acting in accordance with its goals," says Niemi-Laine.
Israel occupies the land on the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the Etzion settlement near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over nearly 400 hectares of land in the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel's future significant construction in the region, and at the same time defies the Palestinians' request not to build more settlements and defy the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposes the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, felt that Sunday events could be the largest single invasion of the country in the West Bank region for decades and could " dramatically change the situation in the region".
The Palestinians' goal is to establish their own state in the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political stimulus to assess the situation in the land areas came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they hitchhiked in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the invasion of the land suggests that it was intended as a kind of compensation for the population of settlement and punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish Gevaot settlement, the land in the South Jerusalem Etzion settlement has now been officially declared "land of the state" when it used to be privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step for Israel to begin planning buildings in the area if it wanted to.
However, Ahmad Lafi, Mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff published orders early on Sunday in which Israel announced that it would take over land containing olive and other tree plantations in Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people prompted the Israeli army to carry out a disciplinary return in the West Bank against the Islamist group that dominates Gaza, Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The ensuing tensions on the Israeli- Gaza Strip flared up in a 50-day war that ended last week with a ceasefire by Egypt.
The invasion of the land has quickly drawn attention to the West Bank under Israeli control and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government, which make it difficult for the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process to take place.
Crisis municipalities in Lapland are usually multi-problems
An increasing proportion of the municipalities in Lapland are in problems, is evident from the welfare study prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The joint features of crisis municipalities include poor local government finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Emeritus of sociology at the University of Lapland, Asko Suikkanen, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and East Lapland.
In the survey section, residents assessed the situation in their municipality quite realistically.
In the survey, residents of well-performing municipalities even viewed the outlook pessimistically.
Low expectations have an impact on consumption.
People wish that today’s everyday life and well - being would be preserved, perhaps even a little improved.
In this time you do not dare think about longer term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The research group was surprised by the large differences between municipalities.
For example, the cost of income support per capita varies from two to tens to well over 100 euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita varies from just over EUR 2 thousand in Ranua to EUR 4400 in Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How the money is used, how much government shares are obtained, and what is the degree of debt, differs much in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders on returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent Islamist fighters who have left for Iraq and Syria from returning to their homeland.
The BBC reports on the matter, referring to government sources.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals being considered.
The proposal is being finalised and is to be presented by Prime Minister David Cameron.
The government is also looking for ways to make it more difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities to allow them to temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr rejoices over the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from Libyan prison today.
The federal government rejoiced at the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
A representative of Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "everything is going well" and the attorney of the International Criminal Court will be released to the Australian authorities this evening, and then boarding a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased with the news that he is likely to be released today," the spokesman commented on the matter to the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its help and support," the representative said.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of his criminal court colleagues were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintani on 7 June as they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of Muammar Gaddafi, a former dictator of Libya.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took documents to Seif that they felt threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone to great lengths to free Taylor, including traveling to Tripoli, Libya's capital, last month to pursue his cause.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or her little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with John and Janelle, parents who lived in Taylor's Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other arrested criminal court attorneys are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr reported a week ago that as a result of a debate between the lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has promised to investigate the actions of its team thoroughly after its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court has closed its investigation, it will ensure that everyone who has done wrong will be judged in a fair manner," the Court announced in a press release last month.
The International Criminal Court is demanding a trial for 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May in which it announced that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
A young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easy didn't fall at Villarreal's home.
The blue-reds pushed their heads to the Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjo until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winning goal was scored by a surprising man: 19-year-old, from his first appearance in La Liga, the attacker Sandro Ramirez had only come to the field 12 minutes earlier.
The young man who received the invitation from Barcelona's second team to represent him finished close after Asenjo had turned down Lionel Messi's company.
Collections to Ferguson police mysteriously ended after a $433,000 crossing
The administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites collected over $400,000 to the police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, the state of Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity website, open to the general public, two separate pages carrying similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have raised $235,750 and $197,620 for a Fergusonian police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site operated by a Brown family lawyer had raised $314,099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and demonstration against the nearly white police force of Ferguson, mostly populated by blacks, who forced Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations attempt to determine whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have given rise to some controversy over Wilson's defence, especially since some visitors to the page had written racist comments in the comment section, which have since been deleted.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations at about the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators gave no reason for this.
As a guest tries to make a donation on the page, he sees a message saying "No more donations taken!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website gave a bulletin to Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every organizer of the GoFundMe campaign decides for himself when he wants to stop receiving donations," said Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website, in her press release.
Organizers may also continue to receive donations at a later date if they so wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a yield of $197,620, is maintained by a charity group of St. Louis cops Shield of Hope, a recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers named on the Shield of Hope state collection register as official representatives Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda did not respond immediately on Sunday to emails requesting further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official spokesperson for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missouri House of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has raised $235,750. He has not been confirmed as a recipient of donations approved by the site.
However, a spokesman for the GoFundMe site, in a press release to The Times, assured that an anonymous philanthropist exists.
The anonymous benefactor of the collection campaign has been given little information to donors, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson page philanthropist wrote a message two weeks ago to visitors of the site that the site collaborates with the Shield of Hope group to become an officially accepted recipient of donations.
No approval has yet been granted.
The benefactor gave visitors who wanted more information an aliased Gmail address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to a request for more information.
A spokesman for the GoFundMe page said in a press release to The Times that an anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results of the main website and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements announced by the GoFundMe website to have a functional Facebook account available".
In GoFundMe website's information security policies, users are urged to "give only to GoFundMe users whom they know personally and which they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no firm guarantee that the content of the collection page published on GoFundMe is accurate and honest.
According to Representative Little, however, GoFundMe "has been in contact with the campaign organizer, and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds raised if there is a need to initiate investigations in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds raised by the campaign in question.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns to support Wilson, told the site's followers this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "explanatory", why donors from the GoFundMe site have been prevented from donating, but the page gave no further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on Facebook page, and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal's top attacker at the end of the year - Valio League - Evening Sanomat
The French attacker Olivier Giroud of the English Premier League Arsenal is likely to be on the side until the turn of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and it takes months to recover.
Giroud injured his leg this weekend in a Premier League match against Everton.
The surgery went well, but he is on the sidelines until he is able to play at the top level, until the end of December or the beginning of January, Arsenal's head coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's best scorer last season with 16 hits, so the loss is substantial.
However, according to Wenger, he does not necessarily acquire a patcher for Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger played fresh acquisition at the top of Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday in the Champions League qualifying final against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez's goal.
There's a lot of Hollywood celebrities' naked photos going around the Internet, and there's a lot of suspicion of hacking.
The pictures claimed to be nude by several public figures were toured on Sunday in social media.
The photos included Oscar-winning actor Jennifer Lawrence and pop star Rihanna.
According to U.S. media, the images are suspected of being the subject of extensive hacking.
According to the media, the images would have been stolen from Apple's iCloud cloud service accounts.
"It's really weird and hard when privacy is taken away," Lawrence tweeted.
According to the media, the photos also included actress and model Jenny McCarthy, reality TV performer Kim Kardashian, and singer and actress Avril Lavigne.
According to an actor and pop star Ariana Grande spokesperson, the pictures where a woman is claimed to be are fakes.
That's what singer Victoria Justice said.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played in horror movies, said that the intimate pictures of her are years old.
KeskiFinnish: Finns rely on the security of online banks
Most Finns rely on the security of online banks, reports the Central Finns.
According to a survey conducted by the magazine, four out of five consider network bank security to be good.
The age of the respondents is clearly visible in the answers.
Young people believe the most in the security of online banks, the least in pensioners.
Tuula Sario, the leading lawyer in the Consumer Union, is not surprised by the views.
Those who use a lot of the Internet usually rely most on its services.
Those who do not use the services, however, are ignorant and suspicious, he ponders in Central Finland.
Most Finns are customers of an online bank.
The most common business is on the computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming increasingly common.
A thousand Finns answered the questionnaire of Tietoykkönen Oy in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and Bridge series screenwriter to do a series of crimes together
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, a writer who made the popular Bridge series, are working together to prepare a new TV series.
The filming of the ten-piece Advokaten series is scheduled to begin next year.
The Swedish production company Tre Vänner reported on the project on Monday in a press release.
The series was purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Advokaten, based in Stockholm, tells of a young lawyer named Frank who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
The crime writer Lapidus, who came to fame with a money-for-money novel, is a defense attorney from his civil profession.
