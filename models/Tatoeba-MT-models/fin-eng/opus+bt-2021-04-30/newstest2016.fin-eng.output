Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing person report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Night-Says at midnight, knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the after-party.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father told me.
Ronaldo, on the ferocious side, tore a goal gap with Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing also in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid went to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of penalty kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when, before Tuesday, Barcelona Messi, who was equalising with him, has a size of 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League's Pool D it started strongly with a 2-1 guest win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of a knee-difficulty Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's major league game, did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced hard times in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's guest match only lasted 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU pack that attacked the goal so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break in extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The goalmaking season in the Champions League began with Paris Saint-Germain of Pool A.
It was Angel Di Maria, who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG-tuttu, from Argentine.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
The PSG has been placed among the season's successes.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, TsSKA, lost a B block in a match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded resignation - the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
Mugabe apparently did not realize the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only occurred at Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional EU leaders' summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively those who come to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Home Ministers.
The teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call.
The voice just a little vibrating university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the deceased woman's family members can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, police found a handwritten message written on Amy Prentiss's body and on the fly's page: "I'm so sorry I could cancel her love for Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said a letter that experts say is signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to indicate that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometres to the school campus where police believe he shot and killed a teacher in the held history, Ethan Schmidt, to the door of this office.
Lynn Buford, Police Chief of Delta State University, reported that the university staff heard a shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police surrounded the voice.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb’s motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students told me they'd been waiting for her hours.
The police at Prentiss's death scene, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and uneasy, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly Lamb had something in mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled campus, the police were able to track him as he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the suburb of Greenville, told Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a town with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls were melted wax while she was there, now told by 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson suburb Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverfront brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen reported that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together on some gigs.
O'Steen told me his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer of the confused bar near Gautier reports that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performances for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We made fun of each other and threw things at each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led a first-year seminary program for students and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, reported school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the speech director of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, on Delta State campus, there was a candle devotion attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass during which the University Choir sang songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but the dealer of toy and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, compared with 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores and sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a moment of enormous professional importance for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said that the coming documentary film Back in Time's trailer.
The film begins and I think I'm just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Return to the Future film that was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
A return to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me, it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film ever."
Back in Time is available as a video on demand, DVD, and in some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved by armed means
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved armedly", and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support no non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported that he intends to meet the Foreign Ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the ministerial week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus when dealing with the Syrian crisis as they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support poll results showing Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him a wind quail.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to rub Donald Trump off the top of support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the latest 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit number, and some have seriously begun to consider what this means for the nomination possibilities of the real estate king.
The election season is, of course, only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom gained any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump's persistence and began to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a transient step:
Trump's popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, support polls at Monmouth University showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support poll conducted by the University of Quinnipiac in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans reported that they welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "enthusiastic" vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, a favourite of the regime, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of Republican-based voters at national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the president.
According to a survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac, in the state of Iowa, which holds the first party convention, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has a suitable character for the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent feel that his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who was most likely to be appointed a Republican candidate.
Still at the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information Release: Republican Party voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans at this time felt Rick Perry was nominated as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have remarked that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as support against Trump is divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by each 33 points.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump by a large 18-point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said that they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NET poll from Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of Trump's supporters have decided who their vote goes to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46 percent reported that they could possibly change the candidate.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign start speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's mightiness drives Latino voters away from the Republican Party and harms attempts to rebrand.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
The support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they preferred to choose a non-political person rather than one with government experience.
They're also angry at the federal government.
A two-week ago Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "truly angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
The new Labour Labour Party leader Jeremy Corby meets David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn gets up to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs are watching closely his performance.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service, held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has sparked criticism among Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "standing respectfully silent" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Two Newsnight program that he would have urged the Labour Party leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the royal room should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in policies regarding the party's role in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have "cumped up" also within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
At the meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Corbyn said that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the whole roof.
Hours later, Smith, working and pension secretary of the shadow government, stated that the party was "very clear" in that they were only opposed to government plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour Party leader to be faced by David Cameron over the last decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader has promised a new approach to politics and now tells us that he has "enforced" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and has received over 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Hours is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both clever wording and pricking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary, Angela Eagle, is his substitute for Question Hours when Corbyn does not participate, for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also suggested that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on this issue.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theatre that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Hours, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the director's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position with other MPs, although critics have criticised the question hours for becoming just a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Young people without homes are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of the pound rises as the UK's wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and July, British wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009, and was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in rates.
The pound rose to over 1% versus $1,5505, and 0.84% against EUR 1,37330.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the market's most distinctive share and increased by 20 per cent after a competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
The agreement would unite the two largest brewers in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after encouraging news was received from the rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 percent after the mine giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company announced its six-month profit before taxes: an 83% increase to £46,6 million.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages can damage enlargement
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers increases".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the company's higher labour costs, Cowgill notes.
The costs might be related to the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash begins a grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi's industry
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in southern and western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia prior to Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, which are up to 120 stores coming up. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build an IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media as well as through events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA merchants and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Dunsborough ice cream manufacturer Simmo's offer tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on September 29, when this wholesale seller of food, alcohol and hardware organizes the annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia together make up almost 30% of the area of Metcash's IGA stores, with profit margins higher than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
In South and West Australia, shoppers are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the South and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi captures about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first shops.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually for sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 30 stores in the South next year and in the West, generating a turnover of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed costs base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes," Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will decrease by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with its market share falling from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, a manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said on a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash government would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which transmits products to around 1200 IGA resellers, have decreased by 43 % since 2012.
However, the wholesaler stands up for himself, and has invested over $150 million each year in lowering the prices of hundreds of products on a weekly basis to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate stores by increasing the rate of growing fresh food, and bringing to the market a better range of private brands products.
Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis union president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more credit than criticism for his own conduct, says Australian tennis union president Steve Healy.
The younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwittingly made public by Kyrgios in a case where Stan Wawrinka was annoyed by Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to twice separate Kokkinakis from his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another seat in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I think pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the mess," Healy said.
He broke his bat while losing due to a cramp at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he is not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
She is very mature for 19 years, she works hard, fits into the team and so on, and she has never had any problems with other players. She is appreciated in the dressing room, she practices hard, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to join Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still supported the Canberra return to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games rather than all the polemics around [Cyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in the public domain, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public to reflect on these consequences.
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of damming the influx of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of immigrants gathered in neutral territory, and the Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence of their homelands have now erected their tents and settled on a road block between checkpoints in two countries for an indefinite period of time.
But frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants said "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them come from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate must take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after a 28-nation faction failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for 40 000 people seeking asylum who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who spoke with hope of reaching a final agreement - by next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed down and asylum cases can be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence at the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence for part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and point of entry into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing the war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not those who escape from the war, who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-foot (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison penalties for convicted traffickers of human beings.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares emergency," government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the south town of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but journalists at the border of Associated Press have seen heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
The Orban Homeland Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said that the authorities had captured 45 people when they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 already advanced to the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now captured by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a rail wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to intrude.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: National polls show Hillary Clinton's leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed to half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues in a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is squeezing him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (calculated from 58%), and the second Sanders is supported by 27% (retrieved from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but is supported by 15% of the Democratic electorate.
More than five months before the primary elections began, most of the Democrat voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more rigorously than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has increased somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start in the circle of under-50-year-old Democrat voters has been lost, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democrat voters say they are enthusiastically supportive of Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Donald Trump, the Republican number one man, says the same thing for fewer Republican voters (35%).
When asked in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the appropriate experience (16%). The most popular responses then were that now was the right time for the female president (13%) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president has an influence on a possible presidential nomination, 57% of Democrats would like to see him in the race already - although a third disagree.
When asked by Democrat voters who they would choose second to the party's appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, the leadership of Hilary Clinton from Sanders will grow. If Biden comes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the number will be 30.
55% of Democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden stays far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voter has grown.
However, when asked what is most important in the candidate, the democrats put their opinions ahead of voting.
Also, last month, no Democrat didate or potential candidate was considered impossible for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden manages the trio best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democrat voters say that Clinton does not think honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of Democrats say that they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server while he is Secretary of State still raises questions, most of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and say that this did not affect their general opinion of him.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that their overall opinion of Clinton was not affected by e-mail polemics, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although he is considered honest and reliable by Clinton's own party voters, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton does not think that Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters in the whole country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion about him, just as neither does Carson.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national poll
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new poll, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the previous CBS poll before last month's Fox News election debate.
At the same time, however, Carson skyrocketed from 6% to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is ousting Trump among higher-ranked Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10% last month to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are even in third place in 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest September survey is +/- 6%.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson to be rising in polls: he has a 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was also well ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, although Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of Baruch College's first year student
Almost two years after the student died in a fraternity chimp ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of Baruch College University in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed his hospital introduction, thus contributing to his death, the police stated.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a backpack of over 13 kg of sand, and then repeatedly tackled the ground as he attempted to walk through an icy field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurting, and then he lost consciousness.
Members of the fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but the accusations said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search online for information about his symptoms, and contact the National Chairman of the Brotherhood Andy Meng, asking him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told at a press conference.
"Here, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained repeated blunt force traumas to the head, body, and thighs.
"Too many families have had to suffer fraternization when at least one student has died each year as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, stated in his statement.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury argued that the first five members were charged with murder in the third degree
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent bullying and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held accountable only to individuals. If there is an organization behind what happened that either formally or informally accepted the situation, they must also be held accountable," Wagner stated at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dismantled its affiliation with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates
The interest rate increase will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will fall.
We know this.
What we do not know is how long it will take for all of this to take or how long it will take.
The past does little to help with timing, especially as regards the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first withdrawal, while sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Central Bank officials have been so energetic in emphasising that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the cycle of time to normalise the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
At the end of the day, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about interest-raising has been over-compensated.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis in the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles to end the era of ' cheap money'," said Capital Economics' chief economic expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, to be a revolutionary shock that many people seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react in the light of past developments:
As seen in the market over the last month or so, waiting for interest to be increased may make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It appears that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market is generally strong, rising by about 14% as we approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase 2.6%), and the normal state has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reported in a recent analysis by Nuveen Asset Management's leading capital strategist Bob Doll, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle when profits begin to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past and can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case with gross domestic product, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate withdrawal.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5%, reports the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The raising of interest in such a fragile economic setting may be risky and raises the question of "is this time different," Deutsche Bank stated.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the futures trade only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all upward cycles have so far appeared in supercycles of increased leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is running.
The fixed return has also been unstable while the market is waiting to raise interest, and the model somewhat resembles the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The course of the return on debt appears to change immediately at the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will result in a convergence of longer- and shorter-term bond yields, thereby smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about finding a return," Schwab's solid return analyst Kathy Jones stated in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of Dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for a tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, yield curves are more even, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its alignment.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with a lot of debt are less able to do so when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have to finance.
"History shows that 'quality' shares in general are more profitable in the three months after the first interest rate withdrawal," Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover passed weak turnover by enterprises after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
It's gonna be a big problem.
Those companies with high floating interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's rise in value.
Savers can also make profits with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "citizenship"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes more and more difficult
In addition, he targeted BBC Music Awards, saying that they merely imitated the Brit Awards
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticises The Voice, saying that neither is original
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "encourage" its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "people-conscious" - is becoming Classic FM," he said.
He also took his aim at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seems to be a Brit Awards held under a different name.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples of what I remember directly when you actually just copy something that is already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC executive denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival as regards live music and the sharing of information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"In addition, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3, chief Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than previously to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's supply that was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, a music competition that the BBC purchased from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique in any way?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which the star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in particular in the BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "found success inside his own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future The Voice seasons from being produced, or to order that the money of the licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose least in August, Black Friday may be the cause
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month the rise was lowest since the beginning of statistics in 2000
Three years ago online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has increased dramatically for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of online sales levelling as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more reasonable over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales were strengthened as buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as a sofa.
But now it is leveled, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been regarded as one of the causes behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the usual average number of buyers flocked to their computers to capture shops, knocking down the website of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury the dead in Meka's crane accident, the consequences for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
Twenty-nine dead were carried in the air across the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque.
The mainly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the sacred place, where just a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family building group guilty of a disaster that also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by the crane in the great mosque of Mecca, 29 were carried across the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that hajjj Meckana will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane's stem up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English service did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s directors were prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crash of the crane in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage to be held later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements of the crane collapse and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the great mosque of the Mecca, which are part of the huge building robbery run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi dynasty for decades, leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for pilgrimage, which every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities report that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the deceased and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European cheap working workers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants," Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, the Screwfix stores for professionals will open 200 more
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paint balconies and prefer to hire skilled East European workers to do household decoration work
It seems that if you're clever with a hammer or good at painting walls, you're in a minority now.
You see, the British are hiring more and more assistants to do tea-se-self-jobs in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
The new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, Veronique Laury said that the popularity behind it lies the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and closing 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store are specifically made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population need to be taken into account: today there are more one woman's households where more home improvement work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women have a big role to play in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the UK's FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team in such a way that it has as many male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of women in the group, including its Director-General and its Director-General for Finance.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board."
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' profits and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new shops
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad employee protest.
There's a lot of people who think there's reason there, too.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people, millions of trade unions, does not give much thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was a few decades ago.
Not everyone knows the aims of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of Ay movement's operations, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, the union finally brings the matter, namely, worker's rights to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to detain the role of the ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
No matter what you think of the activities of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's head.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Towards a saving of 8.5 million, reducing staff by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a austerity course aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on all personnel with a saving target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million in actual activity.
It is also affected by cuts in appropriations made by the government.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research, as well as a reduction in corporate funding, on our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to gradually open up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is in turn.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank has to make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters polled 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current 0-0,25 %.
This is a historic event, since the central bank has seven years to cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero levels and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The United States economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a lift, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "evil" for the first murder and wished "that he could cancel it," the authorities told on Tuesday.
Mississippi police officer Gautier reported that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 at around 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone", but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss, as well as a note written by 45-year-old Lamb, saying, "I'm so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when the police surrounded him.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly Lamb had something in mind."
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in relationship with Schmidt, there was no "law or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama".
Shawn O'Steen reported that he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good man".
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
O'Steen told me Prentiss and his daughter were "one-time best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from his home online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police reported that Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education in Delta State in spring 2015, reports a CV found on the university's website.
Stars Who Lost Their Attractiveness
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has had a hard time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg with Manchester United losing to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
She was treated for nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United at 18, suffers from difficulties, and then plays brilliantly, and this is what happens.
While I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger."

The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championship in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against the Van Gaal Dutch at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, doesn't he?
Each parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost learn it by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday care service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss's The Lorax book, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps company's website and continues: "Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or a message we have never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next song, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Need, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win to the heart of his dream girl by filling Audrey's wish to see a real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, called Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in places as if it had been taken from the plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database, beginning with the following: "In the city of Need, inside the majors, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win his dreams to the heart of Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so ignorant of the plot of the book. In it, a young, unnamed boy hears how local nature has been destroyed by greedy, tree-cutting and need-weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustache creature that gave the story the name of Lorax, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible public relations mission is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being excluded from the England team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen to tour, I do not believe that a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a team three years ago, but it involves good twisters and the team's thinking is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral pitches and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth fell from the English cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandablely difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choicers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own destiny.
I hope if he gets more runs to Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't do as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a trail.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricketer, he has that something we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must at least be given the same chance as others before him, but this obviously depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeni in a batting opening with Cook, which would get an extra pitcher into the field but could be held four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his duty in his county in Worcestershire, but he is three to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games as the first grid dropped, before entering the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not recall the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, as little as I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unrevealed statistics, hitting average 31, with a ball of 35, and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers available and the selectors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions for the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawarde as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along for the white ball games, and brings both energy and a relentless flash.
I have always thought that he was born to be a part of international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he has the same exploitable intelligence as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and choosing do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
Those in favour of leaving the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic day by day, even if not even the cordial Jeremy "Is it a yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the trade union federation for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of controversial concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they were to undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye, and then come home, saying they will win backers for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward look inside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', says from Berlin - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then we leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her actions before it goes to ruin in the same way as it happened to the too long-stayed Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain may have a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrifice for the selfiebrits when their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers can even consciously plan to make useless remarks like the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"Reconferencing had been organized case" and "Reconferencing had no meaning for Britain".
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU-sceptical the press sovereigns are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed in the ratio 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU direct bananas" while being a correspondent for Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-guilters, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought exactly the same about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, bananas have to be abandoned because of a diversion if you don't want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's renegotiation stunt, namely that Bair had agreed to the principle behind an EU rejected constitution, which was rejected in 2005 by French and Dutch voters, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he no longer had time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of retaking Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott of the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is still forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, which the BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in a renewed Europe.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party Ukip's war goal enthusiasm and the most ferocious nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when his inner patrolman would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law stuck on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's pushes were more tempting.
But the fight to keep up with "any situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in social media vortex, which is a suitable breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the fundamental evasion between McDonnell and Corbyn regarding EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing second-thinkers for whom narcissism of minor differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by British weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting conservative government in power, as I was reminded of at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized Public Health England's electric tobacco assessment
Scientists have said that the government-funded agency's claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had connections with the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric tobacco.
The PHE released this "smile column" report last month, describing it as a "a comprehensive overview of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "exceptionally shaky bottom" of the chief conclusion of the PHE.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say, "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expect that the claim of the PHE "to the best estimate today, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people to develop a multicriteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on harm associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reported to have previously received funding from Bristol American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the manufacturer of electric tobacco, but not from the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they increase.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known supporters of electric tobacco, some of which also say in the study that they have received funding from the industry.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco for the PHE.
The study produced by the group "speakfully admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding disadvantages in most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that the claim made by the PHE that "there is no evidence that electric tobacco serves as a route for smoking children or non-smokers" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being of the PHE, says that claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electricity cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively low, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty over the relative dangers of tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS £2 billion per year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if electric cigarettes are not risk-free, their drawbacks are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 leader
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for such hits as this soap opera on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticizes the BBC for putting public service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, into difficult broadcast times against the most watched programs of competitors and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC executive director Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he once tried Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programs that would clearly fit unsubvented competitors," Johnson stated to the upper room communication committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast to the most important broadcast time because of the desire to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could also be funded without state subsidies.
The Voice is one such and the EastEnders is another, undeniably carried out within the house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur leading Channel 4 in 2004-2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting the number of viewers "because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series similar to the comments of former Sky leader Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience's public service programs "go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fills its responsibilities and then can hypocritically state that 'well, we do all these unknown programs that nobody looks at'".
They put them on a mission site where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson said to the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for the people for whom £150 is big money because they don't spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 leader David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith-time mission "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the task to "to inform, educate and entertain".
As regards partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, are only shown on television, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these can be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" enables brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how shuttleworms change direction as soon as the audio impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them with sound wave bursts.
The tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by an audio impulse that is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic wave-responsive membrane channels.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity with light
Scientists said that the worms show the functionality of a new method known as sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people’s brains are subjected to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Shuttle depressions normally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they are surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He discovered that the bubbles reinforced ultrasound waves, which then travel inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4-ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic shuttle worms, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified carpets, microbubbles reinforced sound waves and transmitted them to carpets where they turned on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetic, pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along optical fiber to the desired location within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus it may be possible to cause targeted human neurons to react momentarily to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Adverts shame Britain's arms trade
Watch the video against the Amnesty International Armoury Fair.
Horrible killer planes!
Ankle-crushing leghold traps!
Grape bombs!
And electrical stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and comic book imagery leave no doubt that this advertisement of the world's largest gun fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for repressive governments at parties held at the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre in the London Shipyard Region.

With the separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and subway trains that require a closer look.
"Strengthening information, Traveling on the DLR route on September 15-18?" is asked together using London's underground font and brand, with DLR track becoming a tank image.
In this September, a group of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route... customers are asked to help stop the gun show.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were featured at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (in the museum of public plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is a £6 package of hexagon keys that the collective says "gets access to a third of the entire bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this unlicensed "poster vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance slopes when they realize that they have to go out into the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-gun poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been watched on Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
The VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin discovered that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement of obscure corporation, but "it was more stoptable to emphasize it with bright colors and animation".
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," Amnesty's Tom Davies says.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL, as exhibitors trade fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in his press release that he had received an order from the U.S. Army for the "at4CS RS to be launched from the shoulder".
This includes a "unique tube charge tip that targets excellent effects behind the armor within the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a dormitory
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dorm when I wasn't aware of 19, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed... and numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything that gets on your nerves to be totally scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, do you have a year off and where you think of Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to take a breath... ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and not those you would not want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they would share extinguishers.
Give people room.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights and high entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting a university when you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories are formed by a culture of room-to-room wandering, which is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you must now leave so that I can collect back the energy I spent when I talked to you."
Try to sense when a college buddy is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when it came to knocking: knock.
A guy at my college dorm thought if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of stuff.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start university during the top season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate baking plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from a -50s type.
Offering self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will link your face to a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask the owner of the milk and check it out.
It's quite possible they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my dormmate who mixed detergent in his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make such noise that people cannot sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot beating on a pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music lower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making her own music roar, locked her doors and went for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered your dormitory partner to be your future spouse, joined together, separated, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm companion is really not your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but can be canceled in no time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer, but don't put their property on the ceiling with a blue sticker than twice at most.
A racist attack on a foreign student's lodging in Kite - A house designed as a reception center was dented in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on the residence of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical People's College at Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodation facilities were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation room, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher of the youth guarantee training at the People's College, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," Luke says.
The People's College accommodates people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has a status.
Some study in comprehensive adult education, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, an information conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," says Lukeka.
According to the reading, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators were suspected to have been at least three men and had been on the way to a light passenger car.
I think this is a young people's weekend whim now that this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo that has been maimed with a reception center.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report from the police.
Specification 15 September at 16:02 Corrected for incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of people living in the building.
The government's going to shut down the Y train to Karjaa... with the passengers on their hands, "just idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karelia stops running in March.
The news annoyed passengers rising to the evening shift of the train at the Helsinki Main Railway Station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is constantly increasing and people in work need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video he will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track are combined into a new R-line.
Purola Station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are left out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström of Siuntio considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes regret.
The Y train is also used by others than the Raseporians and the Siunthians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It is especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he was on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
A new train connection to the beach line is likely to replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This leads to increased costs for HSL, in practice, the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Savi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi reports that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the ministry, of course, much more than this.
The R line on the main track skips two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Sauna Rock, the number of train shifts doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seenäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts are reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made on end-of-life shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the State annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Timeliness book: "It's a good idea to get to know Marx"
The crises in the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his principal work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakane, known as the former Chairman of the SVP, in Marx Capital's book today.
"He is now being taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy into all areas of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of financial capital and imaginary capital have proven to be astonishingly farsighted.
The book's authors list, based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakase, also includes Aalto University's professor, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
However, the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman tells on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
"The usual concept is that the history of ideas tells of the false opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman, however, sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are being discussed.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be brought to an end.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoist and Trotskyans and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as well as other classics," says Korkman.
UN demands war criminals for conviction in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, the armed forces' major attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report requires.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combat.
Both sides have reportedly committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court, as foreign judges.
The English Yo test allowed social media to be considered
The autumn matriculation writings had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject about social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250 word writing could address an online magazine's advisory column to the administrator.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He was to be consulted on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of substance, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic, English lecturer Mia Lybeck, of Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third topic was just a quote from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, according to Lybeck, was all right.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and rated the whole experiment as "pretty normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that addressed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn writings continue on Friday, when the second domestic test, Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is normally conducted, so it is not affected by the employee's demonstration.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the trainees to find suitable transport connections in time for them to arrive at the trial.
You can get extra time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A store was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in the Kello district on Wednesday morning in Oulu.
Police say the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering combopo.
He's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's decision to cut will block the Helsinki city centre on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary reports, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK alliances meet at the Railway Market at 11.
Police are also believed to participate in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the police at work are responsible not only for carrying out the alarm missions and other police activities, but also for ensuring that the giant demonstration is carried out.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9.30 to 14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisanniemi roundabout, from the west direction since Mannerheimintie.
Do you have enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For the time being, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on a cop's industrial battles.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland because of the demonstration.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
"Something is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police urge you to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic dump extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning of the evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also many buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed on the Railway Market.
As a rule, buses remain at a distance.
The rest of the journey must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in various parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not have a very good benchmark in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siiäinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Soviet.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The hard grips of the government are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here about the fact that the ay movement is actually being tried to get to its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the ay movement does not by any means have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the protest will bring about in the group that the ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
In November 1993, unemployed persons from different parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a 1993 Murrostorstai, says Siivainen.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (center) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organizations had never been as bad before as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is perhaps even worse than in the time of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the very bourgeois government of Finland is now in power, says Siiäinen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite the speeches made by the Finns.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
While the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
Approximately 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish ay protests have been quite peaceful - even though policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property," says Siiäinen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firefighters lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike of metalmen.
The strike was suspended by a settlement commission motion after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metalmen received a 16% raise in pay.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of them made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliament House to express their opinion in favour of work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The strike of firefighters was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, EU quits", was one of the slogans.
To Espa, the farmers fell a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened by strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass secession ultimately accelerated the negotiations to the end.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of strikers in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and caused a lively discussion on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested the assistance of the Central Criminal Police in the investigation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We have had exchanges of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to the first public radio report on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among others, and its CEO is a man with foreign background, about 40 years of age.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain who beats refugees, a former drug courier, and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, who works at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book The Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat them right out of here.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia are not attractive to foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head for that summer celebration.
The islands are also excellent for smuggling because the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing on his blue, ten-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If you fill a boat, you can fit 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients for him across Tunisia.
Guests arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with a torch turned off.
On the first night, you drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in the 20 - foot [20 m] waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir goes on a return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the hangers to death.
He tells in the book that when the police once caught sight of him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I picked up customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He says he's gonna have to assault his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat them out of here right now.
We need to show them right away who's in charge here.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is just a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - starter engine pulls its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
Men who travel without their family in the woods around the centre are housed in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovaða area, a large hub of human smuggling, people are dead tired.
Goran's drivers are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly fool all the way.
First the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles, most of it comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and throws away.
The Work of Kindness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, attended by many believers who fled the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are moved from Congo to Europe.
He considers himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car, and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that it is advisable to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money a bit, and swoop among merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we come from war zones such as those in North Kivu, and that we have had to flee our homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
It helps the missionary's contacts with Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, eventually the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He will charge separately for each step: submission of an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, handling documents for the humanitarian organisation about EUR 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country, EUR 4 500 to EUR 7 000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is an aspiring smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his early 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
In the night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the freeway to the resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cut the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police thermal scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not smite the stowaways, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporka, the Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only claims the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scheme: Turkish ports rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships are being loaded into a crowded area of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul to land in a port and then to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd in sight.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ship journey after costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
In the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through covert companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a MP of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone missing.

American Olympic runner reports in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, a 1,500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and drifting into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran in the qualifying for the second best time.
However, in the final, he panicked.
From the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was depleted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and was passed by by other rivals one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with foreign men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was also that he missed the same adrenaline spikes as he had had while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner became apparent in late 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was world statistical number one at 1500 metres at 3.57.40, but was the last in Sydney Olympic finals.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski cock in check: "From the straightback"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the sports contract throughout the summer and autumn last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision received praise from two world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski cock in check.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season from the national team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations, and will not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, in which he asserted that he wanted to have sports in Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup as well as then at the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, of which two gold medals.
He was part of the team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
The plate day of the roast translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D., 25 September, there will be raptures in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted the Baking Translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all the high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an independent operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received at the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
An Old Town restaurant is taking part in Kokkola's shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, which will take place in the same day across the world.
Finland continues to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: A complaint to the Attorney General about the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a reception centre for refugees in the premises of Kauhava's former garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis period is still in permanent location in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Ltd.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has also not been clarified when preparing the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been taking place over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and on the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy, among others.
The individual states to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the incorrect location envisaged in the former garrison area.
Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center case last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters in the evening after meeting the chairpersons of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the Russian and US activities in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also ignored in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is told that the operations of airports will be managed by the supervisory forces during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki
A demonstration on Friday will close the streets of Helsinki.
Police report that the streets leading to the Railway Market will be closed to cars at approximately 9.30-14.
From the direction of the Mannerheiminti, no cars are allowed to enter Kaivokatu, Postikatu and Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu, the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisanniemi roundabout.
According to police, the period of closure depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The tram and subway staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the Starts close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Post services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is carried out despite the strike.
There is also an effort to deal with catering and hospital broadcasts and laboratory samples.
Information on situational services can be found on the Post website.
Most of the Starts of Finland close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 13 p.m.
Pam has also called on employees in the grocery trade to participate in the demonstration of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open by superiors if necessary.
According to Kesko, no information is yet available on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki Daycare Centres partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres do not function to their full extent on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency.
Due to the protest of trade unions, day care is possibly concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds are not organised.
Daily day care centres and groups of children with mental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Office of Early Education promises to report further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media Investigator: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the PM's television and radio talks become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio talk be given to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 9.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the Yle Arena.
The Cinnamon's taking a big risk
The media scholar hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell about a more general government's inward turn.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into its own hands and refuse to raise questions about a public debate?
Reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are not connected.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communication styles are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of media representatives, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
Koivuse says TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there any more we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
Even the general takes a risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A Shrewd Bet from the Clover
In the forthcoming speech of Sipilä, it is also important what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we should look closely where Sipilä is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, as this allows him to bring out his own vision without gravel sounds.
In this way, the message will be received by the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because more specific questions will not be allowed to be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV, whether the sweat leaks, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners regularly engage in (U.S. President Barack).
That's really extraordinary.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
According to him, there has been no such thing in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations organize demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Spovo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed as well.
Antti Rinne (sd.), chairman of the SDP, again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy has been found and told, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to the Evening Journal.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create anger
A Kurdish-back free fighter, Makwan Amirkhani, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Mr Amirkhani spoke heavily against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells us that he is disappointed in the fad of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick down on the ground, sit on the other one, and beat blindly without thinking of any of these consequences, as you make videos like this, Amirkhani upgrades.
It's hard to justify any more.
Some of the young people on the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police, fighting videos for social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
The very fact that you're fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come to a very large extent.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you any more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, fellas.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives stakes to racism.
You make me hate something I don't like either.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
GERMANY takes a stand on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The Chairman of the GERMANY, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that on Monday, the employees' organization will reflect on its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK reported that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, the Chairman of the SAK, commented with little words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipilä's government for a social contract was not acceptable to the GERMANY.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social contract when the GERMANY refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: A grand demonstration threatens to blow up - "It seems a little funny to shake a fist"
It's a little funny to shake a fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary in the wage and salary camp from side to side.
Is it the intention to call the government down or, after all, to settle with it?
On Monday, the Federal Leaders of the SAK burst with holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavals.
The Teachers' Trade Union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of STTK, Antti Palola (sd) appeared arbitrarily.
He reported that he had kept in touch with the government and drafted an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his settlement papers were ready.
At first, there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the lock on the labour market".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Idealus, head of STTK's social influence previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As Palola described, the government's ay competence has been improving all along.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit off the Finnish seismics, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
You know, it's kind of funny to shake a fist if you already have a piece of reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified 6 p.m.: Added information on lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma Sergey Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, has begun, at which Naaryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to come to the meeting - something the President pointed out to journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation reached uncomplicated, so Naaryshkin continued to inject Finland with praise and praise for the "excellent organization" of Mongolia.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to Russian media, has already discussed the meeting with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The Astara and the Clave today continue the bull days in the Haka Forest when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti anticipated that today, in Haka Forest, there would be no actual goal party.
Tapara visited Kuopio yesterday to carve a 3-2-continuation win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
There were round zero points as a guest of the blues, which had started loosely, and a loss rate of 2-3 as well.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The Astara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
In fact, in the previous two seasons, the Astara has just dropped in the semifinals from the Lock Finals series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tapara rose to the next three alongside and past.
There are no major changes in the formations of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers who both rejected yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
With the goal of the Astara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bearhus, and between the Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A bad play going on in Ace
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Iron Rock, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the lead.
In a sensational way, the underdog put up a heavyweight for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled Cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden-handed patpack proceeded to everyone's surprise at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori's Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
The Hope Child became blonde.
A fine TV commentator, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's renewal works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for Aces has built a pot on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky's pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are credited with something other than puck playing.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Iron Rockio is as clumsy in Rocky, written by Toivola, as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of Äss tackled Tapara's Jere Karelian head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game and it's not part of the ace puck, the hot Iron Rock snapped after the game for the People of Satakunta.
This season's team is oddly built.
There's a bunch of kids, veterans, cops, and promotions.
In practice, there are no key men of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in becoming the sports boss of Toivola.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season has as many losses as the goal difference of 1-6.
The Toivolan should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna Made Us Beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Cricket.
Cricket tsmaps and supports his son, although his father Ricky (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, they've talked on the phone, they've been texting.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Cricket was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
There was a depression in the '90s, and it was so dreary.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga reports that he had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola's notorious skate story of known Tuukka.
Olga was a weekday and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka in the movie.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga says he's been working with Tuukka so much over the past 10 years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything's always gone super well.
Now the entire production team goes to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iit often plan to drive home for the sake of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They have received us so warmly, simply asking, which streets and when will be emptied?
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
The sequel of Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play film ever made in Finland with its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been in the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion past Iron Sky 2, as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
Filming by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near Antwerp in AED Studios premises and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scary.
I've been so sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
However, 100 million would be added to the film because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's not one loose one.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond today on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov among others.
What do you mean, "dick" or "cool"?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of Trend Setters have recently been adorned by big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the label of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen as a somewhat hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportism has become a real fashion megatrendi, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the line between funny and trendy is glimmering: if something's right, it's starting to turn into ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which the trend setters surprised by preferring as dull basic clothing as possible as a means of separating themselves from the mass.
Instead of the grey basic college, the sweater shirt is already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' recognisable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos of panties are now a cool detail.
The trend appears to be shifting from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s fall sweaters makes clear the mark of the garment.

The Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to disengage the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on their pictures, it is not a matter of being stuck or angry.
That's a lot of nonsense.
Let's start by not going inside the battle tank, but the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on the Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov, on the Russian Army's TV channel, explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he himself was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I definitely intend to visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and robust, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photos of alleged stuckness have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started in the beginning of a Bloknot.ru site case where Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank door in an attempt and threatened eventually to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up case in which exhibition organizers reported their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä Mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand basin to the ditch.
The company says that measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains enriched sand and purified process water neutralized by the foaming process.
In general, the water is either pumped to be reused as process water or passed through a surface casting field to the environment as authorised.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic feet per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the reservoir dam structures has been observed.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report released today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) broadly reflects the views of the Government and the Treasury.
The organization was struggling with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist, Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a great deal of message in the IMF's assessment of the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says for Economics.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in its new forecast for the economic cycle, anticipates growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest observations as a basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in total output in the summer," says Kuoppamäki.
Again, less attention has been paid to the weakened trust in industry or to other so-called softer measures.
However, differences are only a matter of a few percent of decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under the death of cancer Satoru Iwata, starts working on Wednesday, Nintendo reported Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima is tasked with taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
An increasing number of minors arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are lost every year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector General of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear in "under country" per year?In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the course of the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of an adult age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made with a lapse decision because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is it growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on minors missing this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants for minors is therefore well known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons missing, he stresses.
What will happen to those who take the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear to the "dark labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered land seekers.
He has taken action.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see images of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to sickness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online announcement was first reported by the online magazine Evening Makasin.
Today, much of the equipment has been left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current Stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who made a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Stormylä in boxes.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The subway and tram drivers decide today whether to expand their force measures in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop subway and tram traffic only during a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says he's big on the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift supplements sting the drivers badly, so government plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders that stopping traffic all day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area is virtually completely blocked.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There's no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the depot.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, run by superior forces, the HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus runs on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
Sky News says refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas. The teacher thought the self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered the self-made watch he brought to school a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the watch to look just like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a "film bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic council wonders if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is rumbled - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms of the right-wing press have also been shared by representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green felt Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial ceremony honored the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown his respect to the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroics of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and increased public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament as party leader during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron rhymed on Twitter at the turn of the week with Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
South Lake Mintonka police have soon investigated a week of family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on 10 September and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for a checkup and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, police chief of South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the acts of blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his property on the social media site for nurses AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site weekly.
I've been made 50 buy-ins over the past ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Success was reflected in, among other things, the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a fancy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream in Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Legal proceedings pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Acieve Test Prep, who offered various pre-papping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments had been removed from Short's website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether Short's transactions would have been affected very significantly by the trial.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos month horse owner award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented with a good spirit on his honor board.
Celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros in winning.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, coach Korpi of the successful horse will gain full work peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll shut the fuck up, Loiri.
An amazing gesture from the NHL star - "The biggest athlete of all time donation"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about $6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year and $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby holding his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a giant sum of money for another city's large hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research to the hospital.
You can order a wife at a Japanese cafe for the evening. You can serve dinner in a bikini and an apron.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe on the market, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It strikes the lonely, the club-grubbing, and the hungry.
There's news from Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening at the Ore no Yome (My wife) café in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
She's just going to be wearing an apron and a bikini, and a husband in tight bike shorts.
The website offers all information about the length and weight of the candidates for wives to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's press release.
The Board consists of top security experts from around the world.
AsRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future based on ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve car cyber safety," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been waiting years for the moon to rise.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released information on RS now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS speeds up due to its 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed is 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, preliminaryly reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his press release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features in Frankfurt's car show - such are the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing street SUV market, is certainly more important than the two innovations in Finland.
Sportage, created under Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
The wheelbase and external dimensions have come a centimetre here and there, and the car splits air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but added a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
It will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimos, equipped with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, are at the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage, splattered in a brave jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a spectacular open cleavage.
The costume beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer's star.
The whole is crowned by a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has lost a pound of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year.
The singer released her first single from a new record in August.
Back to the platforms and standing in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really nervous.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release his new and at the same time fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounded again - now you see the breast
Real-TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics one after another.
He presents his pregnancy stomach and chest equipment generously in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the concert of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flashes flash.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last Friday, when the introduction was in the pregnancy belly.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to spell out that the model world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you did pose in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with conkars.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take up a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to drop the pounds, but then they say in Paris you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a gamble all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is dim.
Models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a display of clothes.
Even models want to be their own persona.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
Fashion Weeks are currently being celebrated in New York City, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band's founding member, based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's all right that I'm just learning his style of playing on video.
I don't want to make an impression on a person.
A man piloting the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band is not leaving for the role.
The Punk-manners come with the man naturally.
In the punk episode of the Stars and Stars program, I'm sure many people saw a preview, just like if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything subtle, but always goes to the fullest.
The lead actors in the film Make Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in 1993-2004, were announced today.
A core group familiar to the audience of the band is presented to the general public by still quite unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already released a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in mustaches and chin beards, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents in recent days have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to force the issue, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, and not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed," he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about them elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated in vain, even if it is distressed and frightened.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring up the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, along with the children, can reason on how to view this in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational viewpoints - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.

It's hard to contain the ball lightning that hits the Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to sand Clover's ball salama to a tumult in midsummer.
It only ran wins and second positions until the collapse of the Tampere raves at the end of July.
Since the stallion collapsed thoroughly, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest head, but it took two medical courses to overcome it.
Since Clover's ball flash had to be on light exercise, the North states that it is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku in its record time after the Taruntuuli.
The clover’s ball flash was under great pressure from the break, having only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
In view of those things, a slight deflection at the end was understandable," says the North.
The coach assumes that a good race made the stallion a bit of a kick.
The horse must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have evened out.
The clover's ball flash has been so-called humorous horses.
When you don't feel like it, you can't even get fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has been separated from the throttle of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
At a short speed, co-competitors can't handle the ball flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
In the hopes of the North, Vermo has a nest run.
The difference is, however, how Clover's Ballbolt agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might even get stuck under the boom of the starting car and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer now than the departure of Turku.
The clover's ball flash can also come from the bow when it's fine, and we're going to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine, the company's CEO.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example, come to mind.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks on the top.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it may cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into it, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation declined to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate from a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU 28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in August by 1.4 per cent in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far removed from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is close to a price increase of 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1% next year, the central bank anticipates its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
U.S. Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed resumes to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And in financial markets, the decline will begin before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he might be starting interest withdrawals already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market pace before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have done - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money claims as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, by using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what might result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile condition to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have all along the summer and early autumn hinted that time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in more than nine years can be made this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Management of Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage points interest rates, with which Fed increased its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years at a time.
The financial market symptoms began in 2007 with difficulties in housing financing the most risky in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy began slower than has typically occurred since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than once since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950 and in places since the beginning of the 19th century.
As of the 1950s, they report on Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The beginning of the recession has taken less than one year since the first interest rate withdrawal, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one to two years of the beginning of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has alternately increased and reduced its steering rate after the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the review, so it is hardly possible to determine the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
The strategies therefore point out that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be indisputably identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and the reasons for its increasing destructive power are somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low in the 2000s for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks, and at the same time they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive debt to various parts of the financial and real economy grew even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The largest debt bubble in the economic history of the past arose.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost imperceptible to the financial economy, swelled most parts of the financial market with the largest price bubbles from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in the history of the economy so far.
Nor is there much controversy about the fact that the financial markets which rose to higher levels on the basis of ever more complex debt levers were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
Financial structures geared to debt, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted only a while after interest withdrawals had begun and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give cause for thought by, for example, mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now considered the stance of their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time debt has not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not become lighter, but is now considerably heavier in various parts of the economy than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former less favourable and less costly central banks has mostly remained on the financial market and has been the most expensive of key types of securities and assets, whether the peak before or at any time before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategists flattened the mood with financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the model that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks on the financial markets are comparable to those before the financial crisis when Fed next begins to tighten up his cash flow.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, a strategy by the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time been coaching international investor clients of the bank Fed for the following full-turns:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to rush to shut down the financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP Business Services, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales in November, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer pc machines and printers.
HP's staff peaked at its peak in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard from Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP plans to relocate its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is anymore responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
Still the other year, its three most important customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system for your iPhone after Apple update release
A new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, clicking on the "General" and then selecting the "Program Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems since this installation when a "Program Update failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications for space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the upgrade and also facilitating the process with a new tool that proposes removeable applications and then reinstalls them when the upgrade is completed.
It is worth making sure that the phone is loaded or near the charger during the upgrade that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the upgrade to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it may lead to a breakdown of the upgrade.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a notice of resignation for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed time frame," says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Board of Directors and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings run through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capitalist with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context," says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not associated with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' equity fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is home to a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first company-run reception centre is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening six.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation College.
The operations are operated by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the centre.
STK is preparing an alternative labour market tightening package
The STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the Government's tightening up of working life.
The organization also hopes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative measures to reduce the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola remarked to reporters during a hiatus of the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity for discussions.
STT's economists have calculated that the security of change contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared with 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's such a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're about to have one relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has wanted alternative presentations by Wednesday, as then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement some of the blackmails.
According to STTK, Palola does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP, which has featured the issue.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
STK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to the protest, and the intention has not been to organise the strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, commends the STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK now comes to the same lines with Akava, as an alternative model for government performances has been outlined in Akava for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STTK reported earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive jump by the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the country's government and employers," Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech marking the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's address instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train runners' strike with a television talk.
Solitude, monarchist stuff.
Sipilä’s speech has sparked criticism and speculation all day about what is going to happen.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated on Twitter that "Sipila could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed as well".
According to Greens Ville Niinistö, "one-off has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Koomija of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "A short six months after the election.
No appearances from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's @juhuasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was a public service mission to promote publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news by Ismo Silvo Yle, the director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like us in Tammel time ♪
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
Mom puts on a cuter hat and Dad compromises the tie on her neck.
At 9 a.m., they quiet down to television as they used to at Me Tammels time," writes bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
For what Sipilä says, one guess is made by Viva, the Green Left of Tampere University.
It has released an accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to get Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to renounce power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan to allow al-Assad to give up power in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed to him in a bilateral debate the plan of three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad immediately had to have a speaking connection and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of them, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted the message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is hesitant about the speeches made by Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected, even then, that it would have been Putin's trick to keep power on some supporter of al-Assad.
The Refugees — Our Own Works
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum seeker's organization centre is going to Tornio
The organization centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center would be established in an empty Tornio joint lyse building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has looked for a suitable place to provide better control of the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present a school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specified to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the conference.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint act at a time.
An expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense," Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the holiday money in the public domain would only account for part of the government's effort to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were seeking compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a means of working, as it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut-off of Sunday supplements.
The labour market organisations could agree between themselves to cut holiday money because it is recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a Government Communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work then starts to move, so the train is on the move and it is becoming more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time now.
It won't take long for such things to happen, if there is a will, the Sipilä formulated.
The list released last week by the government includes the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of illness are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, a number of trade unions have declared political strikes because of the actions.
Lake Tohma Council approved expansion of the Mahalahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, which was slightly murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also, a busy schedule with a heart attack.
It was also wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the last extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous firm stance to bring Karelian street names to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after a new decision, no Karelian street name signs will appear in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of Karelian language is also worth being open-minded at a time when multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of these can well be utilized in the variety of marketing in the province.
Discontinuation of rail links cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the province's life force with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the business life and competitiveness of the province.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not have the chance of being reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the abolition of these transport links on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of access links poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkrinen says that even at the moment it is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because traffic connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of students from the University of Eastern Finland are currently coming from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, around 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sounds for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siu social project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is also included.
A member of the City Board, Pentti Centralsalo (sd., in the picture) presented the abandonment of the entire project at the Board's Monday meeting, but his performance fell unsupported.
The Board approved a proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Eagle to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is left out, but still five times a day can be reached from Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are being cut off altogether.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys bailed.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed to the roof from the wedge, who could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on the Ketotie at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs adjacent to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others swerved from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to help with the towing ladder the last one safely left on the roof back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit twofold, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its most recent quarter, and the delivery giant cut its profit forecast throughout the year, due to reduced demand for freight services and higher costs of its ground services.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock of Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May at $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, reported in FactSet's poll.
The lower outlook came despite an average of 4.9% price increases, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite higher additional charges on the land transport of heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said that it expects the operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, turnover has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "successfully performs, taking into account weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holiday were announced the day after a competitor UPS reported that he intends to hire between 90 and 95 000 extra employees, about the same amount as it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx had a profit of $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
Profits per share came at $2.42, which remains from a $2.44 average forecast. A survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but the income of the operations was essentially the same due to the costly costs of larger parcels and own insurance.
The revenues of the Express unit were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations declined by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares decreased by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down for this year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
Governors of the U.S. Central Bank will be sitting around a huge mahogany table this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, the President of the Central Bank, and her colleagues must put the nation's financial interests above everything else.
Congress has laid a dual responsibility on the Central Bank: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Depression, the Governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the data show a steady economic growth, recent turmoil in the global financial markets may have made the already cautious central bank officials even more alarmed as to how to increase instability, and how it would affect if the federal funds rate were raised even in the quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandingly, labour markets and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert of the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they seek justification for the retention of interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is sufficient reason to wait still," he says.
There has been no agreement on the decision of the central bank, which is already creating a nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, approximately half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only around 30%.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228,89 points, or 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must make a lot of effort in their policy to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that a higher level would reassure the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the stability of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen has stated in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the Liberals calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the Central Bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of a pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the Central Bank's 2% annual target, the central bank's decision-makers say that the main reason for this is the temporary effect of significantly reduced oil prices.
The economy "explains even higher interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the tight situation in the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, the chief financial expert for Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record when investors feared China's economic slowdown would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak of May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turbulence is an additional factor in a complex equation that indicates when interest rates should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and the news of the weakness of China's economy over recent weeks, policy makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Olier, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate specialist and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
"The possible impact on the US economy is still quite unclear, and they have little information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China," Olier states.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the insinuation of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank can "never" increase the amount of money, caused revolutions in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, the Central Bank's officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) in Richmond, Virginia, remarked this month that "the Central Bank has previously overreacted to the financial market movement, which seems to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the Central Bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "without worrying about its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to financial stability only during a major crisis, as said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The latest turbulence does not come near its level," Posen says.
"No one wants to face a situation where interest rates are feared to be raised because the market is upset," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Children’s Disease Organization in Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Children’s Disease Organization SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to get women to understand the importance of good nutrition during breast feeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts that have been painted with illustrations of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients necessary to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favourite in ratings, despite the efforts of the Nine channel to announce a leader's exposure on Today Show
The rush of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership revelation failed to increase today's ratings.
The morning program for the Nine channel was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armyage, was stuck in London as part of the series of international broadcasts lasting that week, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance from ballast did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 Today.
Today's average increased slightly compared to Monday's (317 000) and last Tuesday's (283,000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been catching Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today's average was 318 000 and Sunrise's 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far during September, Sunrise's average is 349 000 viewers, compared to 314 000 for Today.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The changes in the winds this morning are blowing away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news of the Seven channel was a 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which collected a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is alone in carrying the popular series without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
Seven channel The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
Seven had a dual destiny on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe gathered a mid-middle of 446,000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - which was a small win enough from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer average was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour had a staggering 720 000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
A fall in the second-night average of The Chase Australia brings confidence to Nine channel that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the ratings of McGuire's program.

The final trio agree with the fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret is revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins The Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been kept extremely secret, with which Sam Wood ends up together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls certainly won't slip who got the last rose.
However, while discussing Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, however, they could inadvertently give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women threw themselves into poetry when they told how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family dignity and positiveness as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?", their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since the first day.
"From the moment I walked in the house, (Sarah's) energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really earthy, it's fun to be around him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be great for a couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now in this with all my heart," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.
Originally released as "Sarah's best option for Sam Wood?"
Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open day of practice at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose for the San Francisco 49ers squad as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kickback as the team won Minnesota on Tuesday by 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight kick and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new arrivals a patala in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne in a post-game press conference.
49ers' special editor Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flight kick that the Minnesota Vikings captured in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and her numerous Australian fans hoped for for a man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen swearing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told the Australian radio pair coach Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping with his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own finish area led to Queensland's goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo released on her Instagram account with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on the Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed while police shot rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's new draft constitution, the authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the highest official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
This week, legislators have voted on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that a new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60% chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
On the wide low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verdean island group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the United States National Hurricane Center reported Tuesday.
On the second sharp low-pressure front, located midway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, there is also a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google begins a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees from Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it announced the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being notified by the leader, his personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven with her family.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations receive four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it corresponds with the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5,5 million, with an overall target of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, ravaged by the war.

Weight loss surgery may help slightly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after a diet surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"Death information takes a long time," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a diet surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in the JAMA Surgery periodical.
Different methods of reducing stomach size are used for weight loss or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the subjects in the study have been pathologically obese and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, for the medicinal treatments of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of persons who were cut fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 people who were treated with other means than surgery.
In 36% of people who had been cut, diabetes improved completely and in part by 28%.
By comparison, in the medically treated group diabetes only improved completely by 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides as well as "bad" LDL cholestor "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors stated.
The investigators also followed the long-term haemoglobin A1c levels in patients’ blood, which reflect blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this better "glycaemic control", as illustrated by improved haemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, reports Chief Scientist Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7% and 14.2 kg), decreased more than its body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased the haemoglobin A1c level more (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer life for heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese patients undergoing weight loss surgery had a 29 - percent lower probability of dying over a 15 - year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI below 35 and who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial in that they show that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group", and there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time when the patient BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that a real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
Dalai Lama dealt with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even the continents.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis, although admirable, is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the German and Austrian actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a position on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After 9/11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem would be through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, children's ingestion of hand-disinfectant has increased four-fold
Poison centres across the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase in the ingestion of alcohol-rich hand-disinfectant in children under 12 years of age since 2010, reports Georgia Poison Information Centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Poison Information Centre, cases of ingestion of disinfectants reported to the Poison Information Centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children become more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are going to emergency services," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or respond to a challenge in social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap uplift.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouth water to get a stronger drink.
Comfortable odors of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handwash) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in small children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," the director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Information Center, Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please don't leave a shot of whiskey on the table, but hand-disinfectant is left in plain sight, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of adult DUI, reports emergency police clinic physician Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed while talking and could not walk when he arrived in the emergency room.
The doctors followed him overnight in a separate children’s hospital in case of possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and move the disinfectant away from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and denied it from her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "flexible babble" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor mill: No conflict on Celtic
Griffiths downgrades talks about Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he makes it turn.
Hearts fights the Scottish Football Federation for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is wary of the January recruitments that can disrupt team unity
Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points
The first half of Adam Rooney's penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths minimizes the talk of contradictions
There have been rumours of intra-Celtic conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under closer scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "The Holland no longer shows the highlights of Celtic's games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tension, and also non-Scotlanders want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to the ten men who played for Aberdeen, now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard against January player transfers
Although just a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented on possible targets for January player transfers, he is wary of the recruiting frenzy, asserting that he does not want to confuse the unanimity of the gang.
The former Brentford boss said, "The transfer window for January is very different from the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire period before, which is visible to our team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can cause more trouble.
Celtic's interest in Michu hints of retirement
Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football Federation due to Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was already the third red card condemned by Collum in the last eight months, which was overturned.
Neilson remains behind what he said, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was rebuked after admitting to singing an offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Edinburgh's derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," the attacker said, adding, "It's about safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, unless I then move on to play for Celtic."
The Tannadice government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy with "ugly victory" in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdee, desperately hung in on the game against Hamilton Accies, but succeeded Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty kick to achieve his seventh consecutive league victory that raised them to the top of the table with five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have won games like this."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's total increase
UNEMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164,000 people remained in the period from May to July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, the figures of the National Statistical Institute (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over a period of three months, and the number of people in work now stands at 2,612 000.
During the quarter, the employment rate in Scotland fell to 74%, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly one year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention of any kind, I will see the man executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary jail watching Richard Glossip executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than available places, participants are selected through a horrendous draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever's elected will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner the way he wants you to, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "could have set his words better," but still feels that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that if he did.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcasts I've made for the show.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aiding.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view from which I watch him die.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other journalists there who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River after a watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry as he lured the man away from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water only meters away from the policeman who tried to "tangle him gently back to the beach."
On Tuesday, the Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham for trespassing.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming out, come get me'," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police conference".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and attempted to swim across the Swan River River.
He failed in his attempt, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the suppliers attempted to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has argued that the officials of Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate their spies in his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the agents and Racing Victoria's incorruptibility division, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late abandonment due to a treatment operation on race day was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has come into a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control with regard to spy claims for a year and a half, and did not want "it to look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Previously Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he reported that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man... I named him when asked... and offered him a job in my stables if he would pass on information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulton, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to become manned and perhaps pass on responsibility to more than coaches for what is happening in this field?
Am I harmful to the business?
Am I that harmful to the business?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I am now saying may possibly cause them to think about that.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I'm pushing them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has increased with a long-standing Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection led him to find that he could "screw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule "be ridiculous" after the mud or clay tomb has been put on the horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud in his leg.
It could have had a poultice last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be facing a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race's pecuniary treatment from which the trustees began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about a horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver involved in driving in Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic break after colliding with a cyclist on the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he received serious injuries when the car crashed into him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalia reported himself to the police in Sheppardon.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other traffic offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team tackles would be part of the "lining".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm's " wrestling" on its own side when it unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualification. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "show window" and said the two Queensland teams were not "hardly excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" as they tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was increased by two leading coaches criticism of Storm, as it means that they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks, we have only emphasised contact in tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "stupidly".
Wayne's talking about an exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 when St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has quick young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also remarked that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more scoring than played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting breach of the defensive line and not scoring?
For me, it's all about policies.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronu Sharks for the pre-final next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
For a Serb man, $200,000 in bail for a drug charge.
A man threatened with a possible life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for a bail amount of $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drug to the Solay yacht, who came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at a Comera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilos of drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic is threatened by a potential life sentence in an attempt to hold the amount of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic attempted to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was attempting to escape.
"He has close ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about the place he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a $200,000 bail to secure her release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that setting a bail amount of $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to stop him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and maintains his curfew between evening six and morning six.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous immoral images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing and found it asleep in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
When the police came in, they saw five pictures, examined the computers on the scene, and found "concerned" web searches with search words used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "playing as a police officer to frighten them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told the Sheriff Court of Dundee the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on the computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking he was sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried to her mother, trembled and cried.
Mother saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she reported that the accused had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger to her.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking pictures of immoral children on June 14, last year. He violated his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be entered in the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "substantial sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social action has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest leader of Africa, Mugabe, fell earlier this year on the stairs leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus in social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with interlocutors while he was giving a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message's title is 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step outside, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "in concern" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing business hardware and service activities.
The expected job cuts bring about a cost of about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, the HP bulletin said.
"These restructuring actions enable a more competitive and sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," stated Meg Whitman, HP chairman and CEO, who leads the unit after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion and "focuss on producing unmatched integrated technology solutions" for companies, reported in the company's press release.
Jako demolishes a company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a graduate of Stanford University University, to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in a field based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending next summer's European Championships.
The greatest pity for this most recent problem is that the end of Wilshere last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season there is always the risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal's 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider overall after the 2007-08 season, in six seasons out of eight it has been one of the Champion League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their improvements to the injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when returning from an injury can be a predisposed period, when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body stabilizes, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will make the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team as Arsenal begins his Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Artatha are likely to be in the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a breather to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favorite of block F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
The stadium was quaked on Tuesday night by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned a lesson from the surrender of last season's Champions League against Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 for men's year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when it was needed.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 secondary school and high school students showing signs of depression. According to the study, a person's chances of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "healthy in mind".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved in the likelihood of possible mental problems if they had healthy friends.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this social media through communication time, style goes past content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by the values that psychologists call externality: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of inner yearning - that contribute more deeply to our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The fineness of the Friends was just that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came out of the fact that yes, men can identify with all of this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can make them feel better."
Often, men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you see as weak.
The Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide more long-term coping methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position at the other end of the phone helps people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a nearby, personal family and friends network.
And so if you attend Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all filming sites are redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why not take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
The Friends are broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan for goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before finally increasing their head start with Cavan hitting the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, in the same Pool A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a post-place, but also an improvement in their games leading to their quarter finals in the final three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Laurent Blanc's team lost the place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy in the Champions League to win at home or guests, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for your opponent and look good in statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we'll have to refine this season," Blanc said.
This is a good prospect.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after injury for one of the three changes made after the team remained in a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but he was shaded by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when running Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland to the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big victory from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. It won Celtic in the settlement game when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and five-man defenses as well as two players deep in the midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went by a pinch from Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost assists and bad finish, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed overall in five attempts in the first half alone and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch right at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing pre-work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent out a twist kick that tilted around Wiland's goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of the game thanks to Cavan, who struck his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had snapped forward from the left of Maxwell's cross pass.
That ended Malmö's hopes of getting back in the game, and only the brilliant fight against Wiland for David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the exchange was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG were as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our latest Champions League game was in December of last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'm gonna lift the hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining industry was left by Glencore, who suffered a price collapse of commodities, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported in his announcement that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts a strain on demand and destroys all markets.
The new entry put Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in the morning stores on Wednesday.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed the previous week as part of a $2.5 billion share deal as part of its wider plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns over the long-running stagnation of Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while at the same time prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement published by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
X's first official visit to Washington takes place on 25 September and is a response to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
U.S. President and Presidential Wife Michelle Obama arrange dinner for X and her spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of President X allows for the expansion of cooperation between the United States and China in a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President X to discuss constructively matters where there are disagreements," added the Lausunno.
During a visit first announced in February, Xin is also expected to deviate from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous US technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN September General Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss numerous controversial topics, including Washington's concern regarding China's alleged online espionage and the country's increased candidacy in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downgrades diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed a difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In the HBO Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives as regards the dark-skinned main character of the selected script for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not the show," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted unbeliefly to the injured, commenting "Oh! wow. Okay", while the comments of The Martian's actor remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to urge people to think, whoever director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said to the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing, "Matt Damon talking over the only dark-skinned person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its release, tweeting collected more than 5000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with the time when an accurate racial performance in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After White Police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album of the Year nominees as a Grammy Award recipient.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of Black Lives Matter recently released a statement to answer Fox News' television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional rock climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and received a $1 million main prize as a reward.
It is precisely in the competition programme that ended its seventh season that there has never been a competitor who has survived all the sections of the barrier course of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last mission was to climb a rope about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to figure out the exhausting 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock for winning the $1 million main prize.
"So it's great to think about it when I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is gonna be like...the future is unknown.
Production manager Kent Weed sat down to discuss the finer with The Hollywood Reporter as well as why Britten does not get more reward money, although he is the first ever rival to have managed to pass the track.
The rules say money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money will be given to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
While money is a great reward and changes life, he nevertheless gets a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He's the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, whose filming starts in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past the Minnesota Twins
MINEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season has not been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
Tigers played their prankster role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
Twins missed the chance to rise half the game from Houston Astros in a competition for another American League wild card seat.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
The Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and yet again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 in 1/3 innings and let three runs go.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeling man to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs that were his first beat runs after mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-shot night after he hit four Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (at batting practice), looked much better at batting practice and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, settled with a single-hive click, and Simon was able to burn straight into second-hive player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to stand against, ahead of the rookie substitute Miguel Sano, who pulled the two nests run left out of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a smoothing runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit a double-game ground strike.
It was a record of the main series: the 27th time this season Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a securing run in the ninth start, Mauer pulled two beat runs against Tigers' closer Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned in three passes in his fifth rescue.
Detroit began by taking advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured before the game after being away for over a month due to lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I made a few nice assists on the third inning."
After Hughes captured the starter striker on the first base, he allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to advance in one place.
The walk of J.D. Martinez on the right side in two fires brought Victor Martinez to batting, who took himself to the first base on the midfield line and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 streak while the runners were in good running positions.
The third base player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and cause another run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second inning and received one fire, two nest situation from runner James McCann and two fires, one nest situation from center Anthony Gose, then the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in pitch readings and pitched a non-running third inning, and was then replaced by a right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs for six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was driven away by a sprain on the shoulder of the throw hand.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, but was to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a real crooked abs strain.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for the wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said when he spoke at the 16th meeting of the group leading to the deepening of general reform.
Support for transparency while pushing reforms forward with more new movement and vitality, and creating a new space for economic growth," Xi said.
The Management Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictions on market access, a relaxation of the principles of border control, a call on state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a review of the system of resident registration.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created identifying the sectors and enterprises in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
This change is notable because it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government also relaxes its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new forms of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private investors, more sectors are opening up.
"The government does not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of companies funded by foreigners and provide them with better services," the opinion said.
In addition, the search process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and lightening the search process.
The meeting also discussed safeguarding the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, reported in a statement published after the meeting.
