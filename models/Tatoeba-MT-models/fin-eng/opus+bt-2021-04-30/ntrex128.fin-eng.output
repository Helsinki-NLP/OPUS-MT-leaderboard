Members of the Wales House are afraid they'll look like fools.
Some members of the assembly are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP, namely the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
Kohu originated from a plan to change the name of the representative body to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House are concerned, regardless of the party position, that change may make them ridiculed.
According to a Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name " rhymes with words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group views name change with "open mind", but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the MWP word to the word meaning fool.
In the Welsh language, the w-letter is pronounced in this context in a similar way to the Yorkshire English u-letter.
The Commission, which is currently drafting a legislative amendment to the name change, stated: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the assembly is, of course, for the members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act of 2017 empowers the representative body to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of the representative body as Parliament in Wales enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured Wales MPs or WMPs as the title of members of the assembly, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the House are apparently proposing alternative titles, but a lack of consensus may cause headaches for President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a bill of amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes includes other changes in the functioning of the representative body, such as rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative debate, members of the assembly may give their final vote on the title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot box in the referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic".
The referendum seeks to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that a change of name is simply the price to be paid for EU-NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martins become quiet as the Harlem churches live in difficult times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say that there used to be a bar or church in every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There's neither of them now."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The interaction of people has changed."
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's common living rooms where people meet regularly".
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"Indistinguishable more people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will speed up the day when these churches close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white parishes before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against merchants on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, following their opposition to hiring or promoting black people.
The fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "the bells of poverty".
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaced historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also remarked that it was the world's first tower clock game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex sledgehammer involving architects and contractors hired by the lay leaders of the church and, on the other hand, by the Episcopal Diocese.
In July, an governing body of lay leaders of the Sakast - the congregation - wrote to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll the costs" to the sacrist, although the sacrist had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency in the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while the boy dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had dived with him about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me that he thought at first that the boy was just excited after catching the lobster, but then he realized that he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to a children's hospital in San Diego, Rady, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the United Kingdom beauty care industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty care wards where expert advisors serve.
This is a major movement for the £2.8 billion beauty care industry in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow despite the decline in the sale of fashion and household goods. Larger beauty care departments are being tried in 11 stores across the country, and when successful they will be extended to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets sought to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's tells us that its range of beauty care products doubles to 3,000 products that include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific area like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique make-up range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly because it is increasingly required by young shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition of grocery shopping to small one-off shopping in local shops forces supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores. The company reports that this contributed to food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how the profits of pharmacies in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows a transaction in which Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business of 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company reported Lloyds as part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty department to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in employees with special training who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand selection responds to all needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "out" after Holly Willoughby withdrew £11 million from the deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "out" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household equipment and accessories for Truly.
The two companies have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand.
A 37-year-old host of this Morning program announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "rare" at a tense meeting last Tuesday held at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their household equipment and accessories label Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand, and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His initial decision has left everyone amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday so close to the release.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
This Morning host is one of Britain's most secure stars, and his departure may, according to experts, cause the company a million-dollar loss due to product placements, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention a delay in publication.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cappi for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Capp for Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as chairman in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baking a new M&S brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity program for ITV.
The source near Jones said the night before, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk, and then we fell in love.
He joked about criticism that would be received in the media for his comments, which some would find inappropriate for the President, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said pretending to be the "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up at all".
He remarked that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had acclaimed the first July meeting as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see "a similar reaction" from the United States to the early disarmament efforts in North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue its sanctions, which were intended to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"You're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship".
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. Missile tests have been discontinued, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more out of this crowded hall, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of us.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
As an example in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although around 10% of Lombok residents had remained homeless.
"In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group travelling to Palau, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains regrettably unprepared to face natural forces, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return likely lost lives due to a missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new area of accident.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's past infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has flowed money to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of either has been plagued by the financial deficit, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Either pressure is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, resulting in the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool sank a late levelling against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the major league on Saturday after painting in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was in goal's losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the back pole.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball dropped over Kepa Arrizabalaga, throwing itself over the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and Shaq-like players always play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, I took one touch and launched without thinking too much".
Chelsea led the match at halftime after 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic no access in the situation, before he rolled away near the midfield and spurted Liverpool to the field half.
Kovacic played a quick wall pass in the midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a great pass.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool Alisson Becker with a left leg shot to the back corner.
Liverpool encounters champions in the league's block stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3 pm at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832 dead
The Indonesian Disaster Bureau reported early Sunday that the earthquake and tsunami casualties rose to 832 victims.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo, reported at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The debris of the collapsed buildings spread widely into the town of Palu, a town of 380 000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The woman's body found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning, initiated a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police will ask people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its initial stages, but I appeal to everyone in the vicinity of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police. They may have vital information for the investigation".
Police female spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman's whereabouts have come to the scene of the crime who have asked about her whereabouts.
As the investigation continues, the police say that they are trying to inform the victim’s loved ones of what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated that "it's terrible."
The area isolated at two in the afternoon had two huts, and outside was also the third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who oversaw the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the symbol 247 on 30 September.
Even the House's Cromwell statue was part of the rewriting of history.
To evict the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatic Puritan supporters destroyed the cultural and religious memorabilia of England as well as the best Taliban.
However, Cromwell club described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said, "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue off Westminster's palace.
Cromwell neither commanded nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer for the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell embodies the views of the 19th century and is a historical proof of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, was caused by monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th century dispute has shaped the later development of our nation. Cromwell, on the other hand, is an identifiable figure representing the other half of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance".
The killer pig mutilated a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media reports a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname "Yuan" was found near a pighouse in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou Province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pigherder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his travelling cousin were reported from nearby Yunna Province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of a nearby pighouse open.
In a pig, he said he saw a big boar with blood on his mouth.
According to the news, forensics confirmed a 250-pound boar mutilated farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News magazine reports a cousin named "Wu" saying that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised".
The security camera photo shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig who killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm other police gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reported to negotiate compensation for death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 pounds wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
An Oregonian farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that although pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can serve as a "launcher".
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
All you have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring extensive heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as she moves over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the United States southwest.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. a first-class hurricane, on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. on the east coast of time, and was located 620 km. southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa brings up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rainy areas southwest of the next few days.
Locally, rainfalls of 25 to 100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation of 50-75 mm per hour in certain fallout areas, especially Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas in the southwest, and especially Arizona, rain is expected up to 50 to 100 millimetres.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can rapidly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms create local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the area.
Fragile tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, intense fluctuations can be seen throughout at temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
A fine example of large temperature differences is seen in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines.
The lingering heat of the summer seeks to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures approaching +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can be increased to +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees above average.
Our long - term forecast is that the eastern United States has a good chance of higher temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched a broadcast transmitted by six television channels on Tuesday, where the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of a sexual offence in the 1980s, gave her fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies interrupted their broadcast at a last-minute turn, according to which the FBI conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations based on a contract arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that the intoxicated Kavanaugh groped him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
There were likely more viewers than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Other channels that sent the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure viewers who watch in offices.
Something about proportions tells us that the figure corresponds to the number of viewers of the American football playoff or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was Fox News Channel, which has been strongly supported by opinion leaders in Kavanaugh's appointment. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during a hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the center of Friday's drama was Flake.
The CNN and CBS cameras filmed how the protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday.
CNN showed live how he stood for minutes looking down as the reproaches flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he'll tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told".
Flake said that his office issued a statement and added that before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to tell after a committee hearing.
Hours later, cable and broadcasting networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to take Kavanaugh's appointment to the vote in the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that he would only operate in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations made against the candidate in the coming week, as demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the discussions he had with his friend, the democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flage's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit politics
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses people criticizing his EU divorce plans for a policy that threatens Britain's future and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was released on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls the proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's import duties, "absolutely absurd".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person suspected of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball in LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison and, according to Baton Rouge Police Department, is charged with second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's showdown, in which police report Sims losing his glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, says WAFB.
Police report Simpson's admitting to the shooting of Waydy during interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his bail amount was set at US$350,000.
On Friday, the coroner of East Baton Rouge Municipality published a preliminary report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency commends the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement authorities for their "industriousness and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A six-foot-long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 discballs in the match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "frightened" and "shocked" by the death of Wayd.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the Mexican disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater activity accelerated and within 24 hours had registered 183 gas and ash discharges.
The center registers rum and vibrations several times.
In social media, photos were released in which car windscreens in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City were covered by a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 kilometres southwest of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 magnitude in Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paratists will clash before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a confrontation between supporters of independence and riot police, who took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the resignation vote that had given opinions.
Police held the group of disguised supporters of independence, who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, forming dark dust clouds normally on the streets filled by tourists.
Over the day, more skirmishes broke out as police officers used their batons to control the dummies.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
The tension is still in the zone of independence one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but which is celebrated by Catalan paratists.
Voters elected independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when opponents boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
The independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, an 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives".
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory achieved in last December's regional elections, the momentum of parties supporting Catalan independence has waned this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who depicted a police-friendly demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides sparked controversy.
"It's getting tighter and tighter," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in detention since last year, announced that he would be attending next year's European Parliament elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after the car crashed into the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
Events progressed at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.

Livingston won the Rangers with a 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
Serialist Livingston amazed Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win with Gary Holt's team rising to a split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the first guest win of the season in Premiership. Next Sunday, it will meet serial leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
Rangers still meet in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his loss-free streak in the show to a length of six games. Head coach Holt has not yet lost once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats to a visitor who was suffering from a lack of blade.
Holt's team should have led long before their goal after causing the Rangers serious difficulties with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next thing I know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide from the front of the goal to Craig Halkett's bulldozer, but he steered past the ball.
Hosts popularly handed over ball management to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
This is exactly how the important goal came.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga a place from which he was able to move the ball into the middle of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team's defenses to hold, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly tried.
The same pattern continued during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to be combated.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow steered the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
In addition, two of the situations required a unnecessary penalty kick - after Halkett tackles a switchman Glenn Middleton and a hand-hit ball.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotlann at Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to every player, continuing through the uplifts.
The team's playing habits and crew have not changed much since it got back to the highest tier.However, Holt must be credited for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was spectacular in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Wormall on his toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas, though.
The team has occasionally performed very well under Gerrard, but was now far removed from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the home team's defense only once. This should serve as a wake-up call to the Rangers, which is the center caste of the series table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is intended to restore relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and press freedom as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 heads from gathering in front of the mosque, arguing for security reasons, but still a lot of supporters gathered around to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the Turks in Germany greet him as a hero, while others slander him as an autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: A biker dies in a collision with a car
A biker died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:00 a.m. local time in the southwest of Deptford near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with lively traffic.
The car driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident site.
The city police report that they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted, and drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards have been injured by men's high security clearance in the prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday British time and continue.
The Tornado Special Police have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison care spokesperson said, "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to the HMP Long Lartin prison to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars".
The HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, riot police were alerted to prison in October due to serious unrest, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (drift areas can benefit)
Rarely tropical low pressures arrive in Arizona, but that is what is happening at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remains move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rainfalls.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to Southern and Eastern Nevada, southeast Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rains.
Phoenix's National Weather Service pointed out in its tweet that only "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 kilometres from the Arizona border".
The latest modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts rains of 50 to 100 millimetres. On the Mogoll ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimetres in places.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres are veritable. In the places, it can rain up to 100 millimetres.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in the drought affected area if there is no danger of heavy rain floods.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be useful because of the severe drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, reports Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes an invasion of the California Peninsula in Mexico on her route.
On Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, which is still strong with hurricane wind speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts, Mexico rains can be severe and pose a considerable flood risk.
"From the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is expected 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible," says Weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border in a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning hours. From there she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday late.
"The main risks of Rosa's or its remains are likely to be associated with very severe rains on the California Peninsula, in northwestern Sonora, and in the United States southwest desert," reports the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in a "steady" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
Police ask for contact from anyone who may have video footage of events stored on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh experienced the "evilness and anger" of the Democratic Party
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeler, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the "decentness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charge of sexual harassment that would have taken place decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also testified about his accusation in the hearing.
The president said Saturday "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"My vote in favour of strengthening Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a voice for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent seams of public service," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in intermediate elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the full," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that Democrats assumed the task of "opposing and blocking".
The senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination procedure is expected for the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the number of casualties expected to rise
On Saturday, officials reported at least 384 deaths after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped with giant waves hitting the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six metres high struck the beach at dusk. Many washed up to their death as the waves destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunam was caused by earthquakes of 7.5 magnitude.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach, and they did not immediately escape, leaving them as victims of it," says Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, but pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and hit everywhere on the ground," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 km/h on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the Disaster Bureau show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a water-stricken mosque.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped in the Second World War of Hiroshima.
It says that the terrain of a long and narrow town at the end of the bay could swell the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and the damage may be greater on the Plus 300 km north of the continuous coast, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communications "are completely cut off, and no information has been received about Donggala" says Nugroho.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, over 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were en route to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling us that the tsunami hit the Palau, although the authorities said that the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, the man on the upper floors of the building is fervently shouting warnings about the approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall strikes the beach, which takes buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify even the authenticity of the image material.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Authorities report that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities on transportation machines, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief operations, and remains closed until October.
President Either Widodo was to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami's casualties exceed 800.
It's really bad.
The Donggala staff of World Vision have reached safety in the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tent cloth roofs in the courtyard of the office. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As relief teams began their uncomfortable mission, some complained that foreign relief workers were prevented from travelling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made".
When the second night descended upon Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members in the missing were hoping that their loved ones by miracle would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, a coach for the Indonesian hang glider team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, says Mandag.
"As an older member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says that he was desperately trying to reach the competitors of Palu who participated in the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse spread among the hang union community.
However, only one gray sign appeared after the messages he sent, instead of two blues.
"It means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 in addition to the ATM in Newport on the Wide
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security company employee while he was completing an ATM in Newport on the Leve, reported in a bulletin from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying and completing the ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy says in the press release.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "he was behind him ran by his men" who stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the bulletin, eyewitnesses saw several persons fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information on their identities are asked to contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "a character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who, according to the show's creator, withdrew her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has a religious meaning for him, not only that it is an acronym of his professional name.
While discussing the album's name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you."
"So I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye, which merely embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly a reflection on who we are".
He's one of several known rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for varying degrees as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he favored the names Love and Brother Love.
West's previous partner JAY-Z has also sometimes deleted and restored the connecting line and large letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Ozor, elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "never would use an army to oppress the Mexican people".
Armed forces fired at a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student support and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of AI research
The United States should double the funding it spends on AI research as China improves its industry. This is what Google, Microsoft, and Apple have been told by the financier and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee.
The opinion was preceded by communications on AI in various parts of the US administration, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Double funding could double the probability that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee reported in this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the U.S.'s highest ranked Othello player. Later, he served as director of Microsoft Research and director of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says American researchers worked hard to get public support.
"Academic influences are not exported by China, but by large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university tops in recent years to work on AI.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
"I think AI graduates should be automatically granted green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organizations grant money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defence established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic partners in the world. The White House has also announced the formation of an AI special committee.
DARPA was also announced this month for a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, in turn, invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill for the establishment of the National Security Commission for AI has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum on changing the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonia Republic", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries agreed on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote casts doubt as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% threshold in order to make the result legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the price should be paid in order to allow Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 per cent of those entitled to vote finally cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership .
A 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents erected by boycotters in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads upright, not through the kitchen door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, such as China and Russia, as part of the integration of the euro area".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership brings needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe a large majority will vote in favour of a name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" voice was our "requesting future."
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to a turnout of between 30% and 43% in the referendum - below the required level of activity.
In another poll conducted by Telma TV, Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote in favour of the yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the West-minded government after it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat Brighton's defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the figure, the Argentine top player received a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space in the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then found Sterling by supplying the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot into the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Lucky for us, he scored in that time".
However, Sterling had already given the sky blue an advantage in the major league struggle.
The goal came in 29 game minutes.
Aguero received a ball in the deep Brighton area in the situation.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few contacts before sending the ball to the rear pole towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker poked the ball into the net just before the end line.

Scherzer wants to be a party pooper in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why forcefully pursue the starting lineup?
Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to take over the pitching mound in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have a one-win difference for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Series.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still aim for their first division win.
"Although we don't have a bet, we can at least get up to the pitch hill, knowing that the crowd and the other team's lounge atmosphere here in Denver will create the most demanding competitive setting for me that I have encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to accept the challenge?"
Nationals have not yet released their starter on Sunday, but according to information, they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a rehearsal on Thursday, playing his 34th game at the start and pitching on Sunday on his normal rest period.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the batter to the nest 300 times, with the inning statistics 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning to the full, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening at the moment.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain about who they hurt or who they have to roll so they can gain power. That's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats took on the task of "opposed and deterring".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hate and mean and malicious and false".
As he referred to Dianne Feinstein as the longest-acting democratic Senator in the Senate Committee of Justice, the audience responded with loud boos.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I expect a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not actually surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the last Labour representative in the line to be told that I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, of which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East Labour Conference stated on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been just that.
Now, many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is suitable for party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I would never have agreed to otherwise, whether it be national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is an avalanche of insults in the social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, for downtown politics to be abandoned and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are, at least, political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face daily sexual and racist abuse and will never waver.
The normalisation of mistreatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of politics of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn insisted that Labour should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party adopting different opinions, and with each motion of censure or change in the selection rules, the party becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything would go well."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the neglect of the Thatcher government's single school, I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as a city councillor and as a minister.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated in Ayr block tip
The two final-minute goals slightly distorted the match's outcome, but Ayr unquestionably earned a win of the day in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of 10 that hasn't lost a single match.
Great defense and more successful risk taking was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our games and we're still undefeated, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayri, they took risks better than us."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climate's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who surrendered to the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which, in a conversion kick, Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out from the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which, in a conversion-kick, Climo succeeded.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal after heavy pressure, the conversion-kicking of which was unsuccessful.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle by a ballless Clyde, and Macpherson scored a goal from the back of Ayr's maul, who left the sideline throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's kick and brushed Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
The star of the Still Game series begins in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been named Director of the licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
A 56-year-old actor performs Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is registered as director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": inland Bolivia tries to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean by legal means
Seamen patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
There is a sea blue flag flying in the flagpoles of public buildings.
Navy bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smeared with a slogan: "Justly the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to get it back."
In the interior of Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline of the bloody 19th century resource war in Chile is still strong – as is the longing to sail the Pacific once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, co-spirit and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians throughout the country are following with hope the International Court's ruling from the big screens, hoping that The Hague will support – after decades of intermittent debate – Bolivia's position that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The charismatic president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who confronts the controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot to do with next Monday's alignment.
"A return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he asserted in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The United Nations institution of Dutch origin has no competence to extradite Chilean administrative territories, and the ICJ has indicated that it will not impose the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is given just six months after the last statements suggest that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than contributed to Bolivia’s ends.
"The current Bolivian regime has captured the question of sea connection," said Zárate.
Morales' controversy-challenged rhetoric has suppressed the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivia's representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia the "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never surrender his right to connect to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it's time for us to move on from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament would not happen unless it could trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's statement came just before US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is restarting deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said that it is a "faraway dream" to believe that the extended sanctions and US opposition to the Korean declaration of the end of the war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon an arsenal that the state probably sees as the only real way to guarantee its own safety has been subject to widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris fashion shows present the latest collection of large-sized headgear, which will soon also be on your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 collection show a selection of special oversized headgear dazzled by the style districts of Paris' fashion weeks.
Very impractical headgear took Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was the beige hat with wide feather lire, which covered the designs' heads almost entirely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — just in time before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more like a diving device, and another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing on the street.
The oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter cylinder, seen in all of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
In social media, the cultimen of a well-seen impractical hat also engulfed another large creation into fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model carrying it.
The burnt orange reed-lined raffia bag with white leather armbands was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection in Paris fashion weeks.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the street picture next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for world citizens
The learning results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and communal success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council SCIS, aim to provide a high level of service for their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education, and world citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement tailored study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest test results of this year, we find that languages are at the top of the lists for the percentage of admissions between private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 schools belonging to the SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that 72% of students who received the best grade A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French, and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
Based on a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17% of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for promoting young people's careers in the future.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more relevant these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically ahead of a multilingual person in the competition.
According to a 2013 poll conducted by YouGov, over 4,000 iso-British adults are unable to hold a debate in a foreign language, and French was the only language that could be spoken by a two-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are supposedly important to the people of Great Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options in private schools taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed for success, whatever the future holds.
In this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education and training.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, versatility and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Head of the SCIS Council of Scottish Private Schools
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of supporters waiting for LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers ranks is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the season starts playing.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six matches to be played before Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump West Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaigns today in Wheeler, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the free seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump aims to increase support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 7 pm at the time of the East Coast on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is likely to take a stand on this week's hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became ardent on charges of sexual harassment, who have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote as long as a week while the FBI investigates the charges filed.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in a tight November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on by these five events of the following week the purpose of this is to "wake up volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Management of Congress is so essential to his purpose that the President is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season," Trump's campaign's anonymous representative told Reuters.
Today's venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeler, and supporters can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to the current month in West Virginia, a state where he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
"From the point of view of Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support in polls," states political scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows a will to fight to maintain hope before Sunday single games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-confirming power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and increasingly in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this power of success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this success power as a drop," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and much to be encouraged by, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior from brick to green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory party intensified as his round progressed as he succeeded in a critical putt to equalize the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt with which they won the 15th game was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You need to concentrate really well and just take care of your own fight," Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undeniable legends of the Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only two to make no Bog on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this boisterous audience confirms that they are the favorites of Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to ensure Europe’s possible victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time with different holes.
However, the speeches about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated the paired Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of the morning's four-player.
One Bog and two double bobs on the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swede so deep in the pit that they were not even close to surviving there.
On Sunday, though, no one's coming to help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursomes are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of partner cooperation: What kind of advice they give or fail to give, and how strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a prominent lead before the last day, but this four-player showed that the US team has a will to fight, although it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took a 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning procession from the two winning Tiger Woods, and scored a high score of four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who struggled hard to preserve the victory he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weakly played US team in the morning four-ball, taking the match to situation 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points for Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend in Ryder Cup history, were the second two to have won four points in the first four games.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball, they then finished the superiorly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two matches, was occasionally very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and four games, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned with Henry Stenson to the quadruple, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the southwest.
Three-time prize winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They acquired a tough 2-1 victory over the Spanish Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in a four-ball, and later a 4-3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-player after losing the first two holes however.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from a four-point chase station to levels as the doubles begin, although a draw on Furyk's side is also enough to retain the victory.
True, after two days of being the second best, it may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea "not under any circumstances" disarms itself without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "substantial benevolent measures" over the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a test site for nuclear tests and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so under such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri repeated the familiar lamentation that Washington does not accept the phasing out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for each intermediate subject, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarming was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US sitting president and North Korea leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in a statement, Kim asserted "the removal of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has tried formally to end the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed facilitating the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"U.S. calls for "the removal of nuclear weapons first", and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals by force – even resisting "the declaration of peace"," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump Summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added, "If the disarming party were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Rin was significantly different from last year when he reported at the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental areas of the United States was inevitable after the "evil president" Trump called Kim a "missile" with suicidal intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to " completely destroy" North Korea. However, this year Trump lauded Kim's courage to approach the surrender of weapons, yet stressed that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea gives up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no temporal deadline: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue forcefully and without failure until we prove a full, final and strengthened nuclear disarmament waiver."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of stopping the funding channels for the production of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with North Korea Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly, and he also announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the Second Summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
On leaving Pyongyang, he described progress made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsteric demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event of the United States taking "similar measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "like measures" security guarantees to which Trump committed at Singapore's meeting, and moving towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate course of rest instruction
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will take a course this year to increase the student's rest. The course is a counterattack to the university's thriving macho culture, where students weigh a long night with caffeine power.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of basic matters related to their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler of Harvard University Medical Faculty, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after lecturing about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he told in an interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course will guide students about how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performances and improve overall well-being.
Professor of Harvard University Medical Faculty and Deputy Director of University Health Services Paul Barreira says that the university ended the course after hearing how students suffered serious sleep deprivations during the study week.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information on the effects of caffeine and light and the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate effect on students' behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these things in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
All night long study marathons are, according to Professor Czeisler, still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made the sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Geting adequate and high quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' against stress, fatigue, and anxiety among students, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a space similar to starvation in the brain, which makes man constantly hungry," the professor notes.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler to plan the course after he had attended one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He reports that the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus to organize a course covering all campus students.
He hopes that all graduate students could complete a similar study package before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting an alarm clock for students to also remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning and urges them to bear in mind the effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the "blue light" cycle, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot beat Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1–0 win.
Ibrox players were picking up their first win since February 4–1 game, which took place against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now only experienced his second loss during his 18-game manager's career. Rangers missed eight points from the current leader of the major league Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' falling battle pace was then no longer smoothed the situation.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and in goal difference is only Hibernia.
Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game as an object thrown from the guest stand hits the head, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the lineup with which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 lineup that the team took away a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy once again produced results when a well-built lineup managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score a goal at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free path to Allan McGregor's goal. Pittman, however, failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to launch wide into the back pole.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the final third of the game there was no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos claimed punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly rejected the lassana Coulibaly bush and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
Rangers could still do nothing to Jacobs' long pitch tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched Scott Robinson, who coldheadedly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the exchange period, Gerrard decided to trade Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly's impressive fast defense.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game. However, McGregor's fine defense blocked Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow reached his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the exchange of Rangers, also demanded a penalty kick after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
Next, page "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray scientists who seem to be quite cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter, used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention that carries his name, however, still lives.
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment
Cells resistant to the method are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ proteins typical of several cancers
The vaccine has given promising results in different cancer patients.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, the United States, describes the method: "Our results suggest it is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancer of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West got boos on the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after lauding President Donald Trump and announcing that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the evening "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"Frequently when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The evening broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Justice Committee, which relates to allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment committed by Kavanaugh.
West's ranting was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a fragment of it into social media.
It is unclear whether Rock's intention is to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated by a hat he wore in his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go onstage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm in the margin," West says in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what being in the margin means?" and says he's wearing the Superman cape because "then you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variety, West's comments made boos from the audience at least twice, and the performers of the show looked embarrassed. One of the present described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected for the program on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: "Thank you for THE CONFESSIONAL".
However, the leader of the conversation program Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is only herself, which is absolutely wonderful."
"I can, however, decide to be STUDY of a person (by buying his music or clothing mark or by supporting his "art"), which I believe supports and spreads an ideology harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same applies to us," he added.
Rappäri announced before his performance on Twitter that he changed his name to "person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and subsequently an artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Belfast's restaurant stabbing is charged with attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The actor of the throne game, Kit Harington, attacks poisonous masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series The throne game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero's stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural annex, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong", and questions the means in place to tackle toxic masculinism in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who recently married Rose Leslie, a member of the Star Guard of the throne game, also admits that she has a strong desire to intervene in the subject.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is currently evoking strong feelings in me," he says.
"What have men been taught about their growth in years that has led to problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain types of men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
Because there's something really wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the ancestors or sequels of the throne game after the show ends next summer because, according to his own words, he "has had enough of battlefields and horses".
In November Harrington is seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose wife was the best that the throne game has offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love played by Harrington in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, one year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections via sex are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70–90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are due to insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the employee leaked Republican information and accuses the spreading of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
A member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied Saturday claims that her employee would have published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website about them.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles asserted that claims are spread by "right-wing" commentators and websites.
"L lies, lies, and more contemptible lies," says Waters in his statement on Twitter.
Among the published data, it is reported that there were home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the state of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person released the information from the United States Congress during a hearing with the Senate Committee, concerning allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that according to Hillin newspaper, messages were released from an IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolute lies."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be indignant.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
The situation should be conducted with moderation and calmness."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the Thursday hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' seat in Congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters announced that he had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," he continued, "and that they are brought to legal responsibility for any destructive and dangerous action against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – an underpowered Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already established tradition to look for Brexit references anywhere in a film that is expensive to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit Johnny English's agent parody and action comedy series, which originated in 2003 on the Johnny English track and revived in the 2011 sequel "Johnny English – Reborn".
Can a language from a nation's satir on the cheek become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the face-eyed, rubber-faced, and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His name tells us first of all that it is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
Of course, it's about that idiot secret agent who desperately seeks to spirit a melting glamour around him, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unhappy one-note musician at the 2012 London opening concert.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious worldman who was portrayed by Atkinson in the originally forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The most recent performance has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and rotor blades bruise his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy come out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because 'serious' film brands such as 007 and the Dangerous Task now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English's crazy-headed replay does not seem as resourceful and sharp-sighted to me as the comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Bean's silent role.
The starting point that is repeated every year is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents in the field to the dismay of a working agent – which is portrayed as an unfortunately small performance of Kevin Eldon's role.
This is the last drop for the prime minister in the ploy and pinnacle who is already in the swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson does everything in the skin of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just does not provide him with enough space.
As intelligence advisors inform him that all spies in the field have been revealed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be called to the emergency.
Of course, it's Johnny English, who is screwing up in his own person. He spends his retirement as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble skill of espionage. The subject opens up some clever jokes; English holds school of Rock-type lessons to the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets his endless patient partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to gain her rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of His Majesty to confront Ophelia Bhuletova, a fatal super criminal played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is becoming manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately turns into a farce: the two disguised as waiters ignites a fine French restaurant and causes chaos while secretly pursuing Volta's luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta's house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the perpetrators will fade at the end of the scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit made for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I have come to the same conclusion: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with five days' pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to require corporate leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would be ‘suited’ to the party's economic program and its plans to tilt policy for the benefit of workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source tells the Sunday Times newspaper: "The review of the line was announced before the change of year.
The change does not happen in a moment, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party undertook to support the transition to a four-day working week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective does not receive undivided support for Labour.
The Labour Party spokesman states: "The four-day working week is not the party's line, nor is the party considering such a move."
John McDonnell, finance minister of the shadow government, used last week's work conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and " speculators" of corporations of general interest.
According to the plans of the Finance Minister of the Shadow Government, current water companies' shareholders would not be able to recover their share as a whole, as the Labour-led government could execute "reductions" on the basis of the irregularities detected.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to create an inclusive ownership fund that would transfer 10% of private sector companies' share capital to employee management.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in the 60-minute program whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
An investigation into allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week of final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In a 60-minute show broadcast on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to discover things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more transparent than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing... I said I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up, and I asked him ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut in stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one of the people he named was able to confirm the matter.
It's a 36-year-old matter.
I can't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival, held in New York City, is a music event with a performer guard as impressive as its mission: the eradication of poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the Central Park in New York City to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the actual goal of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the eradication of poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "dos", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-maker or make a call, or perform any other action that spreads awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that we have only 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘cliktivism’ among others — the notion that you can change the world by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million "dos" for different goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to announce commitments and principles that account for over $37 billion and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have already been affected by the funds achieved.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to "helping children develop their full potential". The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after activists had sent them 4,700 TVs as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and just like you, world citizens, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition history to newspapers," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said to the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also urged to take steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with over 5,000 actions.The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the frequently asked questions column on the store's website is, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's answer: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks lie ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the movement against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman host the movement's New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" resort to the help of its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's activities in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse for the exploration of the new energy market in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia's] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke reportedly said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"U.S. has the ability to keep shipping routes open with the help of its fleet and, if necessary, surround them to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Union, a non-profit group profiled as a "energy consumers' mouthpiece" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions date to a situation in which the Trump administration has sought to step up the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuited" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to the Moscow leash.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of 110 billion cubic metres of the current pipeline, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is motivated by purely economic reasons, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier" says Minister of Energy of Russia Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Confederation of Industry, recently after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to carefully consider" running for presidential election in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced on Saturday that she would "think carefully" to stand as a presidential candidate after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed that he would consider a nomination at an open questionnaire in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty administration, and this also means women at the head of the kingdom" he said, according to The Hill magazine.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think carefully about becoming a presidential candidate".
Warren judged President Donald Trump during the occasion by saying that "he is taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he released on Friday, Warren wrote "well, I guess we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to an opinion poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's constituents do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to the Institute for Political Research at Suffolk University and a study by Boston Globe, 58% of "probably" voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of the senator running for office.
32% was in favour of standing as a candidate.
Of the polls, more supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates raised in the discussions for the 2020 election include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said that he will formally end his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war traumas at Donald Trump's election event
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on the night of Monday and charged with domestic violence
"What my own son has to go through when he returns home I can well identify with other families who have to face the consequences and injuries of PTSD, which our returning soldiers carry," he told the audience gathered at the election ceremony in Tulsa, Oklahoma for Donald Trump.
Palin called the arrest a ‘flood horse in the living room’ and said his son, like other war veterans, "returning home a little changed, they return hardened, they come back wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and the Air Force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman and domestic violence and handling the gun intoxicated.
18 states and Columbia Federal District support the new asylum policy action
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federal District are seeking a change to the new policy that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federations have submitted a court friend letter on Friday in Washington, D.C. The letter supports asylum seekers who violate the policy is reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit, which American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal alignment.
He tells his partner "and his sons from the violent gang" assaulted him. US officials denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom are from the United States asylum seekers, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the decision of the Board of Appeal for asylum applications in 2014 that undocumented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
The District Attorney Karl Racine of Columbia commented in his statement on Friday that the new line "dismisses states, federal and international law over decades".
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be settled on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle" - the letter of friends of the court says.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum seekers are prevented from accessing practice is damaging the US economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring the necessary additional labour".
In June, Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum from victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Security is intended for persons fleeing their home country due to persecution or fear caused by belonging to a race, religion, nationality or a certain social class or political opinion" Sessions announced a new asylum practice in their 11 June opinion.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survivors’ rescue efforts continue in Palu — the number of casualties found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is becoming even more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her feverish baby in an evacuation centre in Palu's devastated city.
"Ambulances bring minute by minute new bodies.
We're running low on clean water."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods, and try to save what is yet to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude quakes are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, powerful postshocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he repeats how a ferocious earthquake shook the fifth floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris tells me according to the Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in town.
"I heard my wife scream for help and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "provoking" with "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American magazine as a propaganda tool. This occurs a week after the Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the U.S.-China Trade Agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid annex to China Daily in the Des Moines Register newspaper, which is the largest newspaper in Iowa State, after accusing China of interfering in the 6 November Congressional elections. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of attempts to interfere in the elections in the United States, according to the US officials who spoke to Reuters, mark a new stage in the Washington expanding campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for a foreign government to distribute advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a constantly escalating trade war in which both sides impose customs duties on the opposing party's export products in turn.
According to Chinese and American experts, Chinese revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa State says Beijing did damage to the working population, farmers and businesses of the United States. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press" wrote Branstad Sunday in a poll published in Des Moines Register.
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the prestigious U.S. free word and press traditions by placing paid notice in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, there are only limited differences of opinion in the Beijing Street newsstands, and real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers evaded the offer to publish" an article he wrote, but does not specify what magazine it is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh can cause, according to analysts, a counter-reaction, especially among female voters, in the upcoming interim election.
Emotions surrounding the incident have been on big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be canceled," says political professor Grant Reeher of Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation appeases angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to Friday's newspaper in the capital.
Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming" as they voiced in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to advance Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, an unattached political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18–29, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the candidate of the Supreme Court, where he made his claim to sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Speaker of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just a matter of the committee's vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned; it is a question of how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the Democrat-supporting Priorities USA group, pointed out to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony as a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushes the matter forward, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified affidavitly before the judicial committee that Kavanaugh harassed him while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for a Supreme Court member revealed to him his genitalia at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet as a counterattack for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data are stored and who has access to what information.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's intention to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup attempt.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, notebooks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on a single browser simultaneously.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide the resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid into the reach of all.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt's website. All of this is available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change where all their business models are turned over overnight".
"We will not ask their consent to the matter."
In an article published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute also after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross Medal of the Church of England, who served as a soldier, after 100 years of events.
The Medal of Braveness was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 due to the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died a sniper was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest British Army honor he had received.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "acting symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to London Gazette, 29 September 1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine guns fire."
Later, he plunged into the front line and "showing the greatest valor" led the troop advance before assaulting the field gun alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann took down three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lt. Colonel Vann died a German sniper was created on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve like, something that inspires respect."
Michael Vann He counted his brother Dr James Vann with the wreath after a parade edited by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added, "a great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the free game were waiting up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the television channel showed Pipsa Pissua
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
The event in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live in Britain on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to Pipsa Pissou to the great dismay of viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy to stay up all night because of the match.
One friend of the free match opened up on Twitter describing the game as replacing the game with a children's cartoon as a "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was not appropriate for presentation at 6 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children's program" explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Deputy Director of Marketing and Communication at Bellator for the change of program".
"Pipsa Pig, yes".
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a rebroadcast that'll probably get the program working," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning there, and we can't get the show performed before Sunday on our time, which in turn is Monday on their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to move in one direction and the other, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and tried too hard.
This is a troubled situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. However, this motivates him to success.
A 24-year-old athlete says he didn't notice until he came to high school that "everyone is not like me."
Daley, who spoke on the Radio 4 channel Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, says that he talked about gay rights to give ‘hope' to others.
He also tells how, after having a child at the Olympics, winning was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a permanent host of a long-term radio program, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley reported that he felt more ‘lower’ than everyone else when he was young, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work".
He says, "To this day, these feelings, feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show that he was ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and appears at this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The triple world champion tells his fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "coming as a surprise".
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you're young" — he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find someone of that age who would have experienced similar benefits and hardships," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – resulting in Daley's "whole perspective" having changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest questions he asked Daley about the entrance tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games. He wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he won't be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped. It was only after his breath had really stopped and he was dead that I finally understood that he was not invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of my whole life – to jump in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration to his first song choice on the air – Heather Small's song "Proud" – which aroused feelings already as he prepared for the Olympics, and which still makes her skin goose meat.
Desert Island Discs are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half fit Mickelson bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he needs to make a significant improvement to avoid the record round being left in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays in an event played every two years for the record 12th time went on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome to be played on Saturday.
In general, the five-time Major tournament winner, who is the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half in the field trying to gain control of his batting.
48-year-old Mickelson, not even considered at the top of his career as one of the most accurate riders, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-grown roughy punishes for unintentional beatings.
If there is not enough resistance in the field itself for Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth game against the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, known for his accuracy, who plays along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to have a streak of all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind by 12 doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game may prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, grappled and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came up with.
He wants to be in that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, although never comparable to his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke at people's expense and he's a funny guy everyone likes to hang out with," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week too. It's funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his mere contribution to the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the large lead of the Ryder Cup before the two games of the last day can become a bumpy journey.
A Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who emerged as a winner with lime lines just and just by the measure of his nose and won with the narrowest margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds itself how we ran briskly in Valderrama, we ran briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but won in Valderrama, though sparsely," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5–3 wins both on Friday and yesterday, moving into a 10–6 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going out to the airport and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that is all we are aiming for.
As I have always said, I focus on these 12 players who are playing on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at how his team's players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I drop in on such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow's priority is individual performances, and that's when we talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything goes well, but when you are alone in the field, then the player’s capacity is tested down to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be transmitted to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up the partner who gets to go [to the airport alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk comes to demand better performance from his players as individuals than they were able to as partners. Except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the final day turns in both directions. He was part of the team that won in Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won with a "Medinah miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question about how captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out his team's ranks to the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our lineup accordingly and put the boys on the field as we want, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence battle and he encounters Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to face their European counterparts.
"I put the group's guys in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament through," Bjorn commented on their doubles choices.
A New German Warship Delays Again
The latest frigate in the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the ship is to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, according to local media.
According to a military spokesperson for Die Zeit, the introduction of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin', the new first ship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are scheduled to replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with an effective cannon, missile systems to control aircraft and surface vessels, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal detection.
The important features of the ship also include its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
However, constant delays mean that technology-driven warships – the purpose of which is said to be to improve German influence in the overseas territories – are already obsolete at the time of their entry into service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate ended up in headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to introduce the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet will return the ship after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in German media of essential "software and hardware failures" that make a warship unfit for combat duties.
The software deficiencies are particularly central to the fact that the crew of Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's chances of subsequent updates.
It is believed that Rheinland-Pfalz, of its capacity of 7,000 tonnes, is twice as heavy as the equivalent class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the whole price tag of the project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning sum of EUR 3.1 billion, compared with EUR 2.2 billion in the original price.
The problems of introducing new frigates have been raised as the German maritime power has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, director of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable ships "are running low".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time due to the decommissioning of old vessels, but no new ones have been submitted.
He lamented that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigate could have been introduced by the Navy.
The environmental organization is listening to the hidden lives of bats
A new study in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
New research is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future conservation measures.
Research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is being monitored for bats of pests and dwarfs, as well as ear bugs and water wings in the area of Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed in important areas of the area to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
Workers and volunteers of the organisation also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the votes, as well as the species concerned, shall be ensured by the analysis of the experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report will be created in which bat behaviour can be presented in a scale image of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's nature conservation advisor hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats, and how different species exploit them.
This information helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking bats and related species into account.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have decreased considerably over the last 100 years.
Construction and civil engineering are threatening bats' resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and certain chemicals used in construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of night hunting practices, their ears are more beneficial in catching catch than in the eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
National Trust for Scotland is an organization focused on protecting the rural environment that maintains over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 hectares of areas across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, ramp inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue activities.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only reserve for the protection of bats on the lands of the Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area. Eight of the ten bat species in Scotland are found in the area.
According to farm manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave suits bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment overall.
The bats are not yet known everything, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He emphasizes the importance of checking the buildings for bats before embarking on refurbishment, as the destruction of one of the bats' resting places may inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is forbidden.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "election news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to publish claims to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for secrecy, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram livecast for 142 million followers only hours after making claims. A 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as "election news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player went on to smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare Der Spiegel's sue over allegations they have called "unworthy reporting of privacy concerns" according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player demands compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the offense, which probably means the most serious personal rights violation in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met at a nightclub and moved to the player's room where he allegedly raped him anally, according to papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said he was "99% good guy", but whose "one percent" disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later ended up in a compromise because she was "in horror of the possibility of revenge" and worried about being "affected by public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking annulment of the reconciliation procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to a contract to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret forever" the end of car manufacturing
UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered the announcement by the UK unit of Toyota to temporarily suspend production in his factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit is ended up without an agreement.
A factory in Burnaston – manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain breaks out of the EU abruptly at the end of March, there will be interruptions to our factory production," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exit from the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini-manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit comes into being.
The main concern is, according to car manufacturers, the risks related to the supply chain as non-contractual Brexit materialises.
The Toyota production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars are manufactured on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disturbance at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and parts of the problem.
Keeping a warehouse for more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire factory is impossible according to Toyota, and production would be discontinued.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "acquired to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers' statements show that we definitely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chains to date."
Toyota cannot tell how long the production will be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and serves as a union trustee at the factory, says among the growing members of concern: "The jobs lost according to my experience will never return.
A government spokesperson says, "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Meeting Trump with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "be moved again in a week" due to a fuss around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's involvement in the election, Trump's assistants' contacts with Russia, and any action taken by the President to prevent justice.
There have been rumours in Washington for months that Trump intends to dismiss the Assistant Attorney General, which would compromise the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of sacking the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment of the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reportedly to have been Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, at the time, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York, so the day of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he "not preferably" would fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with a hearing with the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate plenary session.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
But I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Chris Wallace, a news anchor, asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than an aversion to the "observance" of TV journalists, but nonetheless stated: "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"President holds more Question Hours than any president before him," he says, and adds further evidence without quoting: "We have checked those numbers."
"Press events will still be organised," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this when performing uninhibitedly and strangely at times to journalists assembled.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries about fears about Brexit in the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland).
The Minister of Health has written a letter to workers from EU countries from the Scottish health care system to express their gratitude and hope for staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applying for the "established status" of EU citizens working in the field of specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, the separation negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for a possible non-contractual separation.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers team supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost 31–27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on the stretcher and taking him to the side for further evaluation.
The Tennessee State trustee told WSMV channel reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no record of the type/wideness of the injury at this stage", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first season in the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK. The extra money will be spent on helping the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year – helping the homeless
Theresa May will be announcing today a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of more affordable housing and paid attention to the taxation of well-earned people.
The raising of the stamp tax will be directed at people and companies who do not pay taxes to Great Britain, and this extra money will be directed to government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee – added to the current stamp tax in addition to the two-year-old increases in second-occupied dwellings and investment dwellings – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of up to £120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to have access to the market for owner-occupied dwellings.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to facilitate the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct Britain's "dishonorable situation of housing".
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the cessation of "indecent evictions".
He would also like to give more power to the councils in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says, "I said last year I was going to dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the British dream – that every generation of life should be better than its predecessors.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK and companies located abroad to be able to buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, having a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "original goal" is to become manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of raising the north-east corner of the country by a team keeping their home back on their feet. The team is currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to "the stadium of lights" this summer after he had guided St Mirren back to the Scottish major league last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got on the second team and that's it," Ross says on the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"I often watched Scottish games with my father on Hampden as a child, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only be met if I succeed as club manager".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about entering the boots of his well-known predecessors in a well-known company. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At this moment, I'm going to measure my own success by whether I can return this club to the major league.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the major league," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I can pilot the team back into the major league."
Ross has only been manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's assistant manager and then for 15 months in the Heats coach group.
He then helped Alloa rise from the fall-off games of series three and raised St Mirren from falling condition to champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career on the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he took over Alloa.
"I genuinely believed I fit better as manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a fair amount of money and got to enjoy some of the relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
A player has to deal with a wide range of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running a team feels exactly the right thing to do.
I always wanted to run the team, and now I do it for a living. I feel better in my own body than I ever did in my adult life".
The full interview is to be heard on Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows
The summer heat wave has given kicks to pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% over July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures compiled by Peter Martin from Business Consultant CGA say, "Continued sunny weather and England's longer participation in the World Cup meant that July became a June-like pub with 2.8% higher sales, while the month for restaurants was worse.
The fall of 1.8% in the summer month for the sale of restaurants only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the fall in the sales of restaurants.
The pubs focused on the food side also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than the restaurant operators.
It seems that people only wanted out with drinking in mind.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, with a decrease of 3% in food sales."
Paul Newman of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel-restaurant consultancy services says, "The results continue the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors affecting the sale of the domestic dining market.
It is no surprise that the struggle of the restaurant chains continues, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly severe now that the sector is struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for food-focused operators, and only time will show if the more temperate temperatures in August bring the much needed breath.
In July, the total increase in pubs and restaurants sales, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following the sale of the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which gathers and analyses results from 47 groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, considered a reliable indicator of the industry.
A fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
One fifth of children — some as young as 11 years of age — are hiding social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study reports
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increasing phenomenon of ‘instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that the accounts can share sexual tone content
20% of students said they hold a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
A fifth of children – some up to 11 years old – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to Instagram for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that sexual tone content can be published on accounts.
20% of students reported that they hold a cleaned 'main account' for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after running into her 13-year-old daughter's secret website.
A study commissioned by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors' Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 held two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to holding secret accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle: "Sound of athletes" to the Scottish Board of Sports
Eilidh Doyle has been elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Board of Sports, taking part in the Annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience gathered by the athlete over the past decade.
"Eilidh is greatly respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as an athlete's voice and I hope I can be useful and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction."
An American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals, who won 200 m and 400 m trips at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a BBC regular commentator, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's just time to show me if I'm going to be okay and what's going on.
This has been exhausting work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I am already practicing agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertisement that equates mothers to cows shares opinions online
An advertisement similar to dairy cows by breast-feeding mothers in a breast-pump company has distributed opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a manufacturer of consumer technology, has introduced a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by a language in the cheek and a music video style-compatible advertisement describing the freedom brought by the new pump to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a barn filled with hays, among others, in the words: "Yes, I milk myself, but there is no tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not utars, they're tits."
The chorus continues, "Pum it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused debate online.
The video that collected 77,000 views and hundreds of comments has sparked conflicting reactions in viewers. Many say it makes a mockery of the daily ‘horrors’ of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk. However, their babies will be stolen from them shortly after delivery," a commentator writes.

Another viewer commented, "Understandingly, it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
The third commentator added, "The absolute reality-obliging ad."
An ad also got defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "funny" to her.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and ‘know themselves as cows'.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the commercial, the women in the video reveal that they have danced discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is imperceptibly compatible with the inside of the breast-feeding vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balar, a partner and artistic director of Mother advertising office commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the incredible feeling of freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and identifying way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During London Fashion Weeks, the mother of two children appeared on catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski's outfit using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
The number of migrant children apprehended has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the brutal rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration has made it difficult to place children in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally been made up of undocumented immigrants, and enrollment as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegal in the country, and much of them are criminals foreigners.
So we will continue to search for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with children’s cases, authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with in court within one month of the arrest rather than the 60-day time limit previously in use, the reception centre’s staff report.
Many prefer to appear through a video conference rather than personally in their case in the court of entry.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for assistance will be deported as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published by reception center workers and the system in recent months, the time spent in captivity by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child's despair may be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children suffer from trauma even now.
Syria orders the "manning forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is waging war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are in the country illegally using an excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy battle until all Syria is cleansed" of both terrorist organisations and "illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has placed a division of more than 1,000 soldiers to be torn down by battles.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for returning and accused "some Westerns" of spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these refunds," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian".
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition through a political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity for political debate.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on an area of three million people by Syrian troops supported by Russia.
However, Moualem has stressed that the treaty has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front related to al-Qaeda, "that will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a committee composed of members of the new government and opposition to establish a post-war draft Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem placed conditions on the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected to another term
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many Liberal viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled by CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Fox News, there are an average of 2.4 million viewers for the best viewing time compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached a peak on cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
"This is a flare that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," ABC's Designated Survivor program chief producer Neal Baer notes about a minister who rises as president after the attack destroyed the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather pilot jacket (Washington Post says "a pompous garment"), and the consequences of unportlaise descriptions of Stormy Daniels's President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he does seems like a reality show because part of it's about giving the public something every night," states the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Pantti Loaning Series creator Brent Montgomery Trump's show changing characters and daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you're gonna fall off.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a wonderful sunny day at his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he could not go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage himself from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

From the outside, money flows into a tight mid-election struggle
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has faced a real flow of money, as the reorganization of the congressional districts means that two candidates who have already been elected will have to fight for one place.
This newly redefined Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democratic Conor Lamb, who received his seat from another constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division was unconstitutionally favored by Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic struggle in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the March special election of the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District, widely followed in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been on the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won by 20% in the area.
Political commentators have made a fine head start for Democrats.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backed away from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the slight response from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned the hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's management team.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to recall American diplomat leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of silent policies according to which Taiwan is no longer recognized," stated department spokesman Heather Nauert in her statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 for drug control, as well as development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American State badly with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent immigrants from seeking to enter the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrators made it clear that the meeting was wanted to move forward and this effectively ended speculation on the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a signal to the mid-October meeting as to the weight of the administration's assembly, the diplomats stated.
The three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under anonymity conditions.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which there is now very powerful evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be heading the investigation into whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia became involved in the US elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go again before his constituents, and possibly be condemned by his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not saying that President Trump's defeat would be inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the ensuing years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable advance of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled since the announcement that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and wondered about the President's possible inability to carry out his duties.
According to Rosenstein, The Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest witness testimony?
And, above all, are we voting in the interim elections for a Congress that holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success in Prague because of my lesson.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table adorned by a swastika.
How could I be more than optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic about the encounter with Rapid Vienna
Rangers face Rapid Viena at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw played earlier that month in Spain against Villarreal, a victory over Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the G block of the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," says a 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Perhaps we would have been able to catch at the end of the victory, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half, and we got off on the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we will be able to give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can now push hard, leave the season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes women's sleep away
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey reported that they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents reported that they had talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't raise the issue," says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell your wishes in time.
Talk to the professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Bring financial advice to the conversation: you can also help find a way to cover these costs.
Funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-cost insurance, if you can afford it.
Draw up legal documents: block legal disputes.
Get a health care representative to identify a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the preparation of a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember, too, the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just for the financial side, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medicines are used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilframbe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police describe the attack at about 2:30 p.m. as a "occasional act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communications to the area are cut off, the rescue authorities have received no information from the area north of Palu in the municipality of Donggala, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the return since the disaster.
Key information on Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawes, located a narrow bay off the west coast of the island of Sulawes and with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the 40th anniversary of the city.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) of the coast line of the northwestern part of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative district under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The most important economic activities in the Central Province of Sulawes, and in particular in the coastal region of Donggala, are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palau and Donggala have struck several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake in North Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island in the Sumatra coastal waters.
2006: 6.8 The magnitude quake struck south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 magnitude quake struck the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1 100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the islands of Sumatra Mentawai, causing a ten-foot-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the huge damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
The eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaskan police, Pali, 29 of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as preventing and resisting home violence in connection with arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from her female companion when she tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial, and the bail is set at $500, reported by TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "unlawfully innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means that he can receive a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B violation that can be sentenced to a day of imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
Palin has not been charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving the possession of a gun under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting his face.
Veterans' groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior with a traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
In social media, videos are circulating from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspect in a NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack that claimed eight lives in New York City, a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in his October strike on the West Side Highway bike road in the south of Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report relating to the application for the death penalty in the southern administrative district of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed his eight victims "for purpose" and caused "for purpose" serious physical injuries.
The court document states that both of these charges are punishable by the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with a 22-point charge involving eight counts of murder to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this crime title in cases of organised crime. Furthermore, the charges included a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his actions "atrocious, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the indicted announcement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last time the court of the southern administrative district of New York has issued the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has last been enforced in New York City in the federal case in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court records, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He informed the investigators that his actions felt good, the police told him.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov said the defense was "naturally disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life without the possibility of being released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to those concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked him not to be required to die.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage today promised in a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lineman Peter Bone stated to marchers in Birmingham that Great Britain would "would already be out" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces the differences between his deeply divided ranks in settling a challenge underscored by conservatives in favour of being left behind, who joined a separate protest against the Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat for Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as for the pressure of the EU.
The supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a setback - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "screw the Chequers proposal off".
He suggested that Farage should be included and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I'm defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He voiced his opposition to the EU, stating, "We did not fight world wars to end up in subjection.
We want to regulate our own laws in our own country."
Bone knocked out the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely incorrect claim."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will the party members and activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added, "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their work when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians must feel the pressure if they are to spin the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit down and we're here today to tell them we don't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to spin the Brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize an army of citizens of this country who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Great Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched across Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservative security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus and smooth border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential nomination
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering the presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a masschusettian Democrat spoke about his future at city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in November in the reelection, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been thought to possibly run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters after Trump's start of the season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman at the highest place."
Arrest in case of LSU Sims shooting
On Saturday, the Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced that they arrested a person suspected of shooting at the Friday which led to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help to identify the man on it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present during interrogations, holding a gun, and shooting at the Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not engage in the arrest of resistance and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 discballs per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup after team arrangements offer him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own devices while defending his place in the first two rounds, calling Vettel on his teammates.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive a group on the tail, which should have resolved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pit a round later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after taking a little contact and after Ferrari driver moved reluctantly from the inner line, giving up defending his investment after his only two third turns move.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
He was then in charge of much of the race while prolonging the change of tires in an attempt to quickly finish and take fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th round, but was unable to increase speed in the remaining eight rounds as Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job, achieving a double victory," Hamilton stated.
Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim on Saturday that he did not leak to the public a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at an event in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of people's "indignantness, evilness and dishonesty."
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the President said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say ‘can, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document - ‘ Oi, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added the senator with a snooze.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations and letter about Ford's Kavanaugh was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not good enough for the president who commented on the matter at the Saturday event: "I'll tell you that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to get back to power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and meanness. They don't care who they hurt or over whom they have to walk to power and rule," Mediaite reports the President said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sought compensation for the loss of the Friday Belfast Giants match by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead due to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home team levels before Dwyer restored Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the men of Adam Keefe who won as underdogs at Dundee 2-1 Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute in 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pitch. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a sparkly opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched the Cown handicap goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead to the first round break while beating his second goal of the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team assembled their ranks and Bouchard again leveled with a power goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to make Dundee the first lead goal at the end of the second round. He also secured victory with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will next face their home on Milton Keynes Friday.
The pilot died as he made sure that hundreds of passengers on board managed to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers was safely airborne.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a strong earthquake and the tsunami that caused it hit the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Powerful aftershocks are testing the area and several people have been trapped among the fallen material in the town of Palu.
Although co-workers escaped with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his worktation at a wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, currently on the runway, got safely into the air.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, an Australian ABC News broadcast reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter got to Palau.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear the number of victims will increase to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have reported links with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong to be incomplete.
"The victim number is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in rubble and many people have not been reached," the agency spokesperson, Sutopo Purwo told.
Waves up to six metres [6 m] have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring help and equipment to the area.
The 35-year-old housewife Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian leader of the International Red Cross, said in an interview with CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia hastens to help the survivors, but we do not know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in his speech to the country's armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation missions.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, over 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after the plane crashed into the lagoon
Representatives of the airline of an aircraft crashed into the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, although the previous announcement indicates that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin says it has been unable to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had struck water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both announced that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane ran over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in waist deep water to emergency exits.
He reported that passenger personnel were panicking and screaming, and that he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors in the repair work of a nearby dock had participated in rescue work by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the aircraft sank in the depths of about 30 metres (hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the accidents.
An analyst presents a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended a retrial in which the man was accused of burning alive a Mississippian woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data recorded on the mobile phone when he assembled the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported having received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was contradicting his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town on that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on information recorded on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The closing arguments of the defence are planned to be launched on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of Great Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sues a couple for racist texting
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother in which she complains that she is "again one black".
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge to "torture."
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was dark-skinned.
"EIIIIIIII, TAAS TUMMAHOINEN", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, the troubled Plasco-Flaxman, according to the New York Post, had fired Maurice, announcing that their last African-American nanny to leave had done her job badly and had been expecting a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple for severance and wants $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to live and work in the family, though without contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist claims saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a well-founded solution because they could not trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco told us in an interview with Post.
"But would you leave your child to a person to whom you have been unkind, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge to blackmail and I said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start chasing another man in a situation like this?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, erasing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that the public would not identify with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after the book was adopted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It is amusing now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Realizing that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before devoted himself to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the release of the books seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington he "described as a very important family member" and stated his father was silently proud of the success it achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a boasting type at all," the daughter states.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you are proud of, even though it is not really your own accomplishment.
I think that's how he experienced Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save his life.
"Nad kept calling and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperuse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter's gonna die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs used by doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
All I could do was sit there knowing it was all about to end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned his daughter's loss, boarded a plane among other passengers who knew nothing of the trial he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That now he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and telephone number that can be supported.
Davis' son Tyler fell ill with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, living in Lydney, reports that his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile lights up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "dark."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old younger brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to even if it is a friend.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't tell me he was upset or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was quite down on Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he did not take eye contact with them or anything like that."
He states that Mark's death was a severe trauma to them, but they still have to survive: "It will break up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to go on living and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a time-limited and limited investigation - we might be able to achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would 'disperse' the deadlock caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It's a question of timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans' success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the Supreme Court of the country will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has taken up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush and met through him his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of President Bush.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently sits 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game over and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea defectors drop during Kim
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of persons who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's entry into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited the South Korean Ministry of Unity and reported that defections occurred last year in 1 127 - in 2011 there were 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been to tighten border controls between North Korea and China and to increase the prices of human smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
It is noted from Seoul that over 30,000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often they are forced to return them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on the negotiations that were stalled on the burst of nuclear armaments.
This followed the June historic meeting where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general effort towards non-nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being stuck in the position of sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will by no means begin to unilaterally dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that she was temporarily unfit to operate in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on it in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi stated of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening address, Kavanaugh was emotionally overwhelmed and occasionally almost cried out and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the committee's Democratic members without calling himself "grotesque and planned persecution" by the Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent by his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi stated.
Your fear wondered when he was asked if he would bring an impeachment charge against Kavanaugh if his choice were confirmed and if the Democrats could obtain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, including the court he's currently working on," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh currently works for the United States Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible regulations regarding healthcare reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court user.
In the hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we'd be expected to say it's great," Pelosi said.
Women have to get through everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech with months and years of rage over and he cannot hold it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't you think?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speechmate in a situation where she was angry and started to cry: "You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as the route of erupting rage, although they are usually misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I cried speechless with rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered supervisor I had always feared - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they made you feel bad."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 with a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the highly frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven proposals and the least needed was one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since campaign time had already advanced, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not enter the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave male candidates a thousand dollars, only gave him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting some discount?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings of gratitude for his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work against voters and delegates, and hatred for sexism - that he was unable to speak.
"You might have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone must be beaten into obituary.
'He cried.'"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening and although the battle is far from over, the conflict can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's most important export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties affecting imports worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded on the same score each time, last time by imposing customs duties of five to ten percent on American imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world's second largest economic power is waning for a moment.
In order to get Washington to retreat, we should give in to our own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US Trade War can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that trigger an economic downward spiral in either country and this is in fact a more dangerous possibility than the bystanders have understood to date," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant with an experience in Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of disastrous war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian government would be grateful for the help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or help from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirmed Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16,5 against 10,5 at the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe. It has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and he batted his starter punch in the water with a par-3-track 16 hole, giving a match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players who has received a result of 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America got out with a score of 5&4 against the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked world top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European ever in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, moved after the victory of the European team.
He transfers the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend in the 2&1 individual competitions played on Sunday by Tiger Woods.
"I feel tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods. I grew up with admiration for him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was of high quality throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk stated his troops failed after the show: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We regroup, I work with our American PGA and Ryder Cup committee and we move on.
These 12 guys are great, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to lift my hat.
We met our victor."
The situation of Red Tide algal flowering: concentrations are falling in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the number of algae shows a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algal areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a possible decrease in concentrations.
Red Tide algae bloom extends off the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be detected ten miles from the Hillsborough County coast, but there are fewer than last week.
Red Tide algae bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
