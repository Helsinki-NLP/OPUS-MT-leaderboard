A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall.
Only recently a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his business together."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscolic Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Forensic Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he was admitted to the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant as a chef six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family.
"Our Thoughts Are With Frank's Family and His Friends".
Louis Galicia reports that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the river.
Despite all the wrongs happening in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip number 415-575-4444.
Strikers ’ Junior Doctors Call for New Industrial Struggle
Representatives of British junior doctors (mostly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and have requested permission for further industrial action in the dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is seeking support from its entire government for additional industrial action from early September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in the July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published her letter to JDC members on Twitter, where she says that the government "blessed persistently" on questions that, according to McCourt, led to the rejection of the contract.
The letter reads, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely new draft treaty and insists that new formal negotiations are taking place on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the BMA government requesting permission for progressive expanding industrial action since early September."
Due to the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept negotiated contract terms recommended by BMA.
Malawia told BMA members at the pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved. 54,000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands as a settlement and to bring to an official conclusion the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his palace of Peter, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even by his own abstinence standard.
Recap Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin — according to one report five times.
I couldn't keep track myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his zeal just the opposite.
But Putin’s constant coolness showed that the Russian chief has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was fierce.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Duckara and accused him of stabbing her in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an assumed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to regain real confidence.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media were engaged in a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by ISIS in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it is time to move on.
In the end, this meeting was only held so that Putin received his request for an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have gained some kind of victory.
For severe, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all potential friends after he was almost deposed last month in a failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as, normally, several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has collapsed by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly breathe a sigh of relief when air transport can finally be continued.
They put their faith in the late-night rush to the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, government television has predicted a downward trend in the price of fruit and vegetables as imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tours there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article by the financial newspaper Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West has a subdued response to the coup attempt.
Not forgetting the old resentment over the ongoing negotiations on Turkey's membership of the EU and Putin's intervention, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of cool relations and to break Turkey's ties to the west.
There is no doubt that the Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own constrained concern about the change of power.
As a result, Russia and Turkey, at their summit meeting in the gruesome seaside palace, could convey an image described by an analyst as "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
Most notable is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It says a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents reported at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of differences between countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a total disaster caused by Turkey, a member of NATO, when shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the bank's operations outside Scotland are reduced to providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the broadcaster BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank's global objectives.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands into the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated by RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and personnel in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS turns into an investment brand and because of who our staff are employed because we are now becoming a bank of much more diverse brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's President.
"It would have been very sarcastic three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But our work and focus on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think time is the right time."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win in Newmarket and reached his 3,000th win
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant 3,000th wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This is the milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the track of his locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races running on a flat track.
He has previously been reached by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here, too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a major, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Dettori takes cheers with Predilection after his win
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacleboard competitions, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not surprising that it was he who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical prowess is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race ride, his enthusiasm and qualifier has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been victorious for nearly 30 years, which has been awesome to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori ventilated his achievement in a distinctive way by flying off his horse.
"From flying goals to jogging landings Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won numerous big games, including his famous win at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the non-compete ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started, but he showed an admirable strength of character, showed his skeptics and returned to his best.
And he won't be finishing his career for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until he is at least 50 years old."
Putin dismissed Mr. Sergei Ivanov, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his administrative manager, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's confidant inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a bulletin given by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Chief of the Russian Presidential Administration", but no grounds for dismissal were given.
Anton Persecution, who has been acting as Deputy Chief of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Persecution graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's Protocol Department and Government Office, reports the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the most important task for the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means to make draft laws and to monitor how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a Russian state television show meeting with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince only a few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are the firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very sceptical about the official claim that a man who has been praised as a possible President suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says, "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this highly complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been Presidential Head of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB, the State Security Service.
When Putin served as Head of the Security Service (FSB) of the Federation that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief.
As Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to a third term.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's immediate circle, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, and then returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson was fired after beating a producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produced the series, reported that they were fired in their joint press release.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the show, had made an apology on Thursday before being informed of his dismissal.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents is published later, reported in a bulletin from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series, Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first season of production, i.e. 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in a press release released on Friday.
"I hoped I could see the show to the end, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most important: the best fans the show could ever have hoped for."
The 12th season of the series begins in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Landing of Fishes in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are sandeels that have been landed by cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-cent fishes.
Queensferry's overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and the ground bridge of Queensferry's overpass, meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "cover lines" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique wire.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of Cabinet for the Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a very significant advance in the construction of the bridge, which alone has been used to build this section of the bridge with more than 30,000 concrete and steel.
Despite the massive size and weight, building the bridge section between the bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the remainder of the deck is about to receive its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, meaning that the deck is ready to be raised."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says, "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urinal column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the peak of the road and civil engineering sector.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower column's road cover, we then had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the underground) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern side of the land bridge 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and at the same time a major precision-intensive operation.
Massive, because the land bridge is 222 metres in length and about 6,000 tons in weight and was to be pulled up at an angle of gradient of about 3%.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small — only a few millimetres.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports a miracle rescue of three men
Three men caught on water from their fishing boat off Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
The marine rescue station at Moelfre RNLI made an alarm on Friday at 1.20 local time after its crew spotted an accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a director.
"We saw the boat running right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, fortunately, strong winds had carried the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while the third, aged 60, was found wearyly clinging to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who have fallen on water are still alive and perfectly fine.
There was an emergency fire cord on the boat's engine, but for some reason it had been detached from the man who was driving the boat at the time of the crash.
They really had luck on their way."
The Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have lamented why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside staring at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, screen time took only television viewing, then additionally came video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it is wonderful to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters originate from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made a cartoon series, playing cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also fell short shortly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Landing in other countries was delayed due to a massive interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In brief, players go out looking for pokémons on their smartphones, which are monitored by GPS. When pokémon is found, it can be "photos" (with the phone's screenshot) or "captured".
The wildness has caught up with a generation younger than the video game and lifted the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported, an Apple Watch intelligence watch from a Cardiogram app that discovered within two days of the game's launch that the number of 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which of the users plays Pokémon Go, it sees only the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed in deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to get cancer or depression.
Exercise helps to control weight, lower blood pressure, prevent diabetes, and bring a large amount of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-supporting things — exercise, fresh air, and the sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, even this phenomenon is deplorable to ridiculers.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they play.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
For while smartphone applications such as Fitbit could already follow your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty charm disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people leaving the hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplicity of women's rack gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
It's not a problem on the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old rack gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and grew the distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performs at the booms in the multiplicity of women's rack gymnastics finals on Thursday at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best or even the best of her generation.
Biles burst into tears as his total score of the final came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class as other superstars of sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in his sport for the past three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest rack gymnast ever."
In Brazil, there was still one final race between Bales and himself and the burden of the extravagant expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be disappointed.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver at the multi-match final of the women's rack gymnastics competition on Thursday, at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11 August 2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i for the farewell party of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of anything in advance while he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a volt series known as his trump card – has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were young and adopted and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, Boorman found the girl when she was on a day care tour in the gymnasium, where Boorman coached.
He has not lost any multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina reached a small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was still a boom and a permanto, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for final points — which was a mere formality — and tears began to appear around Bales' red, white, and blue glittering boundary color when his dream of writing his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch for a race four years ago when he first split third place but then lost to the bronze Mustafina in a re-round.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "mother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from defeat to victory, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as the Party is concerned, this tweet by a 19-year-old earlier this week and widespread tweet now has a completely new meaning:
Police report three serial killers listening to music in the car
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix in ten years. The victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police bulletin released on Thursday.
Officials say that on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the press release says.
Police suspect that the Trinity was not responsible for the robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags and $2,900 found in the possession of the second adult victim.
A spokesperson for the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
"It is common to events that they have occurred in residential areas outside homes," Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
The police also released a press release on the shooting of an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered fragments from the car seat and from the engine compartment.
Mother of a six-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things become better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital smallheadedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, whom she was not aware of when pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and may not live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing a child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there would be any more such practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund got up and started to crawl when he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of a sign by which she means "sing to me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language, but includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly may be caused by a number of different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund's case, or pregnant viral infections such as measles or zikavirus.
There are great variations in symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those who have a Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept on taking care of what's gonna happen to us,
"What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope - giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the zika virus.
"It's getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rainfall and flooding caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Louisiana governor declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rains to the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and south-west Mississippi flooded their banks and spread widely as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the Governors' Agency for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, reports that the agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahua County alone has requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service bulletin, there may be an additional 76–127 mm of water coming into the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana are projected to reach record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas Lake.
On Friday, at 9 a.m., the Tickfaw River, immediately flowing south of the Mississippi State border, in Liverpool, Louisiana, had reached a higher altitude than ever.
Rescue work continued in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday among those rescued near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He had been warned by another stepson living nearby.
"We got up, and the water came with a constant pitch," Hansford says.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford reports that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three into a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was heavily wet after the rains started on Wednesday.
Authorities report that due to heavy rains and the flooding of streets, Tangipahua County residents had to be rescued from their homes and school lessons had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council had told the CBS subsidiary of the television and radio company, WWL, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
The county leader, Robby Miller, reports that the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
For those evacuated, shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to return to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahua County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and premises of their businesses.
"For the first time we experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood seems to be similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued steady off the Gulf of Mexico, reports Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy reports that on Thursday a handful of houses flooded, but so far nothing had come to light.
Keith Townson, chief of the Shopper Value Foods store, says that he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets into his body, 6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old to have been shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents reported on CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting his first class at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted.
Another 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault weapons-type shells coming from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters present, and they have participated actively in the shooting," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police say they're going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old who was shot in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while playing off her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
By this name, I call the Olympic team of women's rack gymnastics, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin-based women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female stand gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and masterful rack gymnastics programs.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday to win gold in a multiplicity of women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, in turn, won silver.
The views are such at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be the case with rack gymnastics classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next rack gymnastics Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private rack gymnasiums run by their parents. Parents pay training costs, facilities, travels, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (to coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The premises of most rack gymnasts are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activity.
The training of rack gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorma and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached the sport enthusiasts since they started scaffolding gymnastics.
We need to provide more affordable and more accessible training on rack gymnastics for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own scaffolding gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have offered a free or affordable opportunity for rack gymnastics for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality scaffolding gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The rack gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success at school and at work.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start scaffolding, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls of different backgrounds to start their way into prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on changes in pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the so-called junior physicians, who participated in the vote, rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt reported plans to enforce the agreement and said the British public health system (NHS) was "no one's land" and that any further delay is harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors move on to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care during anti-social times.
The chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night in which she says, "Junior doctors are still very cautious about the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even reacting in no way to attempts at discussion.
I did, despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strikers in the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British trade union staff representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to engage in new strikes.
Mortimer says, "Labour battle actions achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already-extremist teams and services and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
Workers were hopeful that a continued positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May between employees, Health Education England in charge of health education and the Ministry of Health."
In the day about €2.40 a medicine that pays may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive about €2.40 a day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer periods of time.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in heart disease patients.
The medicine is currently given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS) has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS) has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people have a heart attack each year, a quarter of whom relapse or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fatty substance that accumulates in the blood vessels walls, which breeds plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it may cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot falls off, it can pass with the circulation and prevent the flow of blood into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by British AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of plugs.
The draft NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that ticagrelor be administered next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and an additional twice daily dose of aspirin for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the NICE Center for Assessment of the Introduction of Treatment Procedures says, "Although effective treatment methods for preventing disease progression and symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people benefiting from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that the treatment method be used for a longer period of time.
Due to the climate of political correctness, the vote fraud in Muslim regions flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from his post last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The atmosphere fostering political correctness led to the closing of eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report released today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticized police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to electoral fraud for "due to hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, known as the former Minister of State and the current anti-corruption force figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be dipped in indelible black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to whistleblowers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for better access for journalists to Government documents and decisions by informal boards and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal at East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year a special election court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman be dismissed from office due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The court held that Rahman "wrongly" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rahman was said to "use as the basis of his campaign that every believing Muslim had a religious duty to vote for him".
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be another person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern over the postal election fraud, in which members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made several suggestions to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, especially in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"It was concerned that... government institutions had closed their eyes to such action because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the processing of postal ballots from political activists, in order to prevent the "harvesting of votes".
The report currently under review by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Baptizing fingers in indelible black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality of voters and the right to vote.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail vote.
Refusing political activists to process the votes sent by filled mail and mail voice mail envelopes.
The right of the police to form watch chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law so that it is easier to raise intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training in order to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person is allowed to enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London Police and finds it "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for his role due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and criminal evidence threshold exceeded on many grounds".
He also criticizes the inefficient "ration checks" of the wards responsible for the electoral lists of the city council.
"The decision given by the Court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a revival," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its denial by some quarters."
The resemblance of an Olympic cyclist with Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers fad Rio at the Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship to have a resemblance with a known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance with Hollywood celebrities is evident.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the men's archery team in the United States has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on cycling tracks, many people have quoted in social media how a archer could be an actress favorite Leonardo DiCaprio's twin brother.
Brady Ellison, a U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter after the images of him, in which he startlingly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted having heard since childhood that he resembles DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance as that big, maybe with the exception of the beard and mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the 2012 London Games, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were shrugged at the resemblance, no doubt even more highlighted in these games.
Aliya Mustafina, a large and expressive Russian gymnast, has been called the double being of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
In the bathing tracks, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for the Glee television series for years.

Similarly, for a long time the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been listed, highlighted by both powerful eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and white hair, while US team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, a "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted to see the resemblance as well.
This user wonders if the couple's resemblance is a good reason.
A tweeter recently expressed his delight when "other people on the Internet agree with Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter's resemblance".

Many have also found resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the broad smiles of the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna on fire! by Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay shocked CBC's direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disguised" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to launch his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the time of the second leg of the message 1:57.79, and stayed 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone of the commentator and the use of the language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who swam in the finals of the Women's 4 x 200 m freestyle message, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with ferocious Byron MacDonald critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #responseist."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's words: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologise for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued their regrets to over 90 other tweeters' comments complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, for these statements and for getting them on the air.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret on the air and tried to justify his speeches by saying that he did not mean it as a personal matter.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relaying," MacDonald said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I meant nothing demeaning by my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, the woman who adapted underwear in the middle of the store shocked customers
The customers didn't know where to watch a woman undress in the middle of Primark to try on panties.
He further worsened the situation by assessing what he looked like in underwear, taking them off the leg, and putting them back on the shelf.
He went on touring and eventually tried four pair of underpants at a store in Folkestone, Bouverie Place Shopping Center.
A Primark chain store in the Folkestonen Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two at the same time in the store, says that after experimenting with underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People could not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone stared at him when he took his tried underpants off the leg, and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks – and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the panties he had come for."
Davidson, 33 years old in Kent town, continues, "How disgusting to think that someone will take home their underwear that someone else has worn and not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff sought to remove those items of clothing from the sale after the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take new panties home and discover that someone else has tried them without having been washed since then," adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesperson commented by saying, "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York City, Rhon Mizrach, and asked for advice on how to cope with a mugger or abuser waving a gun at close range.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it falls between your elbows and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groin, and when he goes double for pain, slap him in the face with a gun barrel and back off by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technology is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the gun, and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video for how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, though, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash — unless you are the Grand Master of Krav Maga.
World Traveler Ian Wright, who makes a travel guide, licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and cacomist reflex to a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk's host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance to strength by licking euro banknotes, hand rail at Piccadilly Circus, train toilet flush button and Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers what he was pushing his tongue into.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of internal force, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the toilet button on the train may be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are found in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals for strengthening good intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad taste of mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
There is no doubt that licking the rails and toilet flush button challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been quite careless about my health since I was a child and put into my mouth things like dirt, worms and curly water."
In the film, he really proved himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The border met only in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
By comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually below 60.
The border came up against the Russian general bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units – in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures along with Valio in a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of internal power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of internal power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio Geftilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, Wright was given the Valio Gephilus, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the category manager for Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, says, "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and we finally ended up thinking about asking Ia to come along."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks shot on tape."
In a 2015 poll by Valio, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products with added lactic acid bacteria.
Before their eviction, the disturbance family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall
The disturbance family left behind £50,000 in damage to the town-owned rented house after they had been evicted for terrorizing the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company stated that the apartment was in repair condition, shocked.
There were gaping openings in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, trash had been spread on floors, and walls had been stained with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh about, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, just like its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family's tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and care, and loud shouting, fighting, and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received a decree on anti-social behaviour in June.
Old garbage was found in several rooms of the house under the demolition threat.
In the past, drugs had been sold out of the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
According to neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency evicted the couple by coercion this week after giving them first 11 weeks of extra time to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for eviction — they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have come here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of forced fillings at the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called in.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the ferocious wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant took no responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This incident was very difficult, for the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community who took part in the work and offered to boldly provide us with information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their 20s.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean up the garbage heaps around the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis and additional scales and other supplies as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug with the intent to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms had been graffitied.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules on leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they wish without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-catching army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft crashed to a staggering low level.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over the full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes near touch from tourists taking sun on the sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet as they were understandingly concerned about the thunder of the jet engines, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographers of a dramatic fly-by and videos of vacationers released on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing down."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight intended to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke caused by nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said that this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused devastation in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility of the sand fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight that asked the pilot to identify the fishing vessels.
The results of the first half of the executable are better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made €3.4 million better than planned.
The result of the exes was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where institutional care has been dismantled by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was fulfilled in all activities.
This year, the exote aims to shorten the ranges of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border jägers took a military oath at Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
An inauguration of the 10th Special Cross-Border Course took place at the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special borderer.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border jägers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime border forces were involved in a veteran's meeting in connection with the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A lot of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating the RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The function of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit includes a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civil person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the rest of the police.
In turbulent, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the party until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, its less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit was established in each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Crime Police, runs operations nationally.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to police services and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your area
As the individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing, and is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, the author forms a certain image.
Serialisation can be done on the basis of either the method of making or the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent criminal-fighting attempts by the police.
The police will publicly report the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news of early summer, the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housebreaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
Pre-trial investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The clever ones order the District Court minutes, for example, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station, and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
ISIS-related London schoolgirl was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasname Akunjee reports that the girl's family heard Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, which is an ISIS base in Syria, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going to the war zone - and that will cause people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
Sultana, together with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court Judge if elected president.
Senate Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
According to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the next president elects the person to fill the seat of late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
In a phone conference on Thursday, Reid said that he predicts Clinton to choose Garland with "quite great certainty".
Reid's spokesperson later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "smuggle the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals in the District Court of Columbia.
Reid says that Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are "commanders" and "adjutants" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
According to him, Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men
Ttreats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity bottom models, they want to find the top models of the next generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of the Treats, reported earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old school Playboy magazines, as he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We have to bring back timeless and classical nudity, where women, even men, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures that praise the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women surely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art".
Those who wish to be a model on a calendar can send their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York City.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write in the comment section under the title of your angry objection NoväAll SolitaryMen of Middle Ages, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is no millenial generation boom behind the much-spoken new arrival of vinyl records, when the millenians want to feel the physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle-aged nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
Those in the age group 18–24 are in fact the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of enthusiasts to grab records, but the importance is emotional: older vinyl disc buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% v. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% v. 66%).
But are you Gov's results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the busy Soho Street, wearing a jewelry-free gray jacket suit. I would get busy, bend my hand into a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness, when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over premises previously owned by private entrepreneurs, however, a handful of special record stores remain.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and character.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray movement (as customers at that moment by two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (as customers at that moment eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) are on a meeting trip in London for an afternoon and spends their extra time exploring the supply of stores.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I've got about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly on his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they originally appeared, and to buy again things he had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people affected by media hype. These people have heard about the coming back of vinyl records and are now forced to buy back their old records.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
What, then, about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comfort community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may upset some vinyl fans, to whom returning to familiar disk cases means permanence and reminding them of the lucky days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or material possessions are acquired for some comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off it."
"We're like social workers!" sips Wez's co-worker from behind the record stack.
An ICM opinion study conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to their record.
The opinion poll also reported that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl disc buyers do not have their own record player.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while looking at a stack of Bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also associated with the "pocal phenomenon" discovered by Jonny, 42, the seller of the Sounds of the Universe (at that moment three middle-aged men).
"A client recently came into the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is considerably more varied in the Fop, which I arrive at next. The store has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl plates.
The customers are couples in their early 70s, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers delights, although the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of swinging jazz from speakers, Wild Beasts' latest sex-flung synthesizer pop.
None of the customers look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and has been watching a variety of albums on sale.
He's watching rather than shopping.
He says that his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
The music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is...", he lets go of the fond sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a group of teenage girls who would think of jumping jeans, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and a daughter who were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a stairway with wall filled with records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and part so high that they can't even be reached.
They're pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money in the industry and send some customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl discs.
Although my research shows that YouGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won't be spending their Thursday morning snooping around at Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a television host who stares scaryly and looks at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark scientist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was obtained for an age of 272–512 years in the study, a female of five metres in length.
The French court dismissed an application for the dismantling of the jungle camp's shops
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities calling for dozens of temporary shops and restaurants to be demolished in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to disband 72 temporary trades established in a refugee camp, selling people in a refugee camp different items from tobacco to energy drinks and offering hair clippings.
According to Calais prefect authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a black economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals provided by the government-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the increasingly growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect "fully understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants in the camp are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the demolition threat was the Camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring children's cafe to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
Two charitable organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that since the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record population of over 9,000.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland is falling sharply to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second most in those EU countries with a similar level of wages.
In the United Kingdom, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices hit close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The Russian import bans on food are now weighing the price, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen heavily.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of EU countries with a similar wage level to that of Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same level of wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and continue to compete in prices," says Lehtinen.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan indicates official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, learning about fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding begins in schools.
Swedish education will begin in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education will begin to be studied in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
In this way, an effort is being made to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) known as ice sharks does not reach maturity until the age of 150.
It can live after that for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over northern Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, can grow up to over five metres tall.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year according to the results, adult individuals have forcibly lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined adult ice sharks from the ages of 28 females caught in fishermen's traps.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent Amazon fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice-fin females reach maturity only over four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - no less sellers
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a troubled company ended in early August.
"As a result of negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann says in his press release.
It states that the number of suppliers in the department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, around 80 support workers are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store pay.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store is still losing.
According to the acting CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Personal deductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018, says Veijalainen in the bulletin.
The result improvement of the second quarter was motivated in particular by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north... temperature below 20 degrees across the country.
The center of low pressure over the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, meteorologist of HS.
There are showers also in the central parts of the country, but there is a pout further south.
The temperature is no longer very summertime, as mercury in the whole country is below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees are left.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah attempted to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leadership, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," the president of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Teke, on the other hand, thundered at the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way to fourth place and is a front-runner of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only ran on an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials faced him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium following athletics.
On Friday, Rio began the struggle for athletic medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first - day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
There was another four years ago in London, where the stadium bulging from cheering crowds.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics' lack of spectators has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of vacant benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes at Talita Antunes and Larissa, Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000-person stands were filled.
Bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
Although even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, told the weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold by the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1,000 for the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in vacant seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less known species such as golf and rugby for schoolchildren in the country.
Rio Stadium had plenty of vacant seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Central Salo competed in London 2012.
There was a lot of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Private, companies and entities can then cash in on the holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by willing parties for payment of the right of holder.
The holder is entitled to veto its 187-square block, which in practice means that no holder is required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as inheritance or gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself to something to protect nature," says Juha Leviakangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The person acquiring the right of control will receive precise location information from their section, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of holders who have acquired rights on the Foundation's website are displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Levikangas sees the risk of its acquisition of nature conservation only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turkey most of the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves most torment Turkey from the large cities of Finland.
Compared to the population, more bikes have been stolen there this year than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of bike thefts reported, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January and August of this year, calculated on a per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, a double number of thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of residents compared to others," describes police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by the amount of bike traffic in the city and how many wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it very expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling towns.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city where city centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary vehicle for mobility," says Reen.
In Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have come to the attention of the police in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and about 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a theft of a bike, although fewer than one in ten reported cases are found.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where police are informed of theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Events can also be found in other investigations, when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug case in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses, and bike cellars, for example, in practice wherever they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopos are most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other kinds of locks.
Some thieves take the wheel for short - term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not become known to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I bet some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant, as he may commit a concealment offence or violation.
"An alarm clocks should ring if a wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underpriced price," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa for his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Moose says. "Never been taken, has been a good monk in that regard."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves so much, it may not even have a hipster value," Helvi, from Helsinki, ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was a quick customer in the Helsinki Kallio kiosk, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was hanging against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, as this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time hears from friends that wheels have been taken."
"Most of the bad bikes, such ruckus Jopos".
A bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the house company from the wake itself a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve was expecting it to be taken.
The responsibility of people under 15 for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury teams familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is involved in the first crime committed by a youth.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used side by side.
"Everything guides the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
Peer jurorship has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflexes what happened with about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you continue along the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Helsinki Project of Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influences want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed instead of Trump's campaign to the congressional election.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring the Democrats a landslide in these elections," the letter says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the congressional election can Republicans be prevented from drowning a Trump-enriched anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is prominently opposed to Trump by Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the United States economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handout to American workers who suffer after factories migrate to countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builders, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax of departure," Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As President] I oppose any trade agreements that act against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced on Monday by Republican Donald Trump for "only favoring millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that she herself was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton pricked.
Such are Rio ratings: Games have not glued Finns to squares, but mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports games are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympic Games have not reached a staggering number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships of one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships were well over another million.
For the time being, the most interesting Olympic sports have been the Sunday night cycling and the fifth race day-opened rack gymnastics, both of which reached nearly half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Yle Sport, is pleased with the ratings, and reminds us that viewers will be divided at the Rio Olympics for the first time into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the overall selection of the Olympic Games by a large number of TV viewers.
Even on the television side, viewers divide into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports games for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are from 20,000 to 500,000 viewers throughout that time, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland during nighttime.
Another reason for the weak interest - if someone now thinks it is weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings at the start have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most download free app in Finland during the first days of the Games at Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get network ratings until later". Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not operated on all users as hoped.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained that should correct the errors.
Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio, Yle Speech transmits games every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the back of the cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technology dive instructor, found a 20-square-foot imprint on the Crossback, with a depth of 104 metres on the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres," says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for the time being, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not reach the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29: Corrected last song where the deepest lakes in mid depth were wrong.
Ideal for a tax bill: Pensioners' taxation is still strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more strained than that of employees.
An Ihalainen says that the malpractice came up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
This is not included in the government proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the election," he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners were subject to deductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in parliament, who grilled Alexander Stubb, then finance minister, about election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in a line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-earned competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
In the run-up to long-term unemployment
The idol appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in a budget debate.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in the Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to cancel their trip to Thailand due to the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following," Westphalen says.
In Thailand, very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season dates to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thailand travellers come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to pursue Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No record of the author
Westphalen says there's no record of who did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may be related to political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population is brewing, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks should affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket, popular by tourists, and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the resort island Phuketilla exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded, according to the paper, in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in each double bomb attack.
In addition, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than in southern Thailand and in the town of Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to transport to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta that dominates Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any further, he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finnish residents to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the guidelines on caution, says Westphalen.
In the wounded Europeans
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
A little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin has been available.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was, according to the provincial governor, hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won a women's four-game
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still pursues rack championships at the Rio Games with a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the point of mind over the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row as well as the boom last and last year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team race world championships.
Dimer World Cup medals Biles has jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this," Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The office of Huovila's company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the shops on Main Street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half-three o'clock a day in Thailand time at Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the scene of the attack.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men fitting the description hidden in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank the people who tipped me off.
Research Director on Russia's leadership changes: A clear move away
On Friday, Russia underwent the highest-ranking leader change in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Persecution, 44 years old, with Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as second-in-command of Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from garnering too much power.
He adds that recycling management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up independent power for themselves.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in conflict with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, is taking on special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the amendment to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other tasks and suggested Persecution in his place, said Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view this is a clear drop in station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin changing his immediate circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected prior news at 19:30: Earlier we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document public policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Health from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Home Ministry previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening Sanam.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the data had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to the STT that the need to reform practices has been identified in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has run against time under the high-ranking championships.
He injured his back thigh in the early season and had to skip the Jamaica Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dress samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter primary rounds at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and rival self-reliance despite the final festival at the time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career law point with a clock measured.
World records of 9.58 in 100 metres and 19.19 in two hundred born in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-meter world record and a 19-second low, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's hard challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the dignitaries if he has only been on the way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup finale was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and Rio's races are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese swimmer in Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, the Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping cases to the International Court of Appeals for Sport for CAS.
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide would have been found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent Rio to the home of an athletic coach because of a doping offence.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, reported that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media records, this is Kenyan express coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps is unstoppable - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps swam in a 200-meter mix his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps reached the Olympic gold of the same species as the first swimmer in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview with Evening Magazine.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if social media or the British press has small noises about his revealing and extraordinary costumes.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high heels and a short dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to impress and perhaps startle, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that this has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a stir from scratch if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests for suspected terrorist activity.
On Thursday, Rio police announced that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the Games' security surveillance.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as police arrested as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have ties to the Isis interlocutor organization.
The detainees had reportedly instigated violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed in, among others, the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their early part of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after having controlled the blasting of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the blasting of the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and didn't let the audience in until after.
The drink woke up the race for the sleepy-starting Spanish team.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the races, won Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two games, Spain reached silver.
The police already completed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road cycling target last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their initial section of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame made Petäjä-Siren - Finnish pondered the protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine dame poked Wind Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped," Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach, told.
Athletes considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because it would have been pointless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could have been compensated," Petäjä-Siren stated.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish was left in number 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The car accident on the tip didn't have much effect.
Friday is an important day when you have to race the departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, lengthen the age
Science has studied everything between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his or her life is extended.
On the other hand, things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to average body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to spend your time picking up a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "the reduced risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is advocated by studies that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, a study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in the rest of the human body.
A survey conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected human life.
The seven-year project was monitored by over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more gruesome persons 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also lengthen the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he must also have orgasm.
The exercise will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute solitude.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete at the Olympics or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live beyond the usual chubby.
A lot of research has been trying to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years into his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour among people aged over 65 found that the person shopping daily was likely to be a less frequent parent.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So put your credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpihuma derailed into a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car collision occurred in Koskella, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in Koskella, Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car received had drifted in the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left up in the lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The emergency services removed the injured driver from the car and were transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The women's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of a felony DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range because the mail had delivered some of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernivo, was on Thursday buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So, if there's no traffic in the lawn cut, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to cover lawn mowers.
The lawn cutting is available to the Post until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign to be mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the upgrade struck me with surprise.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention this issue attracts is incredible, Haltia wonders.
Friday night, Haltia's upgrade had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Elt was able to catch his own favorites in a loose candy bag, although a few tins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Evening Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five platforms strayed to the wrong place (Wall River) yesterday and we no longer went to do part delivery (Saloon) in three, but we only took five platforms today, the Kaidesos told the Evening Sanomat.
The evening Sanomat was the first to announce.
Teija Halt was not indignant with the sign because he found all his own loose candy favorites in the selection.
A dizzy diet! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost tens of pounds since his child was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a photo pair on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed at a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her dieting work as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his staggering performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Before and after Backlund, a pair of images have collected several laudable comments from co-decorators.
You're gorgeous.
We're on the same road, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project to do it now.
Your pictures give me terrible strength and enthusiasm, as one of them tells me that the journey is the same as the journey.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds on the project to do it now.
At that time, he told the Evening Magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was ten pounds away.
During three months of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
Hope of the family of a woman murdered in Lowis: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered by donating instead of flowers and petitiones for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's desire for donations in favour of police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed his nurse training there.
The Veterinarian Station recalls a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and job-free.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening newspaper that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The suspect in the murder, a 27-year-old man, did not know the woman and they had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest situation.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to reserve the salary of an employee who refused to teach a temporary agency worker, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the tutor's salary, which corresponded to the share of orientation in all day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage under the Non-Discrimination Act on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Union of Posts and Logistics (PAU)'s Organizational Decision on the Ban on Education.
During the November post strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarise themselves with agency workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first told about the matter.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Federation.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Secretary of State Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin dismissed the head of his administration - replacing the Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Chief of Presidential Administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin reports.
The farm is home to Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Persecution's grandson Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, reports the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's bulletin, Ivanov, who was part of Putin's tight inner circle, is taking over the special tasks of environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other tasks and suggested Persecution in his place, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's reelection in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the gaming ban - not seen in the opening of the Premier League
The World Recorder of Football Transfers is not seen on the field when the England Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed along to England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition by Paul Pogba is on the sideline due to a ban on the game as ManU opened his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus EUR 105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by Juventus' ban.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the league's second round on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grand madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event starred by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event Thomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's rather unusual in the productions of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations, says Thomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 in the last year by 5,000 persons.
The festivals also present a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being controlled in huge corridors.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been swelled over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grass-plated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, the concert venue this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
The Rock admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigot, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
For the Rock, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for about EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR six million.
It can be used to produce "creasy things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is the legend of punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because now is probably the last time this is seen on a show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded locally on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and over 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, reported police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife patron in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish touristist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than, local time.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs were detonated on the island of Phuket, which was popular with Finns.
No one was reportedly killed.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
Police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently seized heavily on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will go to battle first in the event of war
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to battle until several months after taking a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of conscripts serving 5.5 months in the event of war, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable.
According to the head of training, the first task is to recruit reserve personnel.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for an assignment that has not been trained as required," Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training garrisons for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensations from the mold house.
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious problem of moisture was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in order to be demolished in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of up to EUR 198 000 to Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both district and court courts.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of legal proceedings and liquidation of the couple for a total of EUR 47 344.
The right to moderate the price reduction slightly, as buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors revealed were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looked for a home in good condition
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and faults of ventilation and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, it was not apparent from the discussions that there was any urgency at all.
Tola and Waroma remained in the impression that rainwaters coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The stores were made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than was thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, were due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the ground moisture that rose capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air was estimated by the inspector to be also accessible to the interior through the porch.
The mold or yeast that makes the health risk possible, beyond the limit values, was found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the windower in the living room, and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also argued whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes to the dwelling had been made in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were not yet any appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finnish people in the register
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, have documents stored for microfilms regarding a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Racial Bureau operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted in women to find out.
The Bureau of Race investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Office handwritten biography and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Racial Bureau wanted assurances that women were "child lovers", "saved", and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, whether in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the Holocaust Museum of the United States.
Instead, Nazi demographic politics focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, the museum website states.
"Siren the Betrayer, 6th, Nirkko rose and fell"
Tapio Nirkko finished third in sailing at the first departure of Finnjollie's day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the entire group as the top of the tail at the second departure of the day.
The nirk rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class day at number 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained number 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hung over"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's bartender to the 1995 Tango King, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää can still bounce, and he is currently in a huge lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer, was released today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The bridgehead's career became a total uplift as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Bridgehead sang bars, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go quite as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that became a huge hit would not immediately be guessed that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to insist on being perfect and peaking.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, as reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner and the incident eventually ended up in the Texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song lyrics ordered from Sarah Törmäsä were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the breakup song were not true, but was written on the basis of the news from 7 days.
The newspaper's news reported that Jar and his ex-lover's resignation was attributed to Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was total nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and so it was good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, although polls during the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics radiates in its latest monthly survey from the professional community responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economicists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were particularly grievanced by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much space to only a couple of percent of economists in favour of the EU distinction, as by the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hungry press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, and LSE and other economic power combinations are about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters, in their opinion, have no common interests.
The academics such as Economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrant congestions your hospital, Immigrant exploits you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get a place of school if they were to be removed?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are held by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations for the victory of the "Plan B", a camp that is in favour of EU separation, began to be made in case the result was left behind.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen about Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to old age, the standard level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trade
When the camp for EU separation won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, these looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close the store, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling the money out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it's going to be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
Open funds affected by closures dominate about four per cent of British properties.
Aberdeen's lockout lasted for six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might stick to the 2017 side of its fund.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ragged downwards, but the situation does not look more "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate of pounds and dollars is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought a negative impact on London's real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look too good yet.
But at 4:00 when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, the British real estate fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for power.
I realized that this is going to Plan B now, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight for work.
The City of London was already fully alive, despite the morning.
TV screens normally set to silence at the office made the news sound, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live," says Vanhanen.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdee, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished the two real estate transactions after the Brexit vote, i.e. Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was in a way calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the property market in Britain, especially in London.
In the coming years, the London office premises were forecast to be up to 20% negative.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tusk has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on Vanhanen's face.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what Brexit is going to do.
So much is still open: how the difference will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the subject of initial information.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minuses amounted to 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with Lehman's collapse and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales of that time, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a normal fund-raiser.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing movement is no wonder to him - one could have been in front of Brexit without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other first cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a really high level.
London prices have tightened up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that the properties are the last ownership class to be globalized," says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
Moreover, prices have been boosted by low interest rates, which, for example, forced pension companies to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices leveled out last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change in the way we expected, and now it came.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
Much he dares not judge the future, but says that there is hardly a chance of a rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady road ahead.
Old man has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of its victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also spread," says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register purchase information more accurately than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you eat, as today the trading group said it was beginning to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once so far information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will begin to pick up it from purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods bought with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most efficient channel is email.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to a change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to only grocery purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and there is no such programme for this time.
Finland's Near Finland has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with the Selection Houses, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting data at product or product product level, we remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says Anu Ora, the commercial leader.
According to him, the customer loyalty program is scheduled to be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
In the beginning, the experiment
SoK's customer-owner and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
The basic information includes not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-Etusi card purchase has a date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data are recorded at product group level so far in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK's customer owner and partner operations.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in bags in any case, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his or her stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, the cashiers are unable to access the data, emphasizes the Sarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador Retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a can of powder gas-flavored shells.
The powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for online trade
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main workplace in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused action at Customs and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
The second main reason for training the gun and explosives dog for Customs' duties is postal mail through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, as many as 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to arms, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials from online shopping, passenger aircraft's luggage and air cargo.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate recorded baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether additional weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and military experts to train with Heila.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to go without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the evening Sanomat loses the camera mike cap to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cap immediately from the "irti" order.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on the work vest, similar to Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
They have a working age of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work shares only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was applied for about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
The mini-state got their first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
Fiji Olympic gold of less than one million inhabitants in rugby is valued in the country so high that the government has ordered the 22nd August national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was closed.
The day off is taken the day after the team's return home.
There will also be festivities for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded with his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 pounds (75 kg) of thrust and 145 pounds (145 kg) of rapture.
His combined score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her push at the last 175 pounds, as was her second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by ferocious roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish farmer was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Betting League - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player on our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from around the world.
Little by little, the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen reported in the bulletin.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Statina Flora, where in 109 games he scored a total of 51 goals.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
There was a need for a new attacker for RoPS when last season goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star shone again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a friend of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again flaunting by presenting her haughty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media with very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see it, you can check it out here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood shape-shift" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and grew up in the Kardashians era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-standing fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fabulous mirör aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start the Northern Light Trips in early autumn," says Visit Finland in the press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Light Tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
The winter northern lights in Lapland are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light Season starts early in the autumn and goes on long into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirör aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twofold fabulous, says Anne Lind, acting marketing manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Northern Light Campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among others.
According to a survey carried out by researchers at Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese could use clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have tremendous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby-7 race when the Fiji champion team won gold
UK's impressive success in the seven-player rugby race broke crushingly when Fiji won it on Thursday in the finals played at Rio's Deodoro Stadium by 43-7.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball handling, transfers, side hallucinations, support game, running lines and brutal force and thus won gold – if there was the first Olympic medal in its entire history for the country.
The defeat marked silver, which was a slightly thinner comfort for Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-time rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win from the South African Boxes by number 7–5 in the semi-final earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full strength.
Great Britain may find comfort in the fact that at least one British gets a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's coaching at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started excellently and introduced her tackle skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team collided with a number of moving buses, and world champions took 5–0 to the lead when Osea Kolinisau made the crash to the corner.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12–0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the rugged Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it did not slow Fiji down for long.
After the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu scored on the right corner, after which the UK was 17–0 in a loss.
Nakarawa scored a second goal for a further start, with the first half playing time still more than a minute left.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the more powerless tackles of the UK team and crashed over the goalline.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in situation 29–0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British still play apprentice in the sport.
Which is very true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes during the half-time and managed to hold down Fijians for whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to an excellent team game by the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36–7 by scoring for the UK on the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelagos whose fans sang, waved flags and danced.
Fiji’s pure joyous attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame scored a final touchdown on the Fijians' cake by scoring in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won in Japan's semi-finals by 20-5 and the UK had faded past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goalline with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is as emotional as any gold could be at this race.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 victorious bets into history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were the two, the boat echoed in third place the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in the history of British sport to reach a similar achievement.
Their superiority was beyond doubt, the victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record for them.
What we see, the two brilliant athletes gliding on the water surface like swans to age, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to taking the two toward achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who, 30 months ago, was diagnosed with cancer and who did not then know if he would see today.
According to Williams, the situation at the time was tight.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the suspension caused as little harm as possible if now this kind of circumstance could even be said.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the Royal British Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says, "On an hourly level I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash register have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so, thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the past five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their rivals have failed to match.
Even on the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duo began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very caught in the moment.
Helen said, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not seek to do anything wonderful.
We didn't pursue the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two think a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland trades the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by Panama data leaks already call for in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election date is now set for October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the election result of autumn.
In June, in the presidential election, criticalness towards those in power was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran outside of politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest fuss.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and a Democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clintonk's organization.
The Democratic Party became enraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink that low as a commander-in-chief of the army, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has prohibited the use of a burkini swimsuit preferred by Muslims on beaches, reports, among others, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing costumes, which display religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two extremist men connected to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Blue algae turret in Lake Pyhäkösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been observed on the beach of Lake Pyykosjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal in the seaside water of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
Blue algae opacity observed at Lake Pyhösjärvi's beach does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the surface of the water as rafts.
Environmental action monitors the situation by frequent inspections.
If blue algae condensation turns into blue algae bloom, the bathing area will also be informed separately.
Check here for the results of the bathing water samples.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation of forest farm change.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax change proposal.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the VM assumes that a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry will prevent it from making a loss in the capital income of forestry which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners, according to him.
The tax deduction bound to the value of forest profits is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he said, it eliminated 82% of Finnish forest owners from the area of deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the holding.
According to Hakkarainen, forestry policy has taken the reduction of forest gifts for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A strong hailstorm caught the motorists at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
A special chase occurred on Kalajoki's Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two consecutive cars derailed into a ditch, after which the one behind collided after the one driving ahead.
According to Harri Pyhätkä, the emergency firemaster, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind us had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the above was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga to a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantity of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medicine by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The research results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
Muhos' family home killing continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder conviction for another perpetrator
The threshing of Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both of the doomed.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family home killing at Muhos.
The second received 8 years for 4 months of killing and aggravated robbery, including as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a more severe man.
The prosecution calls for a milder punishment for murder committed as a young person to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and had the young man come into his room, when one of the young struck him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the state of mind study, at the time of the act, both of the condemned were in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from a family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, growing only at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
The ice shark, or halker, that swims in the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by only one centimeter a year.
Only a species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Financial Wiseness - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if the change to corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax reliefs benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary while presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1 000 billion a year that would not be collected.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "Thought" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American aircraft to unite cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel to lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday Finnish time.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally tumultuous, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street riot - a reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarized the essence of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy on the side, the preceding Skin where I live (2011) the peaks of a career in Spanish cinema.
On a level, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is the serene love, relationship and family drama of the conventional, centered on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen as much as a long flashback.
Life appears to be on its model for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, from the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will be added to the second female lead, TV-known from the series The time between the sutures (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a cuckoo, but I myself would say that time sly and literally with a single wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such distinctive blizzardness down to humor in Julieta has a fair distance.
It is a flatly played, restrained, place in places with good music and quite saddened film with elements of elegia as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish instructor is still present and gradually begins to put into the eye more as a pure form than as a working dramatic power.
The film’s characters are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only by sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is specific in these matters, but the main thing, or the tunings of the current scene, is not particularly improved.
When mechanical repeats, the impression is outward and somewhat inanimate.
Almodóvar has made the manuscript based on three short stories by Alice Munro, a Canadian who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally superior to the drama, the amount of big things - especially gnawing guilt - the film's the subject of the thematics.
Director and Screenplay: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiere is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
New cuts are not made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out in lots.
There will be no further surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is the conviction of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (secondary) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits debate.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
♪ The locals are haunting ♪
Why are the ministers so keenly emphasising the fact that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallupit reports that the Government Party of Peruvians expects a blizzard defeat, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, much of which next spring will be realised by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the ability of the basic Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
First of all, new cuts are not going to be used to obscure the fact that next year they will be brutally carried out and, secondly, to try to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Major Surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion into account next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise their hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts on the former ones in the 2017 budget run.
The budget would at least be dashed close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will receive what comes.
These measures do not give rise to deleveraging
It is quite clear that the current measures do not give way to debt, even though Juha Sipilä tries to stimulate a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the information conference on the budget prove this irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has barely risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion next year, which will in practice be fully covered by new debt.
This is the perception of the city centre, the assembly and the Finns of Peruvians as to what is responsible.
Poll: A lot of tasks are being left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the KAKS - Research by the Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the nation also rolls responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with mental disabilities are the most clearly desired responsibility for the region.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks entrusted to the state by the municipalities.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcycle rider from Joensuu ran off the police patrol in Joensuu at Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half-time.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle running without lights, but a young man went on to drive the police out of fair speeding.
The chase continued on Sonkajanrantantie, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran after the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch at Kulvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved corner out of the road and fell into a ditch on its side.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the car owner.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil ran into the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Lahti village of Ilmajoki in southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six feet [165 cm] tall, slender and good - postureed with white hair that extends under the jaw.
Observations and hints of lost movements are asked to call the Northland Situation Center tip number 0295440513.
The elements of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest damage
The crash flow that brought down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially up and running, and the event can also be held next year.
The final performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night in a torilla.
On Saturday, the program continues with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The crash flow occurs in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward air flow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, thus cooling the air mass and accelerating its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash flow.
The crash flow hit Parafest in the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child in the group who was transported slightly injured to further care.
Air pollution obsolescences Londoners
According to the study, the skin in London ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
A British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than, say, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Small particles that aging the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to the Evening Standard, nearly 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel their business trips walking near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular cleaning of the skin is recommended as a practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further examinations seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Rejoice with renewed strength for the coming season
The League-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, leaves for the series starting in October for a better starting point than male memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in the previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienna.
Jani Säsäsä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as entrepreneurial and united.
From the foreign trio, the mid-defender Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
New faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared on the Rwandan national team, is a 2.5-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jampanen has played in almost all the Salbandy World Cup since 2003.
Now there are already sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salbandy national team.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumper, 48, says.
Jampanen was born in 1967 near New York in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumpernen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, a species such as Salbandy was not yet played at the SM level.
The telegram was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji hockey in the SM series, Jumppänen remembers.
Jampanen played the Salbandy SM series for the 1991-92 season in the club of the university, the following three seasons went on in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, with a balance accumulated in 169 games 51+34=85.
The most recent SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named for the national team
Josban of the Joensuu-based Salbandy club was raised by Perttu Puska and the uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki Round, the offensive 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's national games in which he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a femur and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 country games experience.
The national team was also named the pioneer player Mika Kohonen of the Seinäjoen Game Brothers, who was last seen in the Finland Shirt at last December's World Cup.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettunen, from Contiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing in the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volleyy Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in the series of both adults and young people.
In co-operation, the six best pairs of each series rankings are eligible for the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Volleyballists and the Finnish Volleyball Association.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki's YMCA, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven't played very often in adult leagues in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals around the corner, Hasu moods.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine in Elimäki's NMCA girls' E.
Top of the head is too big a jersey, knee guards on ankles, and huge ace screams and choreographs after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved - teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasuille beach volleyy was already a natural species choice during the junior era to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
Songs have been played on the beach in the arctic pond since the 1990s.
In recent times, activity has always been active.
I also went to the juniors' SM tour sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together in the weekend with the beat-down student Annina Parkkine at the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realist goal, we have a medal.
SM-Golden we're still missing in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toe slippers will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Solomon’s Koli courageously became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, sweat and vigour.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Kol, started working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went on to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out to be all right.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of a young food producer for Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.

The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
Compared with June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 as compared to December 2015 per cent) has been –0.2 per cent, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2 per cent.

Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers find it racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unportunityed, features-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, twisted teeth and turned the cheeks into chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered whether these recurring conflicts refer to the larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and were written about, among other things, on the website The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat reported that they removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not to the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some fiercely denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets of the pictures were widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds, "It is difficult to deny the parallel of a very tasteless Asian caricature to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only attempt to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic background than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things of this kind no longer go unnoticed as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who worked as a product manager and designer on the Medium publication platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published at Medium, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white-men-made leadership and ended his writing with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions of this kind, or they also have colored people as workers, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily" says the Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to its spokesperson, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congressional Expert Group, military officials falsified intelligence on ISIS
On Thursday, the Congressional Group of Experts published a report that officials on the US military, Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events in the field suggested.
Republican presidents of the United States House of Representatives Committee (House Armed Services Committee) Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defence Appropriations established a working group to report in an interim report on "general discontent" among military intelligence analysts. According to analysts, senior military authorities embellished their assessment of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the United States Armed Forces headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism activities than the facts in the field showed, and were invariably more positive than in the analysis of other units of the intelligence community," states a press release on the report.
"Centcom events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when high-level political leaders are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, California Republican Representative.
"Centcom executive errors extend to top level of organization".
The 10-page report details in detail the continuing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by Obama's administrative authorities have been falsified, it gives an impression of analysts that Centcom leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a large military assault to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015".
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of ISIS.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, U.S. Armed Forces' highest-ranking intelligence leaders manipulated intelligence results to minimize ISIS threat in Iraq".
The Republicans set up a working group after learning of the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more accurate results, as studies are still ongoing.
In addition, the Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process by which intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces was evaluated," says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking Democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence results, "infringing the morals of analysts" and "noting inadequately divergent views".
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "predicted or political official line".
The news site Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation into the Pentagon Superintendent, which was started as a result of lawsuits by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans says in his bulletin that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional Report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has further repercussions in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an argument made by more than one defence authority).
However, the allegations made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust Central Command and that it gives honest reviews of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence corresponds to the disagreements that arose over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite protests from many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Task Force concluded that despite opposing public statements, the air strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's field hockey and consolidates its position in a confrontation with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning, goalless 6–1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of the goals they've scored."
However, he knows this: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share their group's first place with Britain, who continued his winning streak while winning on Thursday with Japan's 2–0s.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final, which determines which of them will be the first and second of the six-team block.
The first-placed avoid facing the Dutch team considered hard for a longer time, who won the second block.
Despite what happens in Saturday's game, Americans have already made a fuss about their surprising success at these games, four years after it was last 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and first grabbed a field hockey bat at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played a sport in Drexel). He reached the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player of all time.
He missed the 2008 Olympic Games when he failed to make the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 races, where little success was seen from him and his team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've made a big turn."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the target game at the first half by hitting the ball near the back of the knuckle.
India had come to the game without any tournament win, but it proved surprisingly tough as an opponent and retained a 1–0 situation until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the field, writhed to the center field, hit the ball in the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2–0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal midway through the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament, in which US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, American goals had sunk each with one hit.
Briggs is now in his season of success,
As well as Bam.
"Our location is now good," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of Olympiahulina, the trampoline brings Zen
No matter where and when you go to the Olympics, you're bound to run into the Olympics.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions, and struggles seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming baton of communication, moving from archer to swimmer, from swimmer to gymnast, and from gymnast to triathlonist.
You cannot open television, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue of the cafe without avoiding hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley charms with his smile and might well have a name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong at the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in TV commercials of the good mind if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
Olympic fire does not elicit all competitions on an equal basis.
Far from the centre, in part in the shadow are lesser-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be territorial.
Although athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never reached the medals or progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the women's side the medallion has been taken by the Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend gold medals that they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognize in this context that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the never-ending bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jump, i.e. species that are essentially combined in the trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "a stepping board".
Ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds, and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged based on performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When reaching for gold, medal hopes must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical — and even enough to make a spectator tear.
But I also find this a little tiring just watching the games.
This is where the trampoline offers a breather.
In Trampoliin, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up as a weightless astronaut, falls down, and plunges back up effortlessly.
Of course, the sport also includes a competition perspective, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a intense rush into the goal or jumping far, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympic Games can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1.00 local time and men's matching races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, starting on each day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the midst of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might be overlooked in the midst of a general buzz.
And if awareness can only be enhanced by providing male athletes who appeal to viewing and objecting to them – as recently suggested by US male gymnasts Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new crowd of fans.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dismantled demonstrations demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Eyewitnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spreading to ever wider regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of the demonstrations presumably at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security forces beat with sticks young people who have been forced to stand with hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director for the International Crisis Group of the Africa Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if anything, receive this much help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from a model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the repressive policies of the regime, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are rapidly suppressed.
Many people have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and it has no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt out," says Seyoum Tehome, who works as a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
"All young people show their minds.
An entire generation protested."
There are many subjects for discontent, always from land use to government coalition strangulation from power.
After the election, which was widely criticised last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last place previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result they now dominate the whole of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing on the Eritrean border, where the aggravated situation required hundreds of casualties in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the chaos and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access the Internet through proxy servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas.
Oromot and Amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas from the predominantly Christian Highlands in Ethiopia have long dominated the country's politics and business and have robbed the Oros, much of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and nevertheless dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was especially skilled at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who reconciled between opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict scientist Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, entered Meles's boots from almost anonymity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the confidence of security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against elections, which, according to analysts, were first screwed up by the government and then stolen.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal grudge against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And a grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Amhara City Gondar, protesters attacked businesses owned by the tigres, and hate speech against the tigres is becoming widespread in social media.
According to analysts, protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The United States government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighbouring Somalia, but the base is, according to the United States, recently closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in the latest controversy facing his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions for the Republican side of the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in a awkward situation, who have to try to justify their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made a claim at an election event on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said in claiming that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
However, early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump rolled his speech in tweets completely the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was very serious about his accusations.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obamahan was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off his claim.
The most recent review storm rose as Trump attempted to focus his campaign back on the economy as the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy line speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He sees how supporters react to messages, and then "clarifies" in one way or another depending on reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are round enough to penetrate different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more in recent days as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist released on Friday reported that Trump's support is significantly smaller than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida has a tight level playing field.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the last months of his presidential campaign, ever more closely watched, Trump's jokes have placed his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they will have to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be a well-founded, political speech," answered Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called "the lower-series team" and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it failed to handle the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of condescending his speeches and discriminating attitude towards him.
He mocked the "indecent and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they cannot succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying that it only shows more clearly that he is not fit for president.
Due to an unreasonable increase in rent, the café quits at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly ragged cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash became a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but who offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside site on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
Locals find this loss of coffee shop, which has been evasive from middle classing, to be saddened.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York changes, I know, but I still can't believe there's no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, it's also creating a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and can be used to pay by credit card, but some employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee's still good, too.
The owner and chief of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, retained many things as they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon egg cheese-sandwiches available and capers and browned onion rings for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
There is no more beer at the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After holding the cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old regular customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited a cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Still after moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, then located in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he tells us that he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I thought I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work, and he always ordered the same.
"I walked into the cafe every day for over seven minutes, like a machine, and there they already prepared my butter bagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made with Verb's own cold-fried coffee.
"We may still take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles traditionally living in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafe with joy.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place for it so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the café's cold-fried coffee.
The cafe may also expand into the adjacent building.
However, for many customers it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like having arrived home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of coffee shop."
The dreary food of the Great Depression in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culin Cross, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the foie gras pasteur and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment house in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new co-work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and released on Tuesday, describing the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity in agreeing to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the major stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was well suited to the discussion on eating the Great Depression.
"The murders were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liverloaf, and bean loaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and rich.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they will be enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe is making fun of me.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the major years of recession, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you like".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is the chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to abandon their abundance.
"This was a time when food became an American central and distressing topic" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly distressing was the new affordable diet: Ziegelman said that enigmatic foods such as morsel and casseroles became the main food, and pot foods were said to be "a wonderful way to exploit food stars" because chefs could cover up not such attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The flesh, which had been the central part of the American meal for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values, rather than taste or even sound kitchen sense.
While doing research for the book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced oven bulbs filled with peanut butter used as a food for the time of shortage.
"It didn't get popularity at dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be meaningful budget holders and to meet the challenge of making fluffy foods like carrots and creamspaget.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical flavours.
Especially tasty are the reports of the reactions of the state administration to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on a Iowa farm, he himself ate, such as a millionaire and a sophisticated lord who had become him.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the foods served in the White House were not only Washington's dullest, but also the worst-produced."
Many of the food from the recession was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still evident in how we pay attention to calories and food supply and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple say that they began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once on wind hats".
After the main dishes were emptied at the lunch bar in Eisenberg, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they produced at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
We were reluctantly sinking our spoons into thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe dictated a second time and a third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
For Gilead, full compensation for legal fees for patent dispute over hepatitis C medicine with Merck
The U.S. Regional Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it received for the patent dispute with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc for the hepatitis C patent.
Gilead was acquitted in June for damages of $200 million for violating two patents owned by Merck in connection with successful medicines named Sovaldi and Harvoni in Gilead. An American judge found Merck committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an application registered on Thursday, U.S. Regional Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to a waiver from the legal fees it was entitled to in defence of the case.
Merck tries to achieve Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed the private ownership rights of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-sponsored forces have taken the city of Manbij from ISIS
The U.S.-backed forces have gained control of the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, reports a spokesperson for the troops.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) faction is now combing the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
A representative of the military council of Manbij, a member of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now fully in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return on Friday, indicating that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the real federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Foreign Minister, announced that he had earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing firm for his book on his tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10 years of tax returns.
The real federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a press release.
The perfect contrast is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
According to custom, the US presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, although the law does not require them to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have appealed for a tax government audit and call it the reason why Trump has not released his income data.
The "transfer is yours" was tweeted by Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
Thursday, Trump's Special Legal Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax information until the checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and released a video online on Friday, where he brings out prominent Republicans who press Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in her speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not his public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no taxes or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted on Friday several tax attorneys and auditors that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have risen to the central issue of the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire-investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, with the headquarters of the Berkshire Hathaway multi-business located in the same place, challenged Trump for meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet reports that he has also been audited by the tax government and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in the town of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the real federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income amounting to $109,000.

Chili powdered firecracker condoms to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Naturalists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements — elephants are harassed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, invented a few years ago, together with the American Nature Conservation organization, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to stir elephants.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen attitudes change in these villages, as now the villagers can count on them to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, in his press release.
First, the intruding elephant is alarmed by pointing a flashlight and ringing the horn.
If this does not work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
Grili powder mixed with dirt is placed in a condom together with a firecracker, and then the end of the condom is rotated so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads into the air a fine cloud of chili powder.
Usually one cloud of spice is enough to drive off an elephant.
The last way is to shoot a firecracker known as a Roman candle into the air and create a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from Arab "call" – RT News
A French, roots Jewish film director gave birth to media ravo after revealing that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention Israel's area code in its country code list. The hotel employee appealed to the "body" from Arab customers when asked.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On his recent visit, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in the area code list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's reply upset him.
The receptionist said that Israel's removal from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even further.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code."
The Israeli German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the incident was "a great shame".
"The incident upsets and upsets all of us.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is in view of the fact that we are in Germany and it is precisely this hotel chain that we are dealing with.
That's all the explanations you need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel simply succumbed to alleged claims from Arab customers.
The "disappear" was said in a batch of publication that highlighted the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel spokesman said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in a demonstration by Brazilian students
Students clashed with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riot began when law enforcement officials attempted to disband the student group, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at government plans.
The Governor of Sao Paulo State, Geraldo Alckmin, has put forward a proposal for a austerity measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed down and 300,000 students are placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti for walls temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, who held the presidency.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with excommunicated President Dilma Roussef for protesters in the country's Senate to vote on the impeachment charge in this regard.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Following the expatriation of sanctions, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says Russia's Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran granted Iranian citizens about 35,000 visas, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel in Russia for the first time in tourist numbers.
And it is not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner scored as the British won the gold of cycling
Scottish Callum Skinner contested the reputation in the men's teamprint on Rio's velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the 2012 title earned in London.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner played an anchor role that he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy, of Scotland. The youth proudly made the legend when he raced to the finish line and captured the victory from the New Zealand team considered a pre-favorite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth in the March London World Rally Championship, despite Hoy having since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was to replace Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was a man believed in by British coaches and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in the time run, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny pushed for the team's lead, which Skinner retained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the speed with a larger gear, allowing Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed from his seat as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he deliberately fell on the track due to a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and Britain's rivals had no appeal.
This time, there were no problems of this kind with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the UK flags were fluttering in the stands.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, five days of velodrom have been successful.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympic golds at one Olympic Games.
This would mean an increase in the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medalisations would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in a sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
The team race is always the best.
You'll enjoy the victory together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the knight's rank."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team-run.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) will be competed today on the second day of competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a dispute with the competition editors yesterday before the time run when the trustees invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milngavie, reached world record time 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its great track cycling team to take charge of the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
The expectations before Rio have been underestimated since the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton racing careers.
However, the competitions held on the first night on velodrome show that the already legendary reputation of Great Britain is once again being realised at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and hence the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company supplying the smelter to power plants told that one of the plant owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victorian government earlier this year not to continue to support the operation of the plant.
Fixed aid for 20 years will expire in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs are at risk of being lost from the Alcoa Portland plant.
As a result of the closures, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's smelter, which forced the Anglesea power plant to close last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other smelter owners will also close their contracts.
The factory is owned by a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shareholdings in the factory.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL reports that the contracts are so-called hedge agreements that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so they expire in 2017.
"As a result, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently constrained by strong future market prospects in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million "in anticipation of termination of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to abolish the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The American company reported that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was to enter into force as of November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the contract.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both a smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and a factory in Togo, near Newcastle.
AGL's operational director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts on an annual basis.
"If these plants exit the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand (electricity) in the market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians real television star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
A model belonging to the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared in Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover was released following a strange (or perhaps just the Kardashians series style?), a scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar jams Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashians program producer Ryan Seacrest), performing a forgotten cover of his sister. The video ends in a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and is used in almost every birthday episode of the degree shows (Sacrest utters the words, "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters into this publicity somehow.
For its appearance in the September issue of Vogue undoubtedly marks a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's lawsuit before (she appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite original.
September issue is Vogue's best-selling release per year.
A number that resembles a large picture book in its thickness more than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion website from Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of ads in last year's 832 page opus).
The release of the September issue's cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the previous two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has had celebrities working on the model rather than models that are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later was honored by Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of his generation, and even if he would rather be among the fames of the model's work, he is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called gifted women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to its reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have resurfaced as news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant complacency of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking through Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he shot for Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal Aid Centres turn 160 000 people away per year
Every year more than 160 000 most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts in appropriations will have on centres that are already at far-reaching borders.
In the state of Queensland, as many as three people are being turned away from five people seeking free legal aid and legal services – most of them elderly, immigrants, disadvantaged workers, victims of violence and unfounded evictions and similar injustices without resources fighting.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not spin its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland Public Legal Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, meaning thousands of people will be turned away when they apply for essential services," says Farrell.
"People leaving violent relationships, people under uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unduly laid off workers – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, meaning that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can obtain the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun
The New York: Donald Trump campaign was sued when no action of any kind was supposedly taken after its leadership was told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened the employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action filed by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor in the state campaign, on Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "picked up the pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the application, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it causes damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "proponents of another additional piece" – which are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media removed his words from the context and Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his action, Bordini claims compensation for the campaign's indifferent result and Phillip's compensation for assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call for Phillip's consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been engaged in a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was an issue that was most interested in Heathrow. As at the London Olympics in 2012, we invested enormously in the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the neighbouring areas of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who feel that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that in the eyes of the rest of the world we will find ourselves in an awkward situation.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
Overcoming obstacles are always met, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
This extension is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by £211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the environment of the airport and to the whole of the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in the budget, which included a T5 terminal – which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and a T2 terminal built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a £16 billion private investment.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in anti-advertising cat-mouse play
The efforts of companies that earn their money from online advertising to distract anti-advertise software have turned into cat-mouse play, says one company producing blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it would block advert programs, Adblock Plus released a blog post where it told users that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising entry codes on its desktop website so that it is harder to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he has deciphered the new codes.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of balling between the open source anti-advertising community and deceivers has been going on ever since the advertising block was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be making its own repair move again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisers have become in the industry.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising programs, reports a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily on mobile devices by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company plans to invest in distracting anti-advertising programs in its desktop app, as according to the spokesperson, mobile ads blocking programs do not work on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
Income from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
Tuesday Facebook also told us that it was updating the user settings advertising tool so that users can more control how to target ads on them.
Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock's new filters, as it also says they prevent some ordinary Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook's spokesperson in his email newsletter.
"Main suppression programs are clumsy and inefficient, and therefore we have invested instead in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertisements themselves."
A woman committed suicide by dropping herself under cars on a Swiss freeway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police ask eyewitnesses for help on the freeway in the first hours of Thursday for an accident in which a woman deliberately left herself under more cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud's canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate thing by lying down on the dark road, and was hit by more cars, says Vaud police in her press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear intention of committing suicide. Among the cars that overdrived, there was also a truck.
She died at the scene.
Police say that many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unrecognized. Police ask them or other eyewitnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges are being brought against motorists involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to find out," says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have taken place over the last five years, which exclude motorists from being held liable.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark freeway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was acquitted of the charge of manslaughter against him after he collided with a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one August night in 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the driving habits of the police — who were responding to an emergency call — were justified and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
On Thursday, anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus's past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions in Venus could sometimes have been similar to those on earth, although Venus is hot and anhydrous in surface and its atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to earlier presentations by researchers, Venus' slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the earth and has nevertheless been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"GISS's modeling is slow running and its daytime is almost two months at a time for the sun," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from solar heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to the earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Even though Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned vaporized water.
In hydrogen karate into space, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modeling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up his position as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the club's hockey activities, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Vice President/Chief Joe Sakic of Colorado confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey activities vigorously, passionately and resolutely," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"I have spent a long and earnest time thinking about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the club's Vice-President of hockey must be on the same lines as the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as Head Coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made the extension in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the 2015–2016 season and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card seat in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators say that the North Sea oil workers' pay strikes will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against the oil field service provider Wood Group with drilling rigs in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint declaration by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several day-long meetings over the next few weeks, dealing with the problems of recent aspects.
Trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts about 9% of the tariffs of its North Sea contractors this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with a 10% decrease in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the room necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to step up its operations with the British energy company BG Group after its mega-fusion.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK decision to leave the European Union in June will put pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with Labour Leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many and not few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared with around $7 billion spent on them in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejads' stellar corps
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rate of rotation of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of the Plejad stars so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbit times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between the weight and age of the star and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the University of Caltech, Pasadena, in a press release.
The Plejad constellation is located 445 light years from the earth.
Many of the stars of the constellation have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning that they are just reaching their adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever at the moment.
When the speed of rotation peaks, large amounts of star wind erupt from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they advance through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of identifiable starspots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that the larger stars rotate slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers – the larger spin slower than the smaller ones.
"We see from the "dance" of the Plejads that slow-rolling are typically larger, while the fastest-rolling are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Being so close, the Plejad constellation serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star characteristics in relation to rotational speeds.
"The Plejads Star Corps offers a supporting pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to know a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of the Plejads in their three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal periodical.
