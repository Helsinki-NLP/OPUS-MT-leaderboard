Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing person report on a boy who left West Tampere with his friend has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Night-Says at midnight, knowing that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the after-party.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father told me.
Ronaldo, on the ferocious side, tore a goal gap with Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing also in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid went to the top of all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network with two hits of penalty kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when, before Tuesday, Barcelona Messi, who was equalising with him, has a size of 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League's Pool D it started strongly with a 2-1 guest win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of a knee-difficulty Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's major league game, did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced hard times in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's guest match only lasted 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking slide tackle of PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU pack that attacked the goal so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break in extra time.
The PSV winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The goalmaking season in the Champions League began with Paris Saint-Germain of Pool A.
It was Angel Di Maria, who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG-tuttu, from Argentine.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
The PSG has been placed among the season's successes.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, TsSKA, lost a B block in a match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately demanded resignation - the president made the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
Mugabe apparently did not realize the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party MDC called on Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only occurred at Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional EU leaders' summit next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively those who come to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Home Ministers.
Professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked in an emergency call for a voice slightly shaking the police at his home and told him that he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared, and the professor told me that the contact information for the dead woman's family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white document paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb's letter read according to the authorities.
There were no indications that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometres to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history who was dead at the door of his office, who is believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, Police Chief of Delta State University, stated that the university's authority was informed of the shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
One more death could fit into the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind a few locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive.
Scholars explained details in both localities, and those who knew Lamb told of the man. A picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher was born for the researchers.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to Gautier police at Prentiss's death location, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in his book, which had given recognition to "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to lead an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, references to problems arose.
A student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014–2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay policy meant that the dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of associate professor.
University principal William LaForge reported that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson reported.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson told them that he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began work as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He received a PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest-serving friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was herself 15 and Lamb 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar for years.
"Lamb was then quite a heartbreaker.
All the girls were at his place," said Hairston, now 40 years old and lives in Jackson suburb Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said that he killed his wife, but no records show that they were not married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and lived in a brick house in a river estuary in the small town of Gautier.
Police say the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that he had resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends and have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was absolutely shocked," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Girl and Mother Were Best Friends".
O'Steen had not met Lamb but had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, reported seeing Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
There was nothing to tell me that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his urn, directed first-year seminars and was specialized in Indian and colonial history," English professor Don Allan Mitchell reported.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and Student Union.
On Delta State University campus, Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered for a memorial service in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a night-night event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"Crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster Pettus in Mississippi's Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as the police now tell us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also clarified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in an emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
The Toys R Us company does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the distributor of toys and baby products tells us that he offers his current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity for additional hours of work.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start in October–December.
Although it is still months away from the holiday season, the business season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workers in stores, as well as delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive, and I noticed there was an empty place beside me, and it dawned on me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me she was coming to the trailer for the Back in Time documentary.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time documentary is related to Return to the Future films, and the documentary interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg in addition to Fox.
Back to the Future movie premiered 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely an all-time time travel film for me," Spielberg stated.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format, and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to almost five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to join forces and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be scheduled for the UN General Assembly ministerial week later this month.
Mr Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation that could not be resolved.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iran Nuclear Treaty.
Chapters 8 of the support polls: Is Donald Trump serious?
There's been an attempt to label Trump as an idler.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
In Republican circles (so far) every effort has been made to pull Trump out of the poll lead.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump two-digit support figures. Some are already seriously considering what it basically says about the nominations for the real estate mogul.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected as a Republican candidate.
Experts remind you that Rick Perry, who was in the poll tip at this time in 2011, was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither finally won the candidate election in any state.
Trump would, for many reasons, have a hard time in the general election.
External factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC as well as the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and began to dig to bring him down.
The following recent poll data indicate that the property mogul cannot be ignored by shoulder-crowding:
There's been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would stand as a candidate in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University poll, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also hold in the states where the elections are held first.
In the Quinnipiac poll last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of Republicans would welcome Trump's nomination.
In the CNN and ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans stated that they were very pleased or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40 percent with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding support rate of 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temper is problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompousness and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters throughout the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul suitable for the president.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: according to Quinnipiac Gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities suitable for the Chief of Defense.
However, according to the ABC and Post poll, 44 percent feel Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temper incompatible with the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to the CNN and the ORC poll, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal in the past.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans support another candidate, Trump beats almost all the other candidates.
Some experts consider that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents split into supporters of different candidates.
An opinion poll by Monmouth University at the beginning of September revealed that in a fictional double struggle between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would get a larger support force on his side almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
Ted Cruz and he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the victory over Trump by 19 points in a fictitious double struggle.
A narrow majority of Trump's supporters say they have already taken a vote.
According to a poll released on Tuesday by CBS and NYT, just over half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote decision.
The situation may change for a number of reasons, of course, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's hardest contestant at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Following Donald Trump's campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches banish important Latin American voters from Republican troops and hinder the brand's renewal.
However, according to the polls released on Monday, ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on the same lines as Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently collect about half of the Republican votes. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have run as outsiders.
The Republican forces want a fresh face instead of a political champion. According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
The two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to an opinion poll conducted by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent on the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut in Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
The Labour Party's new forward image Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to rise for the first time to reflect his strength in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn asks the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party are following him hard.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can miss some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In the encounter, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the context of a parliamentary test now following the gathering of a shadow government and a speech by Corbyn's Confederation of Trade Unions at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to remain silent during the National Anthem at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been criticized by several representatives of the Tory Party. The silence has also ended up in the headlines on the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman stated that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, respecting in silence the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite the anti-monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to party leadership.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant considers that political disagreements over UK membership of the EU and the conditions for granting government-enlarged benefits have piled up in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn stated that Labour intends to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the shadow government's Minister for Labour and Pensions, Smith, stated that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader to be faced by David Cameron during the past decade in charge of the Tory Party.
The Labour Director who promised a new approach to politics says that he has chosen to ask Cameron questions about his 30,000 proposals from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North constituency, there are too many clashes in Question Time, and he promises to avoid clever lyricism and loan throwing and says that he is instead focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that shadow minister Angela Eagle is covering her in Question Hours, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corbyn has also thrown out the idea that others can also get out at times, saying that he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
After Corbyn took the leadership of the party in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet theatre-like policy, often associated with Question Time. However, some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the first televised in 1990, Question Time has been considered a key indicator of the director's judgment, control of the House of Commons and position. However, critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs extensive reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young people to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way of learning and making money has been found for the group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home area and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has graduated through the project among the first.

The pound is getting stronger as British wages rise
The pound was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year. No bonuses were included.
The faster growth than predicted was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1% and its exchange rate was quoted at $1,5505. The pound also strengthened in relation to the euro, and was quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was pained by 20 per cent when the company received a preliminary bid from the rival company AB InBev.
When implemented, the store would unite the world's two largest brewing companies and bring under the same roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the positive results of the rival Richemont Group, which focused on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. The development of sales was also a consequence of an upward trend in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent after the miner announced its intention to raise $2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest falls with a drop of 4.3% when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale.
The JD Sports rate rose by 3.1% after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would rise by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage spending could hinder expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Management Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grassroots campaign against Aldi's avalanche
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from the Aldi takeover in southern and western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and Western Australia against Aldi's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand with marketing in mainstream media and social media as well as organizing events like Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the Ice Cream Factory Simmo, located in Dunsborough, offers tastings in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to regular customers for the South Australian Football League games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and hardware wholesale will organise the annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, as South and West Australia account for almost 30 % of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than that of the IGA retail network in the eastern Länder.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their cornerage, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a 30% market share and Western Australia has a 24% share, while eastern states account for only 14%.
For example, analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi captures 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain feeds on sales from all operators, but especially from operators independent of chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA traders could come to the sale of 360 million and Metcash could be a $250 million notch by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in sales in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan shows that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he considered it very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public stand on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA has fallen from 18% in 2010 to 14%, and the result of the Metcash food business serving 1200 IGA dealers has fallen by 43 per cent from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of over $150 million in Australia to meet Coles and Woolworths' prices for hundreds of products every week. The chain wants to support traders in renovating stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the range of food for their own brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price revision and store reform plans are well under way, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian tennis union president Steve Healy defends Thanasi from Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Australian tennis union president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim in a recent Nick Kyrgios-related joint. Kokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
The younger side of the duo named the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was put in an unfavorable spotlight when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to twice separate the rivals from each other. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison stated.
In the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis, frustratedly struck the bat field when powerful cramps ruined his fights. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
Currently, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for a single-player second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the controversy," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the U.S. Open. He is by no means the first player to break his bat due to frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well for example Harrison's provocative conduct in the U.S. Opens, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard and completes the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He practices hard, is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on the basis of his own merites."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important round starting as a Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra's educator to long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on matches instead of the polemic related to Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top fast. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of public opinion. He deserves criticism for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to make peace with him. I believe that it is best for both the team and Nick."
The European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern borders from the direction of Serbia on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants to prevent the influx of migrants.
There was chaos on the border as hundreds of immigrants piled up in a non-man's country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain on the road between checkpoints of countries in their tents for an indefinite period of time
Frustration began to surface.
As the police helicopter was flying in the air above the immigrants, they kept saying, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protesters on the food and drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it would not accept that migrants should be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels in the next few days, and also in other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The boom on the Hungarian-Serbia border began a day later when a group of 28 states failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that responsibility for the 40 000 floods of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with the hope that by next month or the end of the year agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 immigrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the immigrant crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for immediate action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency developed so that in the two southern regions, the authorities were allowed to adopt more effective measures, i.e. to close you down and speed up legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the influx of migrants from that direction, now that there is already a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for finishing barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point to the European Union for migrants, many of whom are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are living standards refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek refuge, a view which is radically different from those of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-meter-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and to determine longer prison times for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government declares a crisis state in the country," Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told reporters in the town of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime".
In practice, Parliament still has to accept military action, which is expected next week, and journalists from the Associated Press news agency at the border have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and their military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, an internal security advisor for Orban, reported that authorities have caught 45 attempts to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By damaging the fence, people who have crossed the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday, a border crossing point being closed by a train wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a contact point in a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a food and drink strike until they were allowed to go to Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton leadership over Bernie Sanders reduced by half by national poll
The support rate for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still two-digit in the race as Democratic National Presidential nominee, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached the distance.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of Democratic supporters' votes (decrease from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% support (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure for the presidential race, whose support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for the majority of Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more confident of their choice than the other candidates.
Since the poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for several groups of Democrats, while new supporters have joined Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong lead among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly and has only a 5% bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost his headship among under 50-year-old Democrats, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in support hits against Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken a five percentage point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A fourth would support Clinton with minor reservations, and 15% would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more fragmentation in views among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
Forty-eight percent of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 percent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are asked freely to describe why they support his nomination, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to select a female president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are references to a common set of views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The vice president is still weighing his possible nomination, and 57% of the Democrat voters would like him to go to the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the Democratic electorate is asked for the second most popular candidate as a party candidate, the majority choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, over half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase its head start over Sanders. With Sanders involved, the head start is 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not enter the race.
55% of the Democratic electorate sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
The number two Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual election.
Democratic voters, however, attach greater importance to views on issues of substance than to candidates' chances of winning.
Voters do not consider any Democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are honest, reliable, and leader types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered a type of leader.
As many as 30% of Democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15% of Sanders does. 27% cannot say if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters feel that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the electorate's own ideology.
For all features, about a quarter do not have an opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and her own server as foreign minister, the majority of Democrat voters say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed the perception of these voters about Clinton.
The Americans, more widely, disagree.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
The opinion of the people was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
A majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall view of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although voters of their own party consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when asking for the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32 per cent honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not consider Clinton honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the poll, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be the most reliable.
The majority consider Sanders to be honest, but as with Carson, many do not have an opinion on Sanders.
The sample of the questionnaire is 351 voters, with a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson grabs Donald Trump's head start in a national support poll
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest poll of support, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took over half of the votes in the new poll, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters throughout the country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey conducted prior to last month's debate. According to a poll released on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would be a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support for all population groups, and in a group of college graduates, he narrowly beats Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida split third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voters' sample is 6 per cent in one direction or another. The survey was conducted in September.
According to CNN and ORC's latest survey, last week, Carson's support is rising, supported by 19% of Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
Also in ABC News and Washington Post's latest poll, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In the men's encounter last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump stated Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in the parish ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
Members of Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Ps's fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a christening held in September 2013. According to the police, the county did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, a backpack filled with sand weighing almost 15 kg had been put on his back and repeatedly attacked as he attempted to reach a target located across an ice field.
Deng is reported to have first complained about headaches and then lost consciousness.
Police say that the members of the Pi Delta Ps frat didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told at a press conference that members, however, had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the chairman of the county, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began hiding equipment, putting the benefit of the county ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner stated.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been struck several times in the head, upper body, and thighs with blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the co-op's chimp, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the chimp since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The partners and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Monroe County Grand Jury presented five members of the frat to be charged with murder in the third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the frats are charged with bullying and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to take responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or unofficially accepted the plague," Wagner reported at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College placed the frat's operating ban on operations, and the national fraternity resigned from the activities of the local department.
This is how the interest rate increase of the Federal Reserve (Fedin) will affect
Interest rate increases and the boom in the stock market fade, return on securities rises and the economy slides into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially with regard to the economy, we find a historical reference to timing.
The recession has arrived in up to 11 months since the first increase in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, although not always. The key factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why Central Bank officials have already been very anxious to see that investors are not paying attention to the fact that interest rates start to rise, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market players may find that any fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, a chief global economicist of Capital Economics told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level; it is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, it does not mean that there are no effects.
Here, based on historical trends, examples of how impacts can be reflected in different economic sectors:
As has already been seen in the market for about a month, the premonition of interest rates can increase instability for a time.
When the interest rates finally rise, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be a halting of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12–24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank's analyst noted in a recent study of the consequences of interest rate increases.
As revised over the 35 years, the market usually sees a sharp rise at the time of the rise in interest rates, about 14%, fairly steady for the next 250 days (mean increase 2.6%), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average return on interest after six stock exchanges is 14.4%, reports Bob Doll, chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is usually slightly higher at a later stage of the cycle and interest income is beginning to decrease.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works.
In this case, if a central bank encounters conditions that did not exist in the past and could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 increase rates since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015 seems 3.6%, many did not think it would last, and in the third quarter is 1.5%, says the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a delicate economic situation, there may be a risk and one might ask whether this situation is different," Deutsche said.
In the market, operators have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and the eyes turn to the meeting of this week's Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, the futures trade shows only a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles up to this day have been in a supercycle, where GDP before the downturn is also rising very rapidly since the boom began," the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the Central Bank has expected since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is already going for the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable on the market before interest rate withdrawal, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
"The underlying difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change direction as soon as the first up/down cycle begins.
At the end of the rise cycle, profits will immediately fall," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and smooth the curve.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," Schwab's fixed-income securities analyst Kathy Jones said.
Interestingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of Dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly on the US market benefit because interest rates are falling and local products are becoming attractive.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the strengthening dollar causes their products to tilt on the global market and debt to rise.
"History shows that quality shares will be more profitable over the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet beat weak balance sheet enterprises by an average of five percentage points after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Non-financial corporations with high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better than the lower-quality ones, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"The debt is a big question.
Companies that have a significant share of floating rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers will generally also benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
The savers also benefit from higher returns, although the experts are divided on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for too much popularization.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to separate from its commercial rival.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards only as a copy of the Brits gala.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of the Classic FM channel, adding pressure to the station to prove that it offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and the channel is hardly separated from its commercial rival anymore.
"I hate to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM channel," Bingham stated.
The BBC Music Awards held last December also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, organized for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples that instead of new and different, we are simply mimicking what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers considerably more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," the Director-General said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey stated that the station needs to work harder to keep the public interested, as the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one to enter the territory of commercial channels with criticism from the BBC channel, in consultation with the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory Party parliamentarian Damien Collins criticized The Voice talent search competition, which the BBC purchased from Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the deal is estimated at £22 million.
"The program is not much discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1 as star judges by Paloma Faith and Boy George was produced in a typical way for the BBC.
In addition, Collins insisted that the company look for a hit show in its own garage when it next launches a new series of entertainment.
However, Collins refused to exclude the fact that the The Voice series would continue to be commissioned or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest e-commerce growth ever in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchasing.
Experts believe that the Black Friday of November can curb the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the conquest of the online store has devastated many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when the sales of e-commerce have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it is clear that the growth will stabilise over time," IMRG editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile purchasing.
"With it, more and more were able to buy online, and buying for many was possible in a different environment, for example from a home couch.
As mobile purchasing is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday, from America, is a phenomenon that is considered one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the theme day on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online buyers compared to normal caused many traders' websites to fall.
Experts believe that black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd in after offers, can curb buying desires in the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for each of the five pounds was consumed online.
Over one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
The Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden's family in charge
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral takes place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, Saudi Binladin Group, a large construction company, is involved in an accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured following the crash of the crane.
Bodies were carried high in the air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of Mecca's Greater Mosque
A crowd of people dressed in white had gathered on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The grief convoy traveled to a pilgrimage site where the fallen building crane had only one day before invaded the mosque's roof on Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia claims responsibility for Bin Laden's construction family business for an accident in which 394 people were injured in addition.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in the Mecca Great Mosque crash were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were starting their annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to an Arabic press release, Binladin Group is complicit in the accident.
The news agency’s English service did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the Group’s management has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a press release on the crash and the Group's representatives have not been reached for the opinion.
The King also accused the Group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekka's Grand Mosquey as part of Binladin Group's giant construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close ties to the Saudi family of rulers, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
The crash in heavy rain and hard wind occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (about EUR 250 000) to the families of the victims and those permanently disabled.
Other persons injured in an accident receive half of the compensation.
According to B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon
The British hire more and more household generals, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, professional workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, principal correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting jobs to workers from Eastern Europe.
The art of hammering and painting seems to be few these days.
Today, the British are hiring more and more household generals to handle home humping, reports the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO in Kingfisher, who owns a store chain of home renovation supplies. According to Laury, professional workers arriving from Eastern Europe are behind the phenomenon, offering services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores aimed at traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labor in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, it is worth noting population trends, as more and more women living alone now are also renovating their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are in the tail of companies belonging to the British FTSE 100 index and has also reorganized the company's management team so that there are equal number of male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of his kind, as 50 per cent of its staff are women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board".
The Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures show a decrease, although the company worked hard after the closure of stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to force right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad employee protest.
There's a lot of people who think there's reason there, too.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to take part in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few ten thousand people, millions of professional organisations, does not give much thought.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was a few decades ago.
Not everyone knows the aims of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of Ay movement's operations, the harsh solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, the union finally brings the matter, that is to say, the rights of the worker, to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to detain the role of the ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
No matter what you think of the activities of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's head.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Towards a saving of 8.5 million, reducing staff by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology begins a austerity course aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on all personnel with a saving target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates that the actual activity will be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by cuts in appropriations made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research, as well as a reduction in corporate funding, on our university is very significant," says Principal Anneli Pauli in the University Bulletin.
Before the summer, the impact of cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding now appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with trustees will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
The owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to gradually open up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is in turn.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
US central bank interest rate decision time
The whole world is following the meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Wednesday and Thursday, where a possible increase in interest rates will be decided for the first time in almost a decade.
More than half of the economists, who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25%, as shown by a survey conducted by the 80 economists of Reuters.
"This is a historical situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest at zero for seven years.
For the first time we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate the normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought billions of extra dollars into the balance sheet and has stimulated little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20.00 Central European Time.
Delta State University shooter left an apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before a colleague was shot later that day – Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, officials reported on Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science in Gautier, Mississippi, called the emergency number at around 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a person.
Lamb made an emergency call and asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that is no trouble to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell me the motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, as well as a handwritten note written by Lamb saying, "I am very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometres away to Delta State University, where he killed the history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his life late on Monday when the police reached him.
University principal William LaForge reported that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt as well. However, authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangular drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
The man said the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles reported that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles stated that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them he was not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dim Stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is annoyed to stay on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the fields this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in a poor tackle by Héctor Moreno in the PSV defensive area when the game was running for fifteen minutes.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to a hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal stated.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
A youth who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now injured after a great amount of gambling.
In the costume booth, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when my leg breaks in two places, he'll be out of the way for half a month and he won't play in the block stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten away with it when the situation did not follow a red card penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli of the match didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can conclude for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't say how devastated I am.
More about: Manchester United's Luke Shaw aside in PSV match
The English defender has a particular reason to recover to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," stated PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing for Mexico with the Netherlands piloted by Van Gaal only at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very sorry, because his intention was not to harm the opponent. I'm sorry to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno stated on SBS6.
"I feel really bad, I'm very sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, each parent discovers that the child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for what you see, David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the prime minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story of Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there's always a picture or a message we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron is to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to complete the short initial text.
"In the city of Tarville, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is merchandise, there is a boy named Ted who wants to enter the heart of his dream girl Audrey by implementing this biggest dream: to see the real tree," the text says. In the 1991 dead Dr. Seuss or Theodor Seuss Geisel version, Ted had no object of fascination.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and manufactures accessories from them despite the resistance of the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, mustached creature that protects forests.
Likely, a public relations mission such as this, of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child,
The Prime Minister's representative reported that the text probably originated from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the England team, but it's still tough.
The encounter with Pakistan in the combined Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the defeat of the last 3-0 Test series by the team chosen for the tour of England, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they do not have bad experiences from 2012, with only youthful positiveness.
As a ball player, Moe's Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test level experience, represents the offensive option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks under challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long a Test batter gets the opportunity to impress is difficult.
Lyth had seven ground matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
The only thing to complain about is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in peak condition – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes on the team and he's a hitter I appreciate high.
He is a cricketer of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this obviously depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start batting with Cook, which will get an extra curve pitcher into the game while four fast pitchers are being held, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see the obstacle that a top pitcher could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricketer.
Moe may not have achieved much for his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that is not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player before being able to start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no going back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup thread pitcher, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher – and this may be a long shot, but not many curve pitchers have shown themselves to be ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England appears to have made a couple of intelligent selections for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawarde, as an advisor to Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the sport, bringing with it much experience because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball section of the game trip and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always seemed to fit into international cricket, whether his role is a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, may be a stimulant.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day matches, Root had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not set the match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape 2017
David Cameron's semi-needed renegotiation strategy for Britain's retention in the EU is day by day deeper in the swamp, even without pleasing Jeremy "yes or no" Corbyniak's election to the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC mocking Europe fiercely on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wreaking about – even though not everyone is an act of their own – and some Member States are tired of Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes dissensional concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, at the annual TUC Congress, it was decided that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it were to undermine social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catch a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking persons, return home and say they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin and suggests that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and civil servants in the various capitals have reached the point where they no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or successor selection in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them running to help the selfie British who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want that either, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some such ministers may plan to deliberately throw useless comments like the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK People's Election Campaign to speed up Brexit's process, my friend suggests.
"Reconferencing was an organized case". "British left nothing in hand for renegotiations".
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, the result of which advocated 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remotely remembers Boris Johnson, a sleek Euro-opportunist who became known as our "EU direct banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax evasion, telephone hacks and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a diversion so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even the most blairist in his opposition to the referendum, as Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the referendum 2005, Blair was easily off the hook.
The press never forgave him, either.
But nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me, and there may be a risk that he'll introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory can probably answer yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but Bennitit" Benn told on radio and television this week when her inner boy scout tried not to admit it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had trouble being disloyal to his Labour colleagues on television without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU "under all circumstances". McDonnel did not say so to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
Corby wanted to pass on any savory picture, we must remember that he even touched me. Communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are pulverizing.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn's evivocation of EU membership fits into the Bennite blockade economy and the anti-capitalist past. The discussions no longer belong to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents to whom the idea of similarity unites is a central doctrine in the doctrineal struggles.
There has also been an outbreak in NATO, and Tom Watson is unflinching in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their countries of origin.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters; why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the cuts in the Tory government, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticised the British authority's statements on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government-funded agency that the smoking of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than conventional smoking arose at a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented by the Public Health England (PHE) on electronic cigarettes in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal.
The PHE described its report last month as "a forward-looking and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and have highlighted the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial by Lancet Medical Journal last month, the teeth were taken on a "substantially light foundation" on which the chief conclusion of the PHE is based.
In addition, two researchers have wondered in the BMW whether the claims have been established on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that the claim of the PHE that "currently best estimate e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which sought to harmonise participants' views on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results were compiled in the study.
According to McKee and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, the President and CEO showed support in the Sustainability Report for the activities of BAT in the field of public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from an electric cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from tobacco company Philip Morris International did not.
There is no explanation of the criteria for selecting the panel configuration, but there are a number of well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom admit their involvement as an industrial financier.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Officer.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no conclusive evidence of the harmfulness of the products with regard to a large part of the products and their compliance with the criteria.
However, no links or shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been provided that electronic cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, the allegations have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than conventional smoking.
One in two people who smoke throughout their lives die because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be examined further.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80 000 deaths per year related to smoking, and smoking costs the public health sector £2 billion per year.
Responsible action requires us to clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but their harmful effects are a fraction of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial rivals would give their right hand to hit shows, such as the soap opera Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other television stations.
He criticizes the presentation of programmes likely to reach a smaller audience than the BBC, at the same time as the big ratings programs of competitors, as well as on BBC4 for example.
After BBC executive director Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to get Channel 4 to collaborate with the BBC for six years, unsuccessfully.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programs that are clearly part of the software of some competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords' Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its offer to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC broadcasts The Voice for Best Viewing because it wants as broad a support as possible in the future.
If no other channel takes the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is own production.
A lot of channels would give you their right hand on it.
I do not understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. In his view, the BBC is challenging good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are in line with the former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out shows like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's Niche audience programs are shown on BBC4, where viewer numbers are most often not measurable, but the programs fulfill their purpose. "BBC can say, while defending its hypocritical missions, that £4 billion broadcasts did make special programs that no one watched."
"BBC presents them at times when no one ever sees them".
On radio charges, Johnson stated, "I challenge you to find another system in the same old-fashioned sense that who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is advantageous, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if the BBC is not watched much."
Former director of Sky and Channel 5 channels David Elstein, who also gave his own views in committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should exchange his ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programs in BBC's current offer – 1 percent on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change its mission to a new faith: "information, lighting and entertainment".
On the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts to events such as Proms Festival, which was broadcast only a fraction of the concerts last year. "BBC should also join the Alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offering available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttleworm changes direction when ultrasonic is applied.
Scientists have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle worms switch in their direction when ultrasonic is applied to them, the frequency of which is above the auditory range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified with a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More about: Researchers monitor brain activity by light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). In the method, ultrasound is utilized to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Shuttle depressions normally do not respond to ultrasound. However, Chalasani noticed that worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles intensify ultrasound waves that advance inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels found in some of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control nematode worms with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that I know how to control their motion, TRP4 ion channels appeared.
When ultrasonics were controlled on modified worms, microbubbles reinforced sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal to move in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows scientists to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is applied to the brain under investigation by optical fibers, but low-frequency ultrasounds can easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be momentarily exposed to ultrasound signals in clinical environments in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani stated.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin producing cells.
Illegal Torture Equipment — At Your Home Door!
Advertising is a disgrace to British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-armament fair video.
Horrible killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leghold traps!
Grape bombs!
Telebumpers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the efforts of the British government to sell weapons to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) exhibition held at the ExCel Exhibition in Docklands, London.
More about: DSEI Station Fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway cars that require another glance.
"Strategic Announcement: Do you take the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement resembles the London Metro announcements in appearance. There is a picture of a tanker at the end of the metro line on the other side.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive at Docklands, and customers will be asked to help to close the arms fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were featured at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London with a £6 "advertising space hacking package" with six-hole keys that allegedly access about a third of the world's bus stops advertising poster stands.
Transport for London is not funny about poster vandalism.
One of the prank ads of the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work to the public to see outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires art to be brought into the real world. Many people are moving to work with protest movement activists.
One of the anti-gun posters greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both graphic designer and narrator have also done their work without compensation.
The VCCP artistic director Matt Lever shrugged at the absence and empty passage of fair advertising in the ExCeL event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, obscure corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring up a fair where there is illegal trafficking in torture equipment," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded right at our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative contribution of the Armoured Fair is displayed in the exhibition rooms themselves in ExCeL, where exhibitors take advantage of spectacular euphemisms of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the United States Army concerning "the portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specialized warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
Doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dorms
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago, and I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in berets and moral relativism.
The main lessons I can sum up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory is the most stressful experience and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to talk about it: tell everyone where you are, tell everyone if you took a year off and why, what you like Corbyn and why you don't "truly hate or love Marmite, because that's just yeast extract, hahhahahaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to breathe: show interest and ask others questions.
Questioning will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your rips were on fire and these people would share extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
My own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but your own room is also a place to dress, from undergarments.
More about: Don't even think of combining dating and university studies
For Introverts, the university is a hard place
However, many dormitories form a social culture in which to wander from one room to another and to form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
It is not possible to say in this environment, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to date you."
Try to see if one of your college friends is exhausted from social interaction, and perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student dorm who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little weird case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you about personalities."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and thanks to a tasty surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakerial skills from you.
If you serve unhappy flour, sugar, and grease-cooked clumps, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offence in student dorms.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but is it allowed to pour a drop of someone else's milk can?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get permission, even if you borrow milk from the owner of a can.
I understand that it is annoying if someone steals something from you. However, try to handle the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own collegemate who loitered detergent in his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make noise when others try to sleep or study.
Not only is it polite, but it is also worth remembering that every other person digs a hole...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the person in the next room to turn the music down, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally slowed down, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours for her exam, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought that your college friend was your future spouse, started dating, divorced, and had to see him every day, and lost the right to meet your mutual friends?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if the college guy is definitely not the only one who is right, try to control his desire.
If you find at a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the boundary between prank and bullying is more subtle than one might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you can recover from in no time.
Hiding an object may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door of another room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don’t put anyone’s things on the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple more times.
A racist attack on a foreign student's lodging in Kite - A house designed as a reception center was dented in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on the residence of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical People's College at Kite.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodation facilities were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation room, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher of the youth guarantee training at the People's College, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"There was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," Luke says.
The People's College accommodates people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland investigate the attack as an act of damage and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, an information conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," says Lukeka.
According to the reading, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators were suspected to have been at least three men and had been on the way to a light passenger car.
I think this is a young people's weekend whim now that this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo that has been maimed with a reception center.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on the MTV website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report from the police.
Specification 15 September at 16:02 Corrected for incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of people living in the building.
The government's going to shut down the Y train to Karjaa... with the passengers on their hands, "just idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karelia stops running in March.
The news annoyed passengers rising to the evening shift of the train at the Helsinki Main Railway Station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntians," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is constantly increasing and people in work need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video he will come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains running on the main track are combined into a new R-line.
Purola Station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are left out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR released information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the following contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström of Siuntio considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes regret.
The Y train is also used by others than the Raseporians and the Siunthians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry, from Espoo, was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It is especially bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said when he was on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
A new train connection to the beach line is likely to replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. to take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, in practice, the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Savi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi reports that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million dollars a year for the Y train, the ministry, of course, much more than this.
The R line on the main track skips two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Sauna Rock, the number of train shifts doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seenäjoki.
Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts are reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made on end-of-life shifts, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring to the State annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Timeliness book: "It's a good idea to get to know Marx"
The crises in the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his principal work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakane, known as the former Chairman of the SVP, in Marx Capital's book today.
"He is now being taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy into all areas of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of financial capital and imaginary capital have proven to be astonishingly farsighted.
The book's authors list, based on the Capital Seminars organized by Hakase, also includes Aalto University's professor, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
But the former CEO of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman tells on the phone that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary expert.
"The usual view is that the history of ideas tells of the false opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman, however, sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The most important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, Marx's interests are being discussed, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be brought to an end.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoist and Trotskyans and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as well as other classics," says Korkman.
UN demands war criminals for conviction in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, reports AFP.
The UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan Armed Forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Even the number of victims is not accurate.
In particular, the major military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be investigated properly, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combat.
Both sides have reportedly committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court, as foreign judges.
The English Yo test allowed social media to be considered
The autumn matriculation writings had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a paper on social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250 word writing could address an online magazine's advisory column to the administrator.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He was to be consulted on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of substance, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third topic, English lecturer Mia Lybeck, of Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third subject was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, according to Lybeck, was all right.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and rated the whole experiment as "pretty normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that addressed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn writings continue on Friday, when the second domestic test, Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is normally arranged, so it is not affected by the employee's demonstration.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the trainees to find suitable transport connections in time for them to arrive at the trial.
You can get extra time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A store was robbed in Oulu at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in the Kello district on Wednesday morning in Oulu.
Police say the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering combopo.
He's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money as his prey.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's decision to cut will block the Helsinki city centre on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary reports, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK alliances meet at the Railway Market at 11.
Police are also believed to participate in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the police in work are responsible not only for carrying out the alarm missions and other police activities, but also for ensuring that the giant demonstration is carried out.
Roads to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9.30 to 14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisanniemi roundabout, from the west direction since Mannerheimintie.
Do you have enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
For the time being, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on a cop's industrial battles.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland because of the demonstration.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
"Something is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police urge you to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic dump extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until early in the evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be allowed on the Railway Market.
As a rule, buses remain at a distance.
The rest of the journey must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the smooth flow of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with in part by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
After all, people are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in various parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not have a very good benchmark in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siiäinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Soviet.
The very right-wing government has hit the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also those that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The hard grips of the government are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here about the fact that the ay movement is actually being tried to get to its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the ay movement does not by any means have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the protest will bring about in the group that the ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
Unemployed persons from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a 1993 Murrostorstai, says Siivainen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (center) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employee organizations had never been as bad before as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the ay movement is perhaps even worse than in the time of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the very bourgeois government of Finland is now in power, says Siiäinen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict on the right, despite the speeches made by the Finns.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes kindergartens and schools.
While the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the largest in years.
Approximately 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish ay protests have been quite peaceful - even though policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
The protesters are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property," says Siiäinen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firefighters lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike of metalmen.
The strike was suspended by a settlement commission motion after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metalmen received a 16% raise in pay.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people, many of them made unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliament House to express their opinion in favour of the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The strike of firefighters was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in an egg rain when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, EU quits", was one of the slogans.
To Espa, the farmers fell a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened by strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass secession ultimately accelerated the negotiations to the end.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of strikers in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and caused a lively discussion on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament House in 2013.
Central Crime Police investigates the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have requested the assistance of the Central Criminal Police in the investigation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the truck were all in good shape.
We have had exchanges of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to the first public radio report on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among others, and its CEO is a man with foreign background, about 40 years of age.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain who beats refugees, a former drug courier, and a rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylistic missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, who works at the University of Trento, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book The Death Travel Office is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, make suggestions for solutions, and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I'm gonna beat them right out of here.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia are not attractive to foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head for that summer celebration.
The islands are also excellent for smuggling because the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir's been doing on his blue, ten-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If you fill a boat, you can fit 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients for him across Tunisia.
Guests arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again with the refugee crisis.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with a torch turned off.
On the first night, you drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes seafaring is hard, and in the 20 - foot [20 m] waves passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the journey, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir goes on a return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the hangers to death.
He tells in the book that when the police once caught sight of him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I picked up customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He says he's gonna have to assault his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat them out of here right now.
We need to show them right away who's in charge here.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is just a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - starter engine pulls its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometres southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed.
Men who travel without their family in the woods around the centre are housed in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovaða area, a large hub of human smuggling, people are dead tired.
Goran's drivers are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says Africans are trying to bargain.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly fool all the way.
First the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 200 miles, most of it comfortably on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran does not care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and throws away.
The Work of Kindness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda’s capital, attended by many believers who fled the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are moved from Congo to Europe.
He considers himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car, and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that it is advisable to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money a bit, and swoop among merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we come from war zones such as those in North Kivu, and that we have had to flee our homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be obtained.
It helps the missionary's contacts with Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, eventually the UN refugee organisation UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: it costs about EUR 100 to submit an application to the Ugandan police, about EUR 150 to process documents for humanitarian organisations and EUR 4 500 to EUR 7 000 to move to a European country, for example.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is an aspiring smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his early 40s is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
In the night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the freeway to the resting place where drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck... to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cut the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police thermal scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not smite the stowaways, at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporka, the Turkish has been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has constantly developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only claims the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scheme: Turkish ports rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, ships are being loaded into a crowded area of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul to land in a port and then to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd in sight.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ship journey after costs.
He does not do practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
In the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through covert companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a MP of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone missing.
Corrigendum 16 September 2015 at 3.10: The Death Travel Office book is published here, not next week.
American Olympic runner reports in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times at the Olympics, Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, a 1,500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book called Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and drifting into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran in the qualifying for the second best time.
However, in the final, he panicked.
From the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was depleted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and was passed by by other rivals one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with foreign men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton's becoming a prostitute was also that he missed the same adrenaline spikes as he had had while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner became apparent in late 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was world statistical number one at 1500 metres at 3.57.40, but was the last in Sydney Olympic finals.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski cock in check: "From the straightback"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the sports contract throughout the summer and autumn last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision received praise from two world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski cock in check.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season from the national team so that he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations, and will not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, in which he asserted that he wanted to have sports in Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup as well as then at the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, of which two gold medals.
He was part of the team that won the message gold in Falun last winter.
The plate day of the roast translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D., 25 September, there will be raptures in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted the Baking Translators' shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the highest-quality restaurants checked and classified by an independent operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received at the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
An Old Town restaurant is taking part in Kokkola's shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, which will take place in the same day across the world.
Finland continues to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: A complaint to the Attorney General about the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a reception centre for refugees in the premises of Kauhava's former garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis period is still in permanent location in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Ltd.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, whose impact has also not been clarified when preparing the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been taking place over the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy, among others.
The individual states to the Attorney General that the complaint is not a matter of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the incorrect location envisaged in the former garrison area.
Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center case last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters in the evening after meeting the chairpersons of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about managing the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues in a confidential manner.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the Russian and US activities in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also ignored in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The tram and subway staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the Starts close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Post services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is carried out despite the strike.
There is also an effort to deal with catering and hospital broadcasts and laboratory samples.
Information on situational services can be found on the Post website.
Most of the Starts of Finland close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 13 p.m.
Pam has also called on employees in the grocery trade to participate in the protest of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open by superiors if necessary.
According to Kesko, no information is yet available on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki Daycare Centres partially closed
The Helsinki Day Care Centres do not function to their full extent on Friday, informs the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency.

Daily day care centres and groups of children with mental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Office of Early Education promises to report further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media Investigator: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the PM's television and radio talks become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio talk be given to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be broadcast from 9.05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
It can also be seen in the Yle Arena.
The Cinnamon's taking a big risk
The media scholar hopes that Sipilä's television talk will not tell about a more general government's inward turn.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse to raise questions about the public debate? is considered by Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
Reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are not connected.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't react.
Political decision-makers' communication styles are not announcements in democracy.
It is the role of media representatives, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
Koivuse says TV talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there any more we've already heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old one, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
Even the general takes a risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled as a communicator of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with the interests of Yle or the general line.
A Shrewd Bet from the Clover
In the forthcoming speech of Sipilä, it is also important what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher emphasizes.
In the evening, we should look closely where Sipilä is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the moon, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, as this allows him to bring out his own vision without gravel sounds.
In this way, the message will be received by the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at an information conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech, because more specific questions will not be allowed to be asked.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether sweat leaks, hands trembles.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform about something, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners regularly engage in (U.S. President Barack).
That's really extraordinary.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
According to him, there has been no such thing in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations organize demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Spovo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed as well.
Antti Rinne (sd.), chairman of the SDP, again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy has been found and told, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inland Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to the Evening Journal.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create anger
A Kurdish-back free fighter Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Mr Amirkhani spoke heavily against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani tells us that he is disappointed in the fad of young people.
A 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick down on the ground, sit on the other one, and beat blindly without thinking of any of these consequences, as you make videos like this, Amirkhani upgrades.
It's hard to justify any more.
Some of the young people on the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police, fighting videos for social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
That's exactly what you guys are fighting over on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come to a very large extent.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you any more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives stakes to racism.
You make me hate something I don't like either.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
GERMANY takes a stand on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The Chairman of the GERMANY, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that on Monday, the employees' organization will reflect on its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK reported that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, the Chairman of the SAK, commented with little words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that the proposal by Prime Minister Sipilä's government for a social contract was not acceptable to the GERMANY.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social contract when the GERMANY refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: A grand demonstration threatens to blow up - "It seems a little funny to shake a fist"
It's a little funny to shake a fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary in the wage and salary camp from side to side.
Is it the intention to call the government down or, after all, to settle with it?
On Monday, the Federal Leaders of the SAK burst with holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavals.
The Teachers' Trade Union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the president of STTK, Antti Palola (sd) appeared arbitrarily.
He reported that he had kept in touch with the government and drafted an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his settlement papers were ready.
At first, there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the lock on the labour market".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
No wonder Palola's STTK has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Idealus, head of STTK's social influence previously served as a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As Palola described, the government's ay competence has been improving all along.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a bit off the Finnish seismics, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
You know, it's kind of funny to shake a fist if you already have a piece of reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified 6 p.m.: Added information on lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
The President of the Russian Duma Sergey Naryshkin criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, felt that Mongolia was a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, has begun, at which Naaryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to come to the meeting - something the President pointed out to journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation reached uncomplicated, so Naaryshkin continued to inject Finland with praise and praise for the "excellent organization" of Mongolia.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not be hindered.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to Russian media, has already discussed the meeting with the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The Astara and the Clave today continue the bull days in the Haka Forest when both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti anticipated that today, in Haka Forest, there would be no actual goal party.
Tapara visited Kuopio yesterday to carve a 3-2-continuation win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
There were round zero points as a guest of the blues, which had started loosely, and a loss rate of 2-3 as well.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The Astara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
In fact, in the previous two seasons, the Astara has just dropped in the semifinals from the Lock Finals series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tapara rose to the next three alongside and past.
There are no major changes in the formations of the groups except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers who both rejected yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
With the goal of the Astara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bearhus, and between the Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A bad play going on in Ace
The sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Iron Rock, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the lead.
In a sensational way, the underdog put up a heavyweight for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled Cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wooden-handed patpack proceeded to everyone's surprise at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori's Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
The Hope Child became blonde.
A fine TV commentator, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's renewal works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for Aces has built a pot on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky's pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are credited with something other than puck playing.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Iron Rockio is as clumsy in Rocky, written by Toivola, as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates the tough game, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of Äss tackled Tapara's Jere Karelian head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't accept that kind of game and it's not part of the ace puck, the hot Iron Rock snapped after the game for the People of Satakunta.
This season's team is oddly built.
There's a bunch of kids, veterans, cops, and promotions.
In practice, there are no key men of the best game age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in becoming the sports boss of Toivola.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season has as many losses as the goal difference of 1-6.
The Toivolan should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna Made Us Beautiful is drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Cricket.
Cricket tsmaps and supports his son, although his father Ricky (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come much closer.
They've met, they've talked on the phone, they've been texting.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Cricket was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
There was a depression in the '90s, and it was so dreary.
There was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga reports that he had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before film plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola's notorious skate story of known Tuukka.
Olga was a weekday and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka in the movie.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
Olga says he's been working with Tuukka so much over the past 10 years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything's always gone super well.
Now the entire production team goes to Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in Iit often plan to drive home for the sake of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They have received us so warmly, simply asking, which streets and when will be emptied?
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
The sequel of Scifi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play film ever made in Finland with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise after completion past Iron Sky 2, as the film's budget is over EUR 100 million.
Filming by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near Antwerp in AED Studios premises and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scary.
I've been so sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's any fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
However, 100 million would be added to the film because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's not one loose one.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond today on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film is played by Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov among others.
What do you mean, "dick" or "cool"?
Big logos return to shirts
The fronts of Trend Setters have recently been adorned by big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the label of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen as a somewhat hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportism has become a real fashion megatrendi, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often as before, the line between funny and trendy is glimmering: if something is already quite hillbilly, it starts to turn into ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which the trend setters surprised by preferring as dull basic clothing as possible as a means of separating themselves from the mass.
Instead of the grey basic college, the sweater shirt is already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' recognisable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos of panties are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace’s fall sweaters makes clear the mark of the garment.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present Russian war industry products.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Emergency Department had to disengage the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook pages, where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on their pictures, it is not a matter of being stuck or angry.
That's a lot of nonsense.
Let's start by not going inside the battle tank, but the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on the Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov, on the Russian Army's TV channel, explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he himself was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I definitely intend to visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and robust, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to Russkaja sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photos of alleged stuckness have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started initially with a Bloknot.ru site case where Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank door in an attempt and threatened eventually to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up case in which exhibition organizers reported their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä Mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand basin to the ditch.
The company says that measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains enriched sand and purified process water neutralized by the foaming process.
In general, the water is either pumped to be reused as process water or passed through a surface casting field to the environment as authorised.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic feet per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the reservoir dam structures has been observed.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report released today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) broadly reflects the views of the Government and the Treasury.
The organization was struggling with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist, Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of message in the IMF's assessment of the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Economics.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in its new forecast for the economic cycle, anticipates growth to be zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest observations as a basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in total output in the summer," says Kuoppamäki.
Again, less attention has been paid to the weakened trust in industry or to other so-called softer measures.
However, differences are only a matter of a few percent of decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under the death of cancer Satoru Iwata, starts working on Wednesday, Nintendo reported Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima is tasked with taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
An increasing number of minors arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are lost every year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector General of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear in "under country" per year?In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the course of the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of an adult age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made with a lapse decision because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is it growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on minors missing this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants for minors is therefore well known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons missing, he stresses.
What will happen to those who take the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear to the "dark labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered land seekers.
He has taken action.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see images of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to sickness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online announcement was first reported by the online magazine Evening Makasin.
Today, much of the equipment has been left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
However, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current Stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio equipment anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that a man who made a long career will no longer return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Stormylä in boxes.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The subway and tram drivers decide today whether to expand their force measures in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop subway and tram traffic only during a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says he's big on the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift supplements sting the drivers badly, so government plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
Hirvonen wonders that stopping traffic all day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport is virtually completely blocked in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There's no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the depot.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, run by superior forces, the HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus runs on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the news agency AP.
Sky News says refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas. The teacher thought the self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered the self-made watch he brought to school a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers considered the watch to look just like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation finally ended with the boy being handcuffed to a youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found that the watch looked like a "film bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic council wonders if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is rumbled - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
The song asks God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms of the right-wing press have also been shared by representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green felt Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial ceremony honored the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown his respect to the pilots by participating in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroics of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament, the abolition of austerity measures and increased public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament as party leader during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron rhymed on Twitter at the turn of the week with Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
South Lake Mintonka police have soon investigated a week of family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five was found dead in their home on 10 September and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for a checkup and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, police chief of South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the acts of blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his property on the social media site for nurses AllNurses.com.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site weekly.
I've been making 50 buy-ins over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Success was reflected in, among other things, the fact that in 2011 the Short family bought a fancy house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a car collector's dream in Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Legal proceedings pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
Acieve Test Prep, who offered various pre-papping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no defamatory comments had been removed from Short's website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether Short's transactions would have been affected very significantly by the trial.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded a Finnish Hippos month horse owner award at a race event.
This is great, Loiri commented with a good spirit on his honor board.
Celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros in winning.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, coach Korpi of the successful horse will gain full work peace while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll shut the fuck up, Loiri.
An amazing gesture from the NHL star - "The biggest athlete of all time donation"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about $6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital bulletin, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year and $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby holding his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a giant sum of money for another city's large hospital to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research to the hospital.
You can order a wife at a Japanese cafe for the evening. You can serve dinner in a bikini and an apron.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe on the market, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It strikes the lonely, the club-grubbing, and the hungry.
There's news from Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening at the Ore no Yome (My wife) café in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
She's just going to be wearing an apron and a bikini, and a husband in tight bike shorts.
The website offers all information about the length and weight of the candidates for wives to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's press release.
The Board consists of top security experts from around the world.
AsRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future based on ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 about 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve car cyber safety," says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been waiting years for the moon to rise.
At last, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford released information on RS now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS speeds up due to its 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, preliminaryly reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his press release.
The favourite brand Kia introduced two new features in Frankfurt's car show - such are the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing street SUV market, is certainly more important than the two new ones in Finland.
Sportage, created under Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
The wheelbase and the external dimensions have come a centimetre here and there, and the car splits air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but added a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
It will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty does not seem to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimos, equipped with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines, are at the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu went back to the stage, splattered in a brave jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a spectacular, open neck opening.
The costume beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer's star.
The whole is crowned by a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who became a mother has lost a pound of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year.
The singer released her first single from a new record in August.
Back to the platforms and standing in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really nervous.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release his new and at the same time fourth album called Polaris in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounded again - now you see the breast
Real-TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics one after another.
He presents his pregnancy stomach and chest equipment generously in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America when he and his sister Kourtney Kardashian left the concert of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the flashes flash.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last Friday, when the introduction was in the pregnancy belly.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to spell out that the model world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you did pose in top designer costumes in the previous season, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for work with conkars.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take up a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to drop the pounds, but then they say in Paris you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a gamble all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together, and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is dim.
Models want to be in this sector because of its potential, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a display of clothes.
Even models want to be their own persona.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
Fashion Weeks are currently being celebrated in New York City, where designers reveal their next year's collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the band's founding member, based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet the real Antti before, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's all right that I'm just learning his style of playing on video.
I don't want to make an impression on a person.
A man piloting the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band is not leaving for the role.
The Punk-manners come with the man naturally.
In the punk episode of the Stars and Stars program, I'm sure many people saw a preview, just like if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small-minded, but always goes full-scale.
The lead actors in the film You Made Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in 1993-2004, were announced today.
A core group familiar to the audience of the band is presented to the general public by still quite unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already released a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in mustaches and chin beards, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents in recent days have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to force the issue, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, for example, not allowing them to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed," he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about them elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
The child should not be intimidated in vain, even if it is distressed and frightened.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into a discussion about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring up the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, along with the children, can reason on how to view this in our family.
In the end, however, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational viewpoints - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if you also talk about difficult things in your family, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties you face in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to contain the ball lightning that hits the Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to sand Clover's ball salama to a tumult in midsummer.
It only ran wins and second positions until the collapse of the Tampere raves at the end of July.
Since the stallion collapsed thoroughly, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest head, but it took two medical courses to overcome it.
Since Clover's ball flash had to be on light exercise, the North states that it is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku in its record time after the Taruntuuli.
The clover’s ball flash was under great pressure from the break, having only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
In view of those things, a slight deflection at the end was understandable," says the North.
The coach assumes that a good race made the stallion a bit of a kick.
The horse must have moved on from it, and hopefully it would have evened out.
The clover's ball flash has been so-called humorous horses.
When you don't feel like it, you can't even get fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has been separated from the throttle of lightning that the opponents have been amazed.
At a short speed, co-competitors can't cope with the ball flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
In the hopes of the North, Vermo has a nesting run.
The difference is, however, how Clover's Ballbolt agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might even get stuck under the boom of the starting car and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer now than the departure of Turku.
The clover's ball flash can also come from the bow when it's fine, and we're going to drive it out of victory, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine, the company's CEO.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips, for example, come to mind.
The most recent addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks on the top.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it may cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is looking into it, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Euro area inflation declined to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate from a few weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9% from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU 28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
Consumer prices rose most in August by 1.4 per cent in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far removed from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is nearing a price increase of 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1% next year, the central bank anticipates its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
U.S. Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed resumes to raise its interest rates for a long time.
And in financial markets, the decline will begin before the next recession.
Fed has hinted that he might start raising interest rates already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market pace before that.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets act as they have done - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money claims as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report do not believe they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, by using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have behaved in the past at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what might result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile condition to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year
The leaders who decide on Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have all along the summer and early autumn hinted that time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in more than nine years can be made this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Management of Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage points interest rates, with which Fed increased its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years at a time.
The financial market symptoms began in 2007 with difficulties in housing financing the most risky in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started slower than has typically occurred since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than once since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and in places since the beginning of the 19th century.
As of the 1950s, they report on Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The beginning of the recession has taken less than one year since the first interest rate withdrawal, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended within one to two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
Fed has alternately increased and reduced its steering rate after the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the review, so it is unlikely that any of the effects of the subsequent interest rates will be inferred from them.
The strategies therefore point out that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be indisputably identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and the reasons for its increasing destructive power are fairly clear:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low in the 21st century for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks, and at the same time they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy, and already too high, grew even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The largest debt bubble in the economic history of the past arose.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost imperceptible to the financial economy, swelled most parts of the financial market with the largest price bubbles from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in the history of the economy so far.
Nor is there much controversy about the fact that the financial markets which rose to higher levels on the basis of ever more complex debt levers were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
Financial structures geared to debt, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted only a while after interest withdrawals had begun and the cost of debt financing had gone up.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give cause for thought by, for example, mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now considered the stance of their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time debt has not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not become lighter, but is now considerably heavier in various parts of the economy than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former less favourable and less costly central banks has mostly remained on the financial market and has been the most expensive of key types of securities and assets, whether the peak before or at any time before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategists flattened the mood with financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the model that has taken place in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but the pressures and risks on the financial markets are comparable to those before the financial crisis when Fed next begins to tighten up his cash flow.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, a strategy by the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time been coaching international investor clients of the bank Fed for the following full-turns:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to rush to shut down the financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed to HP Business Services, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on business sales in November, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer pc machines and printers.
HP's staff peaked at its peak in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard from Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000-30000 employees.
Consumer side reductions will remain in 3300 within three years.
HP plans to relocate its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is anymore responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
Still the other year, its three most important customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he filed a notice of resignation for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed time frame," says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Board of Directors and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings run through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capitalist with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context," says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not associated with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs' equity fund Triton already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo is home to a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first company-run reception centre is opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening six.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Salvation College.
The operations are operated by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the centre.
STK is preparing an alternative labour market tightening package
The STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the Government's tightening up of working life.
The organization also hopes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative measures to reduce the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola remarked to reporters during a hiatus of the organization's administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity for discussions.
STT's economists have calculated that the security of change contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared with 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if there's such a great deal of enthusiasm for a conversation on the part of the party if you're about to have one relationship to a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) has wanted alternative presentations by Wednesday, as then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation to implement some of the blackmails.
According to STTK, Palola does not welcome the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP, which has featured the issue.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
STK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to the protest, and the intention has not been to organise the strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, commends the STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK now comes to the same lines with Akava, as an alternative model for government performances has been outlined in Akava for a longer time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STTK reported earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive jump by the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
The Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the country's government and employers," Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech marking the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's address instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more ceremony.
In the fall of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train runners' strike with a television talk.
Solitude, monarchist stuff.
Sipilä’s speech has sparked criticism and speculation all day about what is going to happen.
The president of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated on Twitter that "Sipila could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, allowing the speech to be discussed as well".
According to Greens Ville Niinistö, "one-off has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Koomija of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist action: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "A short six months after the election.
No appearances from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's @juhuasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented live by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was a public service mission to promote publicity throughout Finland, a line in the news by Ismo Silvo Yle, the director of Yle's publications.
♪ Like us in Tammel time ♪
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
Mom puts on a cuter hat, and Dad compromises the tie on her neck.
At 9 a.m., they quiet down to television as they used to at Me Tammels time," writes bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that it is forced to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
For what Sipilä says, one guess is made by Viva, the Green Left of Tampere University.
It has released an accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit tonight?
The coupons and pens are ready, it starts at 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries rejected Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to dissuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan to allow al-Assad to give up power in style after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed to him in a bilateral debate the plan of three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad immediately needed to have a speaking connection and the abandonment of al-Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with all of them, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, Sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats don't comment
Ahtisaari tells us that he has transmitted the message from Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate for the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is hesitant about the speeches made by Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected, even then, that it would have been Putin's trick to keep power on some supporter of al-Assad.
The Refugees — Our Own Works
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum seeker's organization centre is going to Tornio
The organization centre for asylum seekers, designed by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center would be established in an empty Tornio joint lyse building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has looked for a suitable location to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present a school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) Vice-President of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specified to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the conference.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive," Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint act at a time.
An expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense," Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the holiday money in the public domain would only account for part of the government's effort to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were seeking compensatory measures for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a means of working, as it would target almost all employees in contrast to, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday supplements.
The labour market organisations could agree between themselves to cut holiday money because it is recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a Government Communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work then starts to move, so the train is on the move and it is becoming more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time now.
It won't take long for such things to happen, if there is a will, the Sipilä formulated.
The list released last week by the government includes the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without shortening annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of illness are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, a number of trade unions have declared political strikes because of the actions.
Lake Tohma Council approved expansion of the Mahalahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, which was slightly murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally discussed.
Also, a busy schedule with a heart attack.
It was also wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the last extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous firm stance to bring Karelian street names to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after a new decision, no Karelian street name signs will appear in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready to use Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of Karelian language is also worth being open-minded at a time when multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of these can well be utilized in the variety of marketing in the province.
Discontinuation of rail links cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the province's life force with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the business life and competitiveness of the province.
And that will make it possible to live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not have the chance of being reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the abolition of these transport links on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of access links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that even at the moment it is difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the traffic connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of students from the University of Eastern Finland are currently coming from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, about 10-20% of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sounds for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siu social project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is also included.
A member of the City Board, Pentti Centralsalo (sd., in the picture) presented the abandonment of the entire project at the Board's Monday meeting, but his performance fell unsupported.
The Board approved a proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one train shift.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train shift is left out, but still five times a day gets from Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are being cut off altogether.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys bailed.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed to the roof from a wedge, who could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on the Ketotie at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs adjacent to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others swerved from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to help with the towing ladder the last one safely left on the roof back to the ground.
Variation in FedEx's turnover, weaker outlook for the 2016 financial year
FedEx announced its poor performance in the last quarter. The transport industry left its profit forecast for the whole year due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
FedEx forecast is between $10.40 and 10.90 for the financial year ending in May, with a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite an average price increase of 4.9%. The increases will come into effect on 4 January. Additional charges for the transport of heavy or large consignments will come into effect in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased turnover and increased e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has performed in a very weaker economic situation than expected, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans for hiring seasonal workers were announced the day after competitors UPS announced their plans to hire more or less the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means a 6% increase.
The earnings per share were $2.42, leaving the forecast of $2.44 by the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decrease in international first-class broadcasts, which has caused the company's Express unit to be stagnant.
The strong growth in e-commerce has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed higher costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opened, FedEx's share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average of the year and 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, U.S. Federal Bank Fed’s decision-makers meet for the most anticipated meeting in years. A group sits at a six-foot-long Honduran wooden table in diameter to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A wall painting of the United States appears on the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-story meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must put the state's financial interests before all other interests.
The central bank has a dual order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's management has noted the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece of the difficult decision. On Thursday, the central bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start weaning off the unpredictable stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that remained close to zero in late 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady economic growth, recent turmoil in the financial markets can cause the officials of the already cautious central bank to freak out more volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even in the quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of the Banker Movement Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who have wondered do not agree with what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in a study conducted by Bloomberg were concerned about the rise in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are thought to be waiting for the central bank, and according to the key indicator there is only a 30% chance of raising.
If the central bank raises its key interest rates, stock prices may fall unless policy makers soften the blow by promising another withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index defected 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85.
"The background to the cooling was the expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this point," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of financial market players without shaking."
The second, on the other hand, noted that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be leaning towards raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, a first small step towards tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has stated throughout spring and early summer that he had expected interest rates to be raised this year – despite the fact that, according to the Liberals, economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank will calculate as full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual targets of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers stated that the main reason for this is the drastic temporary impact of oil prices.
"Economics can survive even at higher interest rates and need them as long as they take into account the tight situation in the labour market," Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said.
However , financial markets worldwide did not startle last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by nearly 10% of the peak of May.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank are even more complicated to consider how to raise the interest rate.
"The work of the central bank becomes more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate senior researcher and former Central Bank official Stephen D. Olier stated.
Now he believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information on the situation following recent developments in the Chinese economy," Olier said.
The consolidation of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential player in the world monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow the scope of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring developments in the world, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science," Zachary Karabell, director of the global strategy for fund management company Envestnet Inc, said.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank stated this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial movements that do not seem to have a connection with the fundamental pillars of the economy.
A member of the Federal Open Market Committee has called for the steering interest rate to be raised, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the central bank deciding to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, although there were only limited identifiable sanctions for US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should prioritise monetary stability only in a major crisis such as the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Committee.
The latest turmoil does not even draw close to the situation at the time," he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates due to market shock," added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this changes, I don't think I should get ahead of myself."

Brazilian Association of Rio Grande Pediatricians Promotes a Good Diet for Breast-feeding
The Rio Grande Children’s Association in Brazil SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach nursing women the importance of a decent diet. They are presented with pictures of babies being breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, giving the baby all the food he needs and developing a strong immune system.
Due to the excess energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, other changes in diet should be made in addition to increasing calorie intake.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine of Texas revealed that the healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers, although Nine tries to catch the lead on her Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would ask Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership election, which, however, did little to improve Today's ratings.
The morning program for the Nine channel was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull displaced Tony Abbott.
The morning show of the rival channel, directed by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London. Special broadcasts of the week are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The gap apparently did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrisea watched an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and Today's show, in turn, 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but missed reading last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reached a distance to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrise's 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers so far.
Here's the most interesting event all morning.
The changes in the winds this morning will have a greater impact on Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Significant novelty Seven had a 800 Words novelty series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the ratings last night, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor retained its strong position with 1 136 000 viewers. The series baffled brightly The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
Andrew O'Keefe hosted the first half hour of the new series of quiz (17.00–17.30) followed an average of 446,000 spectators.
On the second half hour (17.30–18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than it was on Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase in the first half of Australia had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the second half collected a staggering 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's ratings were 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night ratings showed the Nine channel that Hot Seat will pass again at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final three think Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of the bachelor of dreams, Sam Wood, has been a carefully guarded secret.
The three remaining women do not say a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows' moods before dropping one of the three. Women could inadvertently hint who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finale.
All three women glowed that Wood was the perfect man. Women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him to be a suitable partner for himself.
When asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit its own spot, their answers may indicate who takes the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after himself the most suitable partner for Wood.
It's been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As soon as I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and she's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I must admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this isn't just a race. I'm betting on our relationship now," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose him, the woman mysteriously replied:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls just as much as Snezana and Lana are equal."
Bachelor of Dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for NFL career start
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also became interested in him after last year's impressive open day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man was with the Australian rugby team. Hayne messed up the flight kick after the team took a win on Tuesday from Minnesota by 20–3.
However, Tomsula showed her confidence in Hayne and gave him another chance to return the flight kick. Coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the locker booth after the game.
He did not rush the newcomers in front of the rest of the team but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers' special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne in the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fan group had been expecting something else from the man's NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after a failure, raining and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that she could not have imagined a more miserable start to her NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the error to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his pass in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
Overall, however, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old youth.
Hayne released a picture on Instagram where she pose with fans and Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.

Four dead policemen shot with rubber bullets protesters in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of officials reported on Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in a demonstration that allegedly was unconstitutional in the country. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than three hundred kilometres from the capital of Kathmandu.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal reported that the police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally regarded as a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of continued protests in the southern Nepalese plains, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe calls for its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent skirmishes since 10 August,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive subject in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been being worked on since 2008, but the legislatures accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking April earthquake.
Lawmakers have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities say that a new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide area of low pressure about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands may be able to develop a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, announced by the United States National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear center of low pressure in the midway between Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone with a 60% probability over the next two days.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign in a particularly personal way on its blog.
Instead of management, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud by telling about her own experiences. She was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migration crisis escalates, many families in similar situations are in dire need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected at the address google.com/refugeerelief through $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, reaching an overall amount of 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since World War II, particularly the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war is also to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-operative treatment.
"Death information takes time," reported Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have involved pathologically overweight patients with a BMI of at least 35.
The body mass index indicates the weight and height of the normal value between 18.5 and 24.9.
When the body mass index is over 25, the person is overweight, and the body mass index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and sleeve surgery, to treatment for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
Following obesity surgery, the average body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of those treated without surgery remained close to 29.
In patients treated with surgery, diabetes improved completely by 36% and in part by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also showed better blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol in the surgical group.
The researchers also monitored the haemoglobin-A1c levels in patients, which describe the development of blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
The hemoglobin-A1c indicates control of blood glucose levels. However, a study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over a period of five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgical procedures.
In the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the fall in the body mass index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was the decrease in haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes improved completely in the larger part (46.9 per cent and 16.7 per cent).
The new study failed to show lower mortality after five years. According to a Swedish study by Blackstone, the University of Arizona College of Medicine, Phoenix, however, surgery brings years of life to obese persons.
In a Swedish study, the incidence of mortality in obese persons undergoing gastric bypass surgery decreased by 29 percent over 15 years compared to the conventional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone nevertheless confirmed that persons with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group, and it does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27–30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When the human body has accumulated genetic changes that predispose to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
It is not possible for Europe to receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading figure in Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the refugee crisis during a speech in the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, humanity should be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not enough in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria's response to the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how to achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce the killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
The force has never solved the problems," he added.
In speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to forces that had unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Ingestion cases of handicraft quadrupled in children in four years
According to Georgia's Poison Centre, intoxication centers across the United States report cases of alcohol-intensive hand-decide ingestion nearly quadrupled in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Poison Centre, children under 12 years of age reported cases of hand-dish ingestion to poison centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1,6 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are forced into emergency care," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handcraft on purpose, some to impress their friends and some to be incited by social media.
YouTube videos feature teenagers who drink disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers reportedly mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handwashes.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just scented.
There are handmade products of strawberry, grape and orange that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"Handides' alcohol content is very high," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a shot of whiskey available to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left available to children, they quickly get a high amount of alcohol."
The six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four loracs of strawberry-scented handicrafts at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult hop limit," says Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated the girl from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah made up and was unable to walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
The doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey told.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
My daughter could have been killed.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes, in addition to moving your hands beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing handcrafts containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as active substance in the product fiche.
According to a police report, three fourth-grade students in northern New York State were planning in January to kill a "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products throughout the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to handwash and banned it from being brought into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that went down was meaningless and called for disciplinary action by the school.

The Dutch yearning for an old Scottish battle partner — de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has fallen because no more double struggles between Celtic and Rangers can be followed.
De Boer, a team leader in Ajax, stated: "The Netherlands no longer presents the highlights of Celtic's games.
Because Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch are looking for a double fight between the teams.
Old Firm games have tremendous tension, and they are also of interest outside the Scottish borders."
I'm turning things around, Deila assures me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures that there will be a change in the situation.
The club lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it stirs up hatred or grief in many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic supporters, which will considerably strengthen players.
The collective spirit is very important now."
Warburton cautious in January player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January's player relocation targets, he is cautious about the transfer routing and says that he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"Tampoon player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's ex- coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer can be used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our line-up this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player procurements can cause the team more harm than benefit."
Michu, who is thinking about retirement in Celtic’s sights
Swansea's attacker Michu has been attached to Celtic in player transfer speeches. Michu, on the other hand, has hinted about retirement after the Swans contract ended.
For years, 29-year-old Michu has been plagued by an angry ankle and failed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA combat from Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2–1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3–2. The defender's red card was later overturned. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months that will be overturned.
However, Neilson remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was rebuked when the man admitted to profaning abusive vocal lyrics from former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching leadership – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's leadership team can make the situation better, and extradition on the field can no longer be allowed.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is pleased with the Hamilton win with a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to hold on desperately to Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league victory, with victory, Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neck on Celtic at the top of the show table, for which is thanks for Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes stated.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July. There are 164 000 unemployed. In the United Kingdom as a whole, the number of unemployed increased by 10,000 at the same time.
According to the United Kingdom Statistical Institute (Office for National Statistics), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 people in work in Scotland less than three months earlier, and the number of people in work is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the United Kingdom as a whole having an average employment rate of 73.5%.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a strong economy."
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received the invitation through a man’s best friend and despite my shock, I said yes.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you a true story about the death penalty.
The view would be unique.
Reporters are allowed to follow executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than seats, participants are selected with a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to 5.
The chosen follow the execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with a man, because we've been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to prison staff, I cannot be present both as a witness and as a journalist, so I am not allowed to take along a notebook and pen to make notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details in my mind.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a manner that pleases him, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter my dissenting opinion.
The reporter lady admitted that she could have phrased her words more carefully, but still considers my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist to write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity contributes to the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
A neutral description can be read in other reporters' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry as he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's attempt to escape stopped in shallow, muddy water, and the police a few yards away were able to get the man back on dry ground.
On Tuesday, the Canning Vale police received a call about an unauthorised stay in Beckenham.
Upon arriving, the police found a suspect who sought to shake off the police by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police to water to pick him up," senior sergeant Shandell Castledine told.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted to water the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic – negotiation.
"Sometimes an attempt to escape causes people to resort to amusing means," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees attempted to spy, and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria's suppliers of attempted espionage with his stables last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment recently given on race day was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always working for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample, and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue in check for espionage allegations for a year and a half, and did not want the accusations to seem like the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration erupts once in a while," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I must now accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I'll go home and sleep well at night.
I want to go upright, and I want the owners of horses to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, then I'm no longer the horse coach.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he reported attempts to spy on the integrity department at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him his name when asked," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught for anything illegal.
Former RVL president Robert Roulton, current RVL president David Moodie and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal pursuit?
Should the RVL take real action and assume responsibility for the situation in the sector other than the coaches?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the business?
Maybe a lot of people think that.
Maybe I'd still get a coaching license and push me out of my job, and there's no doubt that when I talk about it, I'll make a lot of people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm putting pressure on them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
A long investigation into Lidar's cobalt values and a recent rejection situation led the coach to become frustrated in the end that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as coach of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, a man who described race day's treatment rule as ridiculous after a clay wrap placed on the horse's feet contrary to the rules.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," said Moody.
"A person from my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody may be expected to be subject to a three-month non-compete ban on non-compliant clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to resolve.
"This is a joke.
The rules are drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested at Cobram crash scene
Police have arrested a man who came across a cyclist this weekend who escaped the scene of an accident.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, who suffered serious injuries after a car crashed into him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man driving the car fled the scene and did not remain to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalata reported to the Sheppardon police.
The man is likely to be facing charges of non-compliance with stopping and assisting obligations in a road accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital care and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refers down to opponents' wrestling talks
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy regards criticism of his team's tackle game as a purpose-oriented action by the NRL's two league favorites.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm wrestling to the annoyance of Melbourne's hosts in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to Storm after the Broncos won the qualifying finals on Saturday night of Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and stated that Queensland does not care more about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they just focused on contact while tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top teams coach criticized his team. Bellamy considers this an indication that coaches worry about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I remember Trent Robinson talking nothing about wrestling when his team won us 24–2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defense system or technology all year long, the last six weeks we've just invested in a contact game and tackles, which has turned us into a takeoff.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and losing might have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St George received plenty of criticism for his boring game. Wayne stated that the review won't stop him.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast-trackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player-arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have co-defenders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so concerned about meeting my team that they resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in Storm and Roosters' game than in the Broncos and Cowboys encounter.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16–12?
The end result of our game was 20–18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are gambling breaks and low-goal football interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably face them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be invited to visit either North Queensland Cowboys on Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man freed for $200,000 bail in a drug case
For the 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, a man awaiting a possible life sentence has been released for bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo on the Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Comemera in August.
The police observed the meeting of Maksimovic and an accomplice at the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Comera Roadhouse café. A 40-pound drug batch was found in the Toyota Echo car at the parking lot.
Although Maksimovic may be awaiting life imprisonment for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, according to the man's lawyer, there is no evidence that his client attempted to gain control of the entire lot, but the man may have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
According to Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will attempt to flee the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bails against which the man was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan stated.
"It's not enough to stop a man running," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and stays home from six o'clock in the morning to six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to gain control of photos of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and signed for an online messaging service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, after waking up, the girl found the phone missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five photos were reported to the police. After examining the computers found at the address, police found disturbing Internet searches using search words to retrieve inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and impersonating a police officer with a view to scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson stated in the local justice system at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation of people.
He admitted to doing the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so to play the police and thus to frighten pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He said that he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding messages on the phone, she cried to her mother shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate photos on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl reported that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed to possession of inappropriate child photos on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be placed in the sex offenders' register, as it can be considered that the crime did not contain any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October due to background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail on this issue, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sex offenders even before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
Africa's oldest head of state Mugabe fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
The opening of this House was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted a speech on the situation of the President's state in Parliament with interlocutors, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) bishop Innocent Gonese noted that seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message's title is "death," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer immune.
According to the party's whimper, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of the business services business.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates computer and printer business from faster growing business hardware and service activities.
According to the HP bulletin, the company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion in the arrangements starting in the fourth quarter.
"Reorganizations enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," told HP CEO Meg Whitman, who runs the company after division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style". Whitman said.
"As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company, according to its mission, focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
Founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, Stanford University, the company is now divided into two. The two founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
Massive restructurings have been carried out in HP as traditional desktops are moving into mobile devices.
The changes of the world's second largest computer manufacturer and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest in a sector where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Captain Mikel Artata of Arsenal: The team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four England national team games, and knowing his history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The main trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere ended the last season strongly after an ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," Wenger stated.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger also stated, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in only 65 out of a total of 157 league games over the last five seasons.
Arsenal's wider picture is that since the 2007-2008 season in six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams losing money due to the injuries most.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to evolve for the better.
"Sometimes, a return after injury may be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time when you need to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal begins his Champions League contract on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. The team then meets Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the following Wednesday. Wenger prepares minor changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Artatha are likely starters.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott in the starting lineup.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the continuation of the F group, Maksimir Zagreb has one of the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games for the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night when the ground trembled with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson since he had to bend over to Monaco last season. He is also still motivated by the distant desire to pilot the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet hit this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also realistic with experience.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series, which is noteworthy, especially given that men's need to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide statistics are at their highest levels in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 men's year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, those suffering from depression have better chances of getting better if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The likelihood of illness among asymptomatic persons was also halved if there were persons close to them who had no mental health problems.
But it is all based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content. Fast response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, although isolation is a reality.
The values, money, image and social status that come from the outside of superficial success are all distracting from our inner values and our natural longing for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently stated that money really cannot buy happiness.
The fineness of the Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the show were defined by profession, but by personality, which was reflected in friendships.
The show humorously featured Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that men could identify with this even though they did not refrain from knowing fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should survive is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a time of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set of the show has been brought back to life. So if you attend the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship that can develop.
Comedy Central broadcasts the whole Friends series – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on strike when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by beating Malmön at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. He strengthened the position of the French champions immediately in handshake. However, PSG screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for a sequel in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarterfinals in the remaining three games.
Although the SPG caught the score, the match was not a perfect performance of the team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal seat and the man was replaced when faced with his former home club, where the man began his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so a 2–0 win and good grips give us a good basis, even though we still have a few things left to clean up for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do so, but I'm sorry that we couldn't do one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after being injured. The team had to settle for a 2–2 draw in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. Di Maria, however, left Ibrahimovic out of sight at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine platform, which moved from Manchester United to the PSG, was named a PSG solver, raising the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the appointment when he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt's pitch past Malmö's defense and then fired an exact hit at the back corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, those who waited for the PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players to the field from the start. The team playing with five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot narrowly missed Kevin Trapp's goal backstop in the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG succumbed in vain to pitch and weak finish, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Immediately at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick pitched the goal to the rear of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic pointed his fingernails in the pass game. From Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a twist kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
Another goal was scored at the Count's time thanks to Cavan. A six-year-long Uruguayan shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic pitched him a left winger for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's Kiri ended in another goal, and only Wiland's top-retardant David Luiz's close range to fire the shot kept the readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end.
Malmön pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class of its own. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
Qualifiers aren't enough.
Hats for Parisians.
This was their top game."
Glencore raises $2.5 billion on the stock issue
Swiss mine giant Glencore, who was hit by falling raw materials prices, raised US$2.5 billion in the Wednesday share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market value decreased by 57 per cent this year. The company is grappling with the collapse of raw materials as the Chinese economy's recession hampers demand and burdens the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's share price hit the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday for the beginning of the morning.
The stock rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 p.m. in the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69% increase.
Glencore announced last week its intention to raise $2.5 billion in the share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 cents, with a 2.4% drop in Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the Group as a whole.
Concerns about the continuation of the economic downturn in China have caused the price of iron ore to fall by half, while the fall in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 % and 40 %.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
A communication published by the White House on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping travels to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives on his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, a counter-visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
Following bilateral discussions between Heads of State, the President of the United States and President's wife Michelle Obama arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to honor the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will enable US-China cooperation to be extended in a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues that are divided," states the White House's Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February, and is expected to visit Seattle to meet several U.S. technology leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip would continue first to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and Xin are expected to raise a number of controversial issues such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activities in controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon spoke fiercely with African-American Effie Brown and stated that there is no need for diversity behind the camera.
In a Sunday night episode of the HBO Project Greenlight series, an experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to consider the different views of the project for the dark-skinned protagonist of the selected script.
"Diversity is taken into account in film casting, not in program casting", Damon claimed.
Brown burst in dismay and hurt by the claim. "Wow, that's it," the woman stated, after Damon's comment starring in Mars Alone.
Damon and Brown had gathered with other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is the director, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is portrayed," Brown said at first.
"The only dark-skinned character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp".
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors. Damon harshly replied that the choice of the two could lead to a unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was aired on television, social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger over the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only dark-skinned person to explain what diversity is is is so white-skinned that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed over 5,000 times and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is one of the topics of speech.
After a teenager Michael Brown died of a white police bullet in 2014. Black Lives Matter movement gained support throughout the country. The movement aims to end discriminatory treatment of lawmakers and authorities for dark-skinned people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album nominees of the year at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he stated.
"Just like books and dark-skinned lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published a statement in response to Fow News's question about whether that group should be described as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," the management of the movement stated.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is not known whether Damon has answered the call in a yes.
American Ninja Warrior series first winner
Professional climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for $1 million for his win.
For the first time in the seventh season of the TV series, all the tasks assigned were clarified.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the final assignment, men had to cut up the 23-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten explained the mission in the first given time. He was the first contestant to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race successfully. However, Caldiero completed the task three seconds faster and became a winner.
Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after catching a million dollar pot.
"The winning amount is incredible, as I have never made more than $10,000 a year," he stated in an interview with E! for his winning pool.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine the consequences of this, the future is wide open."
The corresponding producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten was not rewarded, although he was the first competitor to have clarified all the tasks.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more contestants find out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"The money prize is of course great and revolutionizes life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and brood about it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a great deal of praise from fans.
Britten's a great guy. He's important to his family.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he preferred to beat Isaac.
He also believes Isaac would have thought the same of him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed to the eighth season, whose filming starts in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed the victory over the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers do not have particularly comfortable experiences in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in Baseball, are now in the final position of American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
Twins missed their chance to get up to Houston Astros to fight for another wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even for just one night, to a taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every win is nice, no matter how it is achieved," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
The Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held his ground when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts of good play and let three runs go.
He's only had three good beginnings on nine out shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for a change-player to throw in every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth turn."
Tigers pitcher substitute Victor Martinez got three hits and hit two runs, which were his first beat runs after mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-shot night after he received four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He hit well," Ausmus stated.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept the stream in play".
In the latter turn of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
The mid-cop Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-hive hit near the left sideline with a directed punch.
The right catcher Aaron Hicks battled the sacrifice beat, and Simon took second Brian Dozier, who took three straight passes before being replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass for Mauer, and the rookie pitcher, Miguel Sano, hit two bases, and then right-handed Drew VerHage.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got Trevor Plouffen, number three, to burn two players.
Major League team led 27 times this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had hit the certification run on the first turn of the ninth shift, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon struck a two-run hit, and the situation was 5–4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight passes and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers had three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed guy who had just made it back from the list of injured to the fields, a man who was on the side for a month due to back infection.
"Of course, the start was not as I would have hoped. However, as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and a few good pitches in the third inning," Hughes said.
After reaching the lead, Hughes gave a single nest hit to second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catch J.D. Martinez's free pass brought Victor Martinez the game's first imported run.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak broke when the team had players at the nest.
Three's Nick Castellanos was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned in an attempt to advance to three.
Tigers increased their lead in the second inning, catcher James McCann survived a hit on second base and Anthony Gose to first base, with a situation of 3–0.
"A hell of a hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but the punch hit the right spot."
The pitcher was Hughes, who pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced with a right-handed substitute for A.J. Achter.
Hughes' balance became three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight assists.
Notable: Tigers' right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the lineup due to a blowback.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to a shoulder tear since mid-August, and was scheduled to be included on Wednesday.
When Sanchez does not play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured and is involved in the starting lineup against Twins.
Norris has received 1–1 in four games since he was traded to the left-handed batter David Price on July 30.
He has been out of the lineup since August 20 due to a crooked ab rupture.
Tigers and Twins finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) will face Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth," said President Xi Jinping at the meeting of the economic reform steering group on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop economic opening policies," the President said at the 16th meeting of the central leadership group set up to deepen comprehensive reform.
"By promoting a policy of opening up and deepening reforms, new impetus and vitality for economic growth will be triggered," said Xi.
The Management Group approved guidelines, including a negative list of market access rules, a relaxation of border control policy, the promotion of private capital participation in state-owned enterprises, and the revision of the system of registration of citizens.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a significant change as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, the legal business environment and market opening.
The Board also mitigates the control of companies and their desire to ensure that companies have the power to decide on their own business.
According to the Communication, China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border regions and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The opening up of state-controlled sectors will open up many sectors to private investment.
"The government does not change its foreign investment policy; it supports the legitimate interests of companies that have received foreign funding and provides them with better services," the Communication states.
In addition, applying for a permanent residence permit will optimise requirements and streamline the application process.
The meeting also dealt with the right of lawyers to pursue their profession and to support judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
