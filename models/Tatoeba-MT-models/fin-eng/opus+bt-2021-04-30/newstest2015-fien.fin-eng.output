The City of Juankoski joins the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the union on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal union, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide to conduct the following municipal elections separately.
The municipal elections will be held next time in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.
Indian and Japanese Prime Ministers meet in Tokyo

Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists of East Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tassi.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by the Russian Army by Kiev and the West, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the residents of the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Repairs.
It surprised me that people came in from the very beginning of the evening.
There were visitors in two days as expected, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year.
We're still going to be hip-hop festivals, which means there's no pop coming, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland enters into force a law restricting the acquisition of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Government for a permit to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, starting materials acquired prior to the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rapes by Nairn and Pitlochry
There's a trial waiting for a man accused of rape in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire Province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in her "while unconscious state, sleeping, and being so unable to make a decision for herself".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh before the Supreme Court.
Valio League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Valio League - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is regarded as the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from that of Manchester City.
The Balotelli was still a long way from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and pitched only half of its sixteen pitches to their own team.
Pool supporters who have already preferred the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers implanted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who traveled to Barcelona, as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotelli, sparkled the center field diamond tip Raheem Sterling, who poked a 3-0 win past Hugo Lloris's important opening goal.
Sterling, 19, it's not just great.
An Englishman 20 cents shorter than Balotelli is between the opposing lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who speeds about 34 km/h on the grass at his best.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of praise for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman reported how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the northwestern London who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The newspapers down to the Los Angeles Times have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will begin her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in our country's music life for over 100 years, including performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation enthusiastically," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karelian
Today, a new impetus is being sought for the pension negotiations from the social partners' own meetings.
The management of the SAK, Akava and STTK of employees' organisations will deal with the negotiating situation in the morning.
Since then, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
The labour market organisations have been hampered, among other things, by the dispute over the commitment of retirement age to life expectancy.
Organizations have promised a career solution by autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created during this week.
Plier-pudas.
The Rovaniemi-based women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped to league-raiser Vampul's athletes at the Pihtiputa training tournament final on Sunday.
The vampu twisted five of a single extended match to a 3-2 win.
The last round WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all along.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampul was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyro.
WoVo's spruce was broken in that the 190-inch American centreon Jennifer Keddy was backs stuck on the side.
As a center, Sara Niemi played.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury and formed the most fire-powerful combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a feller, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampu was a skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who was toured as much as possible by WoVo.
WoVo's preparation for the league continues at the turn of next week as the HPK of Hämeenlinna arrives at training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at "the store" at 6 p.m. in the official practice game.
On Sunday, we meet at the Sports College again.
Lidl beats wild figures in Finland
During the financial year ending at the end of February, the turnover of the company's Finnish stores grew by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also reported that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is a member of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and complicated access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Chief Investigator Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Scientists went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 per cent more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficulty in accessing treatment as possible.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote care is becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients who are far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long - term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old housewife in Gold Coast, Elisha Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wishes to confirm with the station formula the snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to Hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Government decided that the proposal for a station plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be placed on public display at a service point in Osvivia.
Statements on the draft plan are requested from the Environment Board and the Ely Centre of Lapland.
With the help of the station design change, the city wants to allow the continuation of snowmobile activities related to tourism in the region.
The site is intended to form a park area that includes an area between the current Friendship Park and its river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available on the spot between 15 November and 30 April.
Refuelling points may also be placed in a given part of the area.
Maintenance services are also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the lease is valid until spring 2018.
The snowmobile parking activity and the change in formula have caused even loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring apartment houses have been grumpy about both sound and concern about emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been investigated and the surveys have not revealed any findings above the guide values.
The new equipment is also less polluting than it was before.
A friend park as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, hotel safari pigs should transport safaris to the departure points on buses estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also sufficiently extensive, better than the places presented as replacement departures, such as the east side of the Ounas River Bridges adjacent to the boat platform.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because activities can expand in the future, for example, to the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of parking is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the central part general formula, which has not yet gained legal power.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is seen in garden stores
The decrease in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under the age of 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales on their age. The Financial Times reported a study by the British Gardens Trades Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, tenants spend only 55 percent of the money used by home owners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanized dwellings without gardens. Furthermore, the size of the garden is reduced as the front yard is increasingly covered as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion a year.
In a major area of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are used the least per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in the rent of dwellings or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the RHS' leading garden counselor, says that "for example, plants grown in mobile breeding vessels are particularly popular among tenants because such breeding vessels can be included in the change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997–2005 were the booming season for the resale of the horticultural sector due to the increase in housing ownership and wealth from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year's trade will pick up due to better weather conditions, after last year's March and April weather was worse.
Turkey is interrogating an American diplomat because of an espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to report on the report on the espionage in Turkey by Americans and British.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the report was discussed on Monday by the U.S. Embassy's affairs manager and the Turkish authorities.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spy for US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on the espionage directed by the German Chief Intelligence Service in Ankara caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.

Majorcan Magaluf Police Chief charged with corruption
Those who identified the incident presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and officials of the City Board of Calvià at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, located on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by shop owners and bar owners of the Magaluf area known for wet celebrating.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several Punta Ballena Street business owners filed corruption charges against him. On Punta Ballena, most of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who indicated the incident presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià City Board officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges and they are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a countrywide daily, wrote about the biased authorities of nightclub owners, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not money anymore, it's survival," one business owner stated to the court.
You're not destroying our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was distributed online, with an 18-year-old British holidayer having oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, drunk pub crawlie.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the club owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly fined €55,000.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or balcony to hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas War and schools remained closed as the area recovered from battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket - bombed southern Israeli communities, but the tracks of battle are still visible.
In the south town of Ashdod, in the Pashosh day care centre, workers removed fragments from the walls and slided before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We're a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that coming back to school after a long time feels "a little weird".
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbuts near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of the ceasefire last week, thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the community of Nahal Oz in the vicinity of the Gaza front are skeptical about the return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Department of Education, over ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have so far been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of".
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire in force for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and the reopening of the Gaza air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers shot 4,591 rockets and grenades in battles to Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks injured or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in over 100 U.N. schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and fighting continued, school officials moved the school's start the previous week.
"I hope the school opens soon and we can get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in shelter at a school in Gaza City.
According to the commonly used meter, house prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic house price index, which measures the prices of Australian capital dwellings, rose by 1.1% in August, revealed RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose by 4.2 per cent over the summer, July and August period, or more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not increased steadily throughout the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
The results of RP Data show that house prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next the busiest; the average price increase is 5 to 6%.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in sales of apartments to be auctioned, the overall high sales rate and the continuing low interest rates, it is likely that the increase in house prices will continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has pulled record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have drawn record audiences this summer to Mäntä.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä's Art Weeks again told me on Monday that they had set a visitor's record, after 14,500 interested people had visited the Waiting Event this summer.
I don't think we've gotten used to these numbers.
People have fallen from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors throughout the year will come to Serlachius Museums this year to draw close to 100,000.
In previous years there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always open to phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä it is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts committed in Kajaan in the last few days.
On Sunday night, a business property was broken into by breaking the window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck tank on Deepojankatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its rear engines had been taken from the boatport of the cheating neck.
The rowing boat was white and yellowish from the outside.
On the inside, the text "OIVA" was written on the nose.
A couple of suspects have already caught up with the police.
On Sunday night on the Tikkapurontie, a business property was broken into.
The police dog got a print and a man in his 20s was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, police caught another man in Paltamo who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
The missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaan.
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought the murder charge to a Kenyan man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone with his common-law spouse and another man into the apartment and shot a 34-year-old Kenyan woman with a shotgun to export drugs to the apartment he suspected to be a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man involved was a shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when the police patrol stopped a car with a company that had been burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burned clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The District Court of Kainuu will pass judgment on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Meteorological Institute, the same warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a seven-year-old immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19, and the relationship between the boy and the father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The audio track is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat paces.
Henry has had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he gives much thought to his relationship with his father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer chair or the beauty of cricket punching.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
The smelters are a little brighter today, but they are basically dark, smoky, labyrinthic depths with flames, smoke, and soot and reminiscent of the Sheol.
Father used to take a bath and just lay in the tub, and slowly began singing by himself while washing the dirt of the melting house away from himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked parental intimacy.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It was only when my mother began to get sick shortly before she died that we began to say to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter named Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes of the mother's death.
When I began to suffer from heavy obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult —
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may describe his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is absorbed in making the theatre.
The next shift was the comedy of the Mistakes and the Fences ("Aidat") of August Wilson.
Making the theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the business when he was only 16 years old, an employee of a factory.
A deejay spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-1970s. "For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to produce jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living stardom and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny in the New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people appeared as black makeup, so Henry ended up a comedian for the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Still, "British TV's award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment program" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in the 80s in another comedy series, where both a joke and admiring black British culture were made.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known, among others, for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with ads, documents, TV shows and movie parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series, shown on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just pedaling in your place or taking side tracks".
The next turn was the documentary series on Radio 4 "What's So Great About...?".
The first part covered Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not actually properly taught to us at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme sparked fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You go out with words and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry pronounced 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like some part of me was missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that was not exactly what happened.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead in the comedy of the Mistakes.
Suddenly I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, 'You must survive for 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stick to your role"
Henry in "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
Learning lines for the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was a sign from the gods, as it were; "This is what you must do."
This, of course, is what Henry says in a BIG voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little boys of humor keep interrupting our conversation as he changes from one impersonation to another.
Abstention from Stand-up Committee is a question of will, as getting immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you want it all the time, it can lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with a director who will help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting —
It's really funny.
When you show me a story, you keep telling me a story, and that's where I like to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya compiles a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive wages were announced in the Government Bulletin.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid wages after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on "ghost workers" salaries and other financial abuses in the month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left his official duties, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register in the next few weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data are stored in biometric registration format, reported in a government bulletin.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their positions. Furthermore, it will clean up payrolls at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of "ghost workers"," says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year of Seinäjoki may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budgetary preparations, the annual margin is running to be around 9.4 million in deficit.
The potential means of enhancing efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
Of the EUR 10 million reduction target, EUR 8.5 million is spent.
There will be no relief from the situation in the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, rising unemployment and a 5% reduction in central government contributions further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The city government is unanimous in the need for savings.
The ship must be translated into a strategy-oriented goal," says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the presentations made to the management team for preparation.
The City Board's proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through a board hearing to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "planning" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey suspected of "anti-government plots", local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to Hurricane Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officials were among the detainees.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a large criminal scale and following telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served during that time as Prime Minister) said that police action was part of an action planned against him and others in power by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a major day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastukkhov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter visits, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the libel tweet was unauthorized
A defamatory picture of a Democratic district attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Texas governor Rick Perry on Sunday night during his hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet where Perry vowed that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was illegally sent from my account.
"I don't accept the tweet and have deleted it," the later release said.
Perry's backup forces did not immediately respond to the requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who released the picture.
The first tweet contained a defamatory prank photo of Travis' District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The newspaper office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio who was assigned to the task by a Republican judge.
Perry has said that he is innocent and has called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the allegations and said that the law on which the governor in Texas's longest tenure is accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the State Department for Public Inviolability, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-wing monitoring group to make a formal complaint.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
After getting fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end in a draw by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself jogging on the lake with the text "Here Comes, South-Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's most important developers has warned that the housing market in southeastern England has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases while fear of a widespread credit bubble, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-level developer Berkeley, said on Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of stores have returned to normal since the 2013 peak" and added that this has allowed a "stability environment".
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought to reach the capital by herd.
According to the land register data, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus well above the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth in the previous year, reaching an increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the reinforced pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manor tax" before the May general election.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending regulations, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of loans approved decreased in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its 2015 forecast of real estate prices in London, according to which prices fall by 3%, as the index measuring the prices of homeowners has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen a quarter of the year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased the income from sold properties to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, correct product with best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained high".
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40% to GBP 380 million a year ago and net sales increased by 18% to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of the company, Pidgley reported that Berkeley's earnings for the year correspond to the market's current expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold photos of 100 other stars leaked naked photos of Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence online.
A representative of the Hunger Game Star confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for "poor violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
Images originally released on the 4chan image release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. The list of 100 other stars being hacked is claimed to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good mind," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and Victoria Justice of the "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand".
Let me put an end to this right now.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that the representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images about the star.
Only we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's praise for the new novel about love and the "J"
They dissolved, it pictured the best of what happened, gradually they detached from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that it was too serious, awkward, intense, detached, and perhaps also slightly thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was thorny, like a hedgehog.
The most recent victim of his spike had been an early relationship, however, that had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought some substance to his life.
Ailin Solomons had untapped hair and was a delicate delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from the northern village, which was even harsher and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older travel companion, whom Kevern assumed to be her aunt. The aunt had inherited a house located in a humid but paradise valley, and the valley was appropriately called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, weeds grew in the garden, similar to giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Reported by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening divisively to the receiver through which the whole country heard calming music and soothing news when Ailinn's crossed, sunburned legs brought to Kevern's mind a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and often heard by his father in the cabin's shrouds under.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They had not been banned — nothing was actually banned — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, like the word unhola itself.
Public opinion accomplished what laws and proclamations had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs, cookbooks, and romances of heroes, as far as music was concerned, they favored ballads.
As the day went wild, Kevern began pressing a fictional piano and singing a serenadia for Ailinn's big feet with an arrogant comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start out of your mouth with an j, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz had not actually been declared banned, it was not just played.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one if word.
As the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted, gratefully, the principle that each group did inherent things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of African-Caribbean ancestry are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their task was to make sure that there was a working phone in every family that was used to handle things.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When what happened, if it was true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not quickly fled in fear of being accused of torching the flames and fearing that the flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving Labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe, and continued to look at the ground and boredom.
Let each one act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words just sung by Kevern had ever been dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the bigfoots think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of giant cabbage leaves.
Still, Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was funny to my father," he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered the field of sight of Kevern.
Nothing to see in the whole world except Ailinn's huge, crow's black hair padding.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't exactly big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that way.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm by which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and at the same time knocked down the receiver and spilled the wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from Selyan flowers, so he could not use it as a cause for colliding.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your fat head is what I'm perversely attracted to you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unwarranted cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in a cold northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been like life here.
The same huge, cold sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though after the incident even more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and breaker grandparents, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to beat any woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
If he wasn't careful, he'd see a fat fist!
Imitate first – kissing had become the most common word describing erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote for meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern also felt that it was too much, for sucking was already hostile in itself.
Ailin Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the window upstairs — to a man who was himself responsible for his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten, who had lost all will to fight — why did he feel that that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that once before this moment he had seen such a thing?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the General Opinion measuring private institution in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in the country's areas where the reduction, or even the end, of violence was most likely to occur, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A great deal has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where despite the towers of the church that cross the hedges, human mildness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things should not be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people cry among sentimental ballads, devour stories of adversity and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-minded cruelty keeps incessant in its grip both rural communities and urban cohabiting areas, and there is also evidence of a new, evil-spirited fight in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatise," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum laid her eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you gay?
Esme further appealed to his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm opposed to atheism, lesbian sexuality, and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity in itself is completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, things you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil soul, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
SINGING WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened, will destroy the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-pink LED light proclaimed a guide that Ofnow had already shared with the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when she was sure her director had quit, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that led to SIIHE in the first place, what happened if it happened.
True, this time we do not shed our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz used his fingers to form a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "as you describe as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may have done or not have done.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and distrust on others'".
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we don't talk about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'us' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk more about it – that is something we agree with.
And just as it is unnecessary to make accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do so.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go over your report," he said and indicated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle driver driving on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil-souled and ferocious".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army denies planning an attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army officials have denied having staged an attack to overthrow the government and said that they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that his official residence had been surrounded by the army and took over government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him that he has received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics". Police have been said to have attempted to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are attempting to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America News Office.
According to South African government spokesman, Clayton Monyela, military action seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Force seem to correspond to the characteristics of a revolutionary attempt on all sides," he says.
According to Lesotho Army officials, soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of the actions because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have arisen in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies disdaining government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Trade magazine: Microsoft sets up a data center in New Zealand
The IT company Microsoft has established a large data center in a location in Uusimaa that the company refuses to specify.
In a press release sent by Microsoft to media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been placed in the centre's seat.
Microsoft completely terminates its Oulu office, which takes the job from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
The Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors tells STT that the company does not comment on how many staff the new data center employs.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data center in New Zealand.
The man is accused of assaulting a girl on a traffic light crossing

Gordon Stewart is accused of running a girl over at an intersection in Pittenween, Eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car recklessly and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78 from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different equipment options to choose from.
The preferred option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I myself took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and video camera have a setting to optimize underwater imaging conditions.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can withstand only 5 ft depth, others can withstand 50-60 ft depth.
Get to know both ordinary and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital cameras reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the picture can either succeed or fail.
So take a lot of pictures.
If your camera also allows branching, which means taking several photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when describing in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the less colors you can see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the photographer must be close to the target to fill the entire frame of the picture.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — protesters swear revenge
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters may not elect candidates for the 2017 election despite the increasing uneasiness of democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to long-awaited protests on the Hong Kong Business Quarter after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China gives communists the power to eradicate any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party, legislator.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that it would be too "caotic" to stand as a general candidate for the election of the Hong Kong leader.
As of 1997, with Great Britain handing Hong Kong over to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the nomination committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, the organizers of which have threatened to block the business neighborhood if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organisers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would generate protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they obviously did not give details, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online press release, organizers said that the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture to be the last resort to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and the taking of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has led to competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s lifeblood — the business world.
"The protest they talk about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people participate in it and how long it lasts," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want Hong Kong to get out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media has also featured stories that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the henchmen of the Western powers that incite revolution".
This summer activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region.
U.S. prom tradition strikes British universities: new students private jets
We are excited to respond to the demand by establishing Britain's first class of luxury travel for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable possible arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect of the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to their extremes.
When this is combined with many VIP features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet come because the service has just been established, but added that "students start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 per academic fee.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the university section of the organization, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority".
Many of their studies this month begin to be shocked at the level of living costs when the financial support available in the form of loans and scholarships has fallen short of the enormous increase in basic living costs.

Real estate agents removed the sales image of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig lies in the picture in the living room of the house.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located along a private road in Ipswich.

The protest by the Prison Workers' Association is also expected to involve members of the Trade Union for Workers of the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fans’ encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted in the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finnish victory today.
He was able to forget his black-black USA match and bailed Ukraine's second-half blood with his stagnant solutions.
But Salin passed all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so awesome.
In the eyes, there was nothing to be done.
That noise and the white public ocean was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments contained nine pins in a fast pace, ball withdrawals, discs, and tangled everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into the flow mode that it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere once in a while, now in an incredibly important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was great to see that the rest of them caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so no wonder his example raised the entire team to flight, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous ones remembered a serious judge game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the Argentina World Cup in 1982.
It is 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament than yesterday: it was a fire-hot match against France in the early part.
"In the resolution balls of that match, the judge game was glaring," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set on the backline.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went crazy more," Parkkali told us.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's champions, as the Polish World Cup will be able to take off on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball in 32 years.
The players' strength values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster than before," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to move on from the initial phase.
Then it can get tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Cricket
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on strike in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope this is the 17th place we're working on.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
The species legend Reino Kosonen was second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seaman Church were part of the national team's program at the World Cup in 1982.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all praise"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen reported in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
Many times I tried to lure and pull it forward a bit, but its legs just didn't carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel, or passers-by.
As the night went dark, the situation started to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campground when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells us in a message he sent to the Evening Sanam.
Soon a German man with a camping mattress came along.
From the mattress to Cita, they got stretchers like the ones the injured dog was attached to.
The German man showed up a moment after us, after we had wondered what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.
PHOTO: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down by a hiking mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain went slowly.
About an hour and a half later, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
The Sonics answered him on Sunday, but the German man apparently remains unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On the night of Monday, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They'd gotten some happy things from Mikkelsen: Cita said she's better!
Susanna Mälkki is portrayed as Chief Conductor of Helsinki City Orchestra
Mälk's three-year term would begin in autumn 2016 and end in spring 2019.
The performance also includes an option for two additional seasons.
He started his career as a cellist.
He is also an internationally renowned conductor and received the Pro Finlandia Medal in 2011.
Currently, John Storgårds is the Chief Conductor of the City Orchestra.

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth had only a few years left to live because she had a diagnosed second illness.
Actually, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth's disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motors, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe splintiness.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that as a child, I knew that I cannot do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
While Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several cuts in the Achilles tendon to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose my entire ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Baby girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT is, I thought I had been delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A Hundred Migrants Found in a Coal Car in Macedonia
The Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the country's Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they're going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesperson for the Home Office.
According to the police, migrants had paid about EUR 3,000 each to enter Greece, and another EUR 800-900 is added to enter Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel well through a couple of million inhabitants of Macedonia on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the Syrian bloody civil war.

Hull hired the attacker with a record amount of Hernandez club
The Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, Uruguay's national teamman.
Hernandez transfers to Hull from Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
It's a three-year contract.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and entered the Italian main series.
In the Uruguayan national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games from a switch to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
Monday, Hull also reported having acquired Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
The Russian space experiment failed - the geckos sent on a sex trip died
The five little geckos sent by Russia to reproduce into space have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos traveled on board the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
Satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finnish time.
The purpose of the test was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weight-free condition.
One male gecko and four females participated in the test.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on gekkos can be used to predict the effects of non-weighting on man while he is staying in a space similar to longer periods of time, illustrated New Statesma in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or cause of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, passengers crucified as "sex geckos" froze.
The surprise also tells us that fruit flies traveling on the same Foton-M4 made it through the trip without difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice Airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected to have been a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him down after he had lured a 16-year-old girl with money to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of the daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is a native of Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalising young people who lured Iraq or Syria into the wars also constitute a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France have travelled, returned to Syria or are currently planning to go to Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for the post are at stake when Finland today faces Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening defeat for the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the extension.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
On Saturday, Ukraine beat the Games in its first match of the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter quick guy, but we've been playing those before, and we need to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in yesterday's defeat to the United States.
We need to rediscover our own strengths.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal pack of wolves in the field," Mötölä said.
The alleged naked images of Hollywood stars are spreading online - some of them confirmed to be authentic
On the Internet, a number of nude photos are being distributed, allegedly representing well-known public figures.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked image campaign".
The entertainment websiteTMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a gruesome effort was being made for this.
I feel sympathy for everyone who was the victim of the hack, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice calls images going under her own name faked.
There are also genuine or fake nude photos on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Bet League.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match well reflect the confused current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a struggle ended in a 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not a bad defense game pleased.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and that is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed rapidly.
With the player roulette, many young players have also received opportunities they might not even deserve.
"Some don't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala suffocated without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"After the game, I said to certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player, and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately as players change continuously.
This season has not had the same lineup twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive head, there's been a change of people.
That is the main reason we are in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a seriesjumbo after a VPS loss, in tie points with the second last TPS.
There are seven more rounds left in the betting league, so the Espoians still have time to avoid falling to number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop it now.
We're definitely not going to fall out of this show," goalkeeper Viitala ran.

View to how wolves howl (even): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
I had a great feeling today.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 after Finland had played against France in the European Championship at the Marouss ballpark in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when he was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted at 20,000 spectators, otherwise an empty hall noise.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match.
In Bilbao, there are eighty times as many troops of 100 Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships was a time of search for Finnish basketball.
The men cleared their way to the finals by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Mötölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä with lime lines to the rest of the tournament team.
A solution on which many disagreed.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, although not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, there were reportedly just over 100 Finns present.
The group included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
Whatever the number is in there between, it's an inconceivable amount.
This is explaining to sports sociologists.
In a global world economy, businesses move across borders.
There is still a chance in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go to see how our girls and our sons are successful in the world," says Professor Hannu Itkonen of Physical sociology.
Surely both in Spain and in the volleyball World Cup there are Finns in Poland looking for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
That still doesn't explain everything.
You have to be attracted to sports, too.
Crying makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports games than Berlin to watch art.
But without success, you can't get the masses moving.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top-notch sports professionally.
Almost ten years went by.
Then the direction changed and national team action was raised to the pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media have taught me what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can sports of ballball move this massive interest into domestic series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played on average for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
Crying thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
Another school believes the interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn't want to have a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not twice interested.
It's a challenge for companionship in the middle of the rush.
For the Bottas property, confirmation - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake's shore
Nastola rewards formal driver Valtteri Bottas with beach home plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the disposal of 1.4 hectares of land at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, the property will have a leisure residence.
The success of Bottas has been followed in Nastola since his karting times.
He is perceived as a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
The area has seven buildings in order to be demolished, of which six will be demolished at the expense of the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas reached formula 1 in the Belgian sectional with his fourth podium this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in his childhood in Villä.
He currently lives in England but visits Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come, but I don't think they come to the poor.
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition currently underway in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by field ball people, but also by amateur Marcus Giron, one of the top college players, wears one.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mocula on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the mound acting as a central unit is removed.
The fashion house has not told you the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at the price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in intellectual clothing.
Athos, California, has introduced a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and their thumb size central unit costs $2,100.
The technovates were also written by Red Orbit.
A Smart Way to Save in Textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students from later years borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling books straight away.
"My mathematics book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use throughout the semester as well as a crowded sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia's state.
Schroeder reports that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university's board of directors, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, who runs over 250 campus bookstores, the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookstores last spring were rental books," says Trevor Meyer, president of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus bookstores.
This is the simplest way to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is nearly $290, but the book for the online store of specialty books Chegg.com is available at $239.99.
Buy Used
The books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be accessed from the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's senior year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used from the Amazon.com online store for only $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls School, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes reforms in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found by a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
Renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting the "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Read about the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the charges resulting from the use of the highlight pen and the consumption of the pen.
Renter, beware: If you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book's purchase price.
E-books
It may also be a question of obtaining e-books instead of ordinary papers.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for the right to use the e-book to its holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store offers the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
Comparing the different sellers pays off, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon begins at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it allows you to make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in storage, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain the book at the full price of the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in fires of fire compared to last year.
According to media surveillance by the Finnish Salvation Organization (Spek), 55 people have already died in pieces in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11.
According to the association's fire death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses, and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of reviewing home fire safety.
At least all home fire alarms should be secured according to Spec.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire-extinguishing equipment is readily available.
There must also be an accessible way out of all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use while alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter- summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the Blue Mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after being overnight trapped in the Blue Mountains in the New South Wales region of Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday for Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The family became concerned about young people who had not returned home, and called the police at eight o’clock in the evening.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent to search for young people, and the two were found at about 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with a couple and were brought to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian Army, soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army spokesman, the gunfire on the other side has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, a Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits yesterday, off southeastern Ukraine, sank in the morning, reports the Border Guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard didn't know where the ship was shot.
Separatists already told me yesterday in social media they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, today's Minsk negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
Firstly, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars under themselves.
On Sunday, authorities estimated that it might take some time to stop the flood, even though the rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains were caught by surprise by the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance about the rains.
The on-call meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Meteorological Institute estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" against the difficult socialist president whose composition of the new government did not win the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay with him," Valls said and earned applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the controversial 35-hour working week in France in peace, despite the controversial proposal put forward earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused dissension by appearing at a meeting of the socialist MPs who expressed dissent and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the ongoing disunity between the socialists and said that he does not believe that Valls' new government will last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to disband parliament and considered sure the election victory of his party in premature elections and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held a listhead in the May EU elections.
According to a poll by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of the Hollande season in 2017.
The political researcher at Po University, Pascal Perrineau, warned that the French will soon lose patience if the new socialist government does not succeed in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that the change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka cheated on the good morning on the recorded share of Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Vila, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda.
The Morning Finland program released a fun video of recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Mooja and Nina Rahkola, as well as meteorologist Pekka Pou, are trying to record the good morning Finnish adpuffi from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite straight.
Alm-Vara goes crazy in her words when she tries to recite the word budget rhyme, and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their cheeks time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live again tomorrow, good morning in Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has both been liked and distributed on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the picture office, finished third in the pottery series in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
On Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, a Socialist International meeting was held at the Building Masters' House in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and the background were right.
Right away, I realized I did it this time.
From the look on Meir's face you can see that the Middle East leaders have had a difficult time before.
At that time, you managed to do well with pictures of known people or events.
It is great that other images can be successful today, as long as there is an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation already cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department of Drugs has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This was assessed by Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation for the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the lawfulness of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the IT systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time allows comprehensive judicial control.
The doctoral dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken foods belonging to the Kasvisdiet"
The picture of a special bulletin on the school wall of the Pirkkala women's trip caused food to rise in social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there's meat on the list will we make a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15 - year - old bulletin that was forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread in social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, chief of food and cleanup service, tells Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came here, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he states to Yle.
Today, at Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian food option only with parental permission and a medical or health nurse's certificate of vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetal experiments may leave their nutrition incomplete and the lack of meat or chicken can cause wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near the $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is conducting negotiations to buy its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The information comes from people closely involved.
With the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) as it continued to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public, because negotiations are not held in public.
Norwegian Cruise and representatives of Prestige Cruises did not respond to comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based from Miami, has 13 cruise ships whose route map covers North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when turnover was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami as well, sails with Oceania and Regent brand names including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the year before.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in the middle classes of emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the number one choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first stock issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current lineup following its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting accounted for 28 per cent of the company, Apollo's 20 per cent and private equity company TPG Capital LP's 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of North American cruise capacity by Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise is 82%, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The City Board of Tampere will address the issue today.
Animalia hopes that the City Government will support the initiative in a solid way.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalian, a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, it is worth ending quickly during the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, the view has become more widespread that the retention of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal-protection nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to reach Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an issue of animal rights, but also the issue of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
According to judgment hazard, the death of Nasi-delphine strengthens the demands for a dolphinarium shutdown.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Dolphinarium of Särkänniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphins' prison, and start finding out how to move the Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a sort of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara requires.
Your nose did not have time to return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have more to live than a non-inspiring concrete pool, Koumivaara hopes.
The Animal Protection Association Animalian aims to ban the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act under preparation.
The dolphins are also included in this group.
In support of this request, Animalian Executive Director, Tuomivaara, will participate in today's 1.9th demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
At the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki, a demonstration takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Mr Putin insists that Kiev open negotiations with the new country with East Ukraine
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the resigning region," Russian news sources report.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners corresponds to his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government in practice to grant the newly declared Novorossian independence which allows it to head for Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian Army to reclaim the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was taken over by separatists in March and April after Moscow joined the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the area as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term resembles the days of glory before the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that planned peace talks are "an illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the 26 October parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately begin extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is linked to wider independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need," Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine."
The interim remark by the Kremlin representative to correct Putin's comments "false interpretation", stressed that the Russian regime handles the separatist revolt in the eastern regions differently from the one in Crimea, when it virtually took over an area with a majority of the population of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
It would be far more difficult for Moscow to even annex the Donetsk or Luhansk territories in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russians and because, according to pre-conflict polls, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the Russian main fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the Russian region between Rostov and Crimea, which produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that are not from the core region of Ukraine as regards their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists perhaps armed and incited by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putinin made his latest demand to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded East Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the beginning of a larger effort to seize the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to massive civil and military reinforcement of the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port town located between Novoazovsky and a narrow area of land leading to the Crimean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for further action to prevent the future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there will be no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the Ukrainian region.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the creation of additional sanctions to be put in place if the Ukrainian crisis flares up in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian Armoured Divisions and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk area last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilvaisk was traded to 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in the Ukrainian region a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda already in the seventh game minutes.
At the second half, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez from the penalty kick.
Laziokin got a heavyweight after his narrowing goal at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of Milan's former attacker icon, Inzagh, San Siro Stadium was only half full.
The number of audiences in the match was announced to be 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the nude image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by the hackers, perhaps after his fiancée was stolen and naked images of the Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been teeming since a series of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were released on the Internet as a result of a large celebrity image hacking scandal.
Hacker has been said to hold a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Game Star Lawrence and other superstars, including the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunsti.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Grecko, who live in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in connection with an iCloud leak.
The list has the names of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, who is in New York City, is reported to have commented on the incident in the online magazine "as shameful" and said that the victims "feel disgraced".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer at topless pool edge.
Palmer's film earnings include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told the TMZ newspaper that "there is an arrogant violation of privacy in this case".
Actor Seth Rogen became angry with a hacker in his tweet: "The release of images stolen from the laptop is no different from the sale of a stolen product in any way".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like their home field and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba at the volleyball World Cup.
Check out the photos of the fan drug.
On Monday, Katowice of Poland was white: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, Finland's victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters.

That was the big impact the fans had on our game, Finnish captain Antti Siltala said to STT.
Finland was already losing 0-2 in the match, but rose to win 3-2 in the win.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle rise from behind six points.
Cuba already led a batch of 16-10, but after that the Finns became enchanted.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when a charter aircraft could not land in Katowice due to a heavy fog.
