Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "People should have a right to their own body"
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the ceiling of the Project Room gallery at the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
Papers tell a multi-annual story about how outsiders have written down their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you a person about my medical history in order to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
With the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a years-long research period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to diagnostic studies on "gender identity disorder" conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the Internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process so that gender can also be corrected legally.
The Transjugation Act, the Act on strengthening the gender of transsec sual (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to get the right sex into, for example, the Population Register Centre and passport.
At present, every gender-repairer is required for a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
It is the right of a person to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
Translaw reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight observations on the law and there is a precedent in the European Court of Justice, which obliges the parties to the ECHR to respect self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared the amendment of the law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister for Social Affairs and Health.
There was an election and the Finns Party rose to the government.
Now the legal amendment is stuck again.
These are domestic political disputes which are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government about amending the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty's Finnish Department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One consists of the packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient account installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist at the Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report based on these, which would define the treatment of Auer's right as well as obtaining help.
The consciousness of the reality to be studied appears exposed to wavering.
The subject's perception of himself appears fragmented in a borderline way and the unstable personality features are highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," says Auer.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex correction treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting lobby of the transpol.
Later, a work of art was created from that television called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone who is defined as a woman at birth can magnify their breasts, but to remove breasts needs a diagnosis," says Auer.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything more than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not unique.
The gender correction process is harder for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Its participants meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy for people who need support and help to be denied treatment, citing that their resources are not enough," says Auer.
Many people who have entered the process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On these grounds, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Prevention of treatment and aid can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began," says Auer.
Auer's personal exhibition also discusses anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition release, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, feeling better.
He had finally been able to write the feelings that had existed since childhood and teens.
Why the wide jaw did not seem to fit your body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a steady chest.
The important thing for Auer is that there are people around him who see him.
To be seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments by loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when people who are close to you are misgendering.
"They should know and they know who I am, but will not agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhuman beings need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and the long research process, there can be no official confirmation of their gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," says Auer.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-time applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he or she is of a different sex.
After a period of six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new identity code.
This self-determination is also required for Finland and this requirement is also summarised in Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphalic Dick 4-28 July 2017 at Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
The NGO issued a travel warning to Missouri
A travel warning has been issued by the Afro-American Civil Rights National NGO NAACP for Missouri due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"NAACP's Missour travel bulletin enters into force on 28 August 2017 and calls on African American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state where numerous questionable racial events have recently occurred," the organization's press release states.
The recent law in Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to justice, and the implementation of state laws is disproportionate to minorities, which, according to the NAACP, led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and beaten or killed," Rod Chapel, president of NAACP Missouri, stated to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The travel bulletin for Missouri is the first warning by the organization regarding the state of the United States.
The organization cited examples of racist comments made against African American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and he was arrested by the Missouri police, although he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be careful and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare, for example, by taking money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, one hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, or the sixteenth highest among U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws requiring police to arrest people for immigration violations. According to the organization, this increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and apply to other states, but recently have been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
The Minister for Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä (centrally) has asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, says Yle.
According to the minister, it contradicts the state's will.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by the wealth centre emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on the supplementary pension for Vauramo in February.
Finnair reported that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
More than half of Finnair is owned by the State.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's corporate governance principle decision.
The sanctions immediately made the speeches harder
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia are on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 meeting in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted in Russia.
The most stunning answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the sanctions law signed by Trump means "a full-scale trade war".
Even if Russian reactions would only be offset by political rhetorical escalations and excesses, there is a fact of tightening the gap between the United States and Russia after a short honeymoon after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passing of the sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not a simple matter.
Although Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, it was reportedly far more difficult for the President to adopt the law.
Trump therefore criticizes the law he has recently signed as "significantly inadequate".
President Trump's arrogance must have been particularly caused by Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting his own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into the possible involvement of Russia in the presidential election as well as Trump's campaign on Russia connections.
The tightening between the U.S. and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandal-stricken twists have almost been revealed, it seems increasingly that foreign policy is not being made in the United States under the leadership of the President, but despite the President.
This is certainly not a desirable situation.
If the relationship with Russia is Kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the Minsk Agreement to be implemented.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy towards Russia, on the whole, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State that trades a lot with Russia such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, the impact may be felt by the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and possibly by the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidification in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions of, for example, the U.S. economy of an important liquid gas ing.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
Economic sanctions must, however, be well thought out and vigilant.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
To intervene in statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
The Americans know it as well as the rest: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideals of Trump's administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a verbatim about the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not actually criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge packs of cruise organizers and figures impersonating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the meaning of the statue, and especially the addition in 1903 of Emma Lazarus' poem — 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is how Miller brash Acosta: "I don't want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong as such, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of its kind in which the state not only invites immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your Tired, your Poor, / Your Huddled masses yearning to great free, / The written refuse of your teaming fire."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller certainly did not practice literary criticism, making it clear that the "poor poorest" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus ’ friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal. They knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouther who can now be considered some kind of sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is an early forerunner of neoconservatives, who takes the torch of the United States to the world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty comes forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and weary but hopeful immigrants after a long and trying journey on the deck of the ship.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want under any circumstances.
Their torch does not show the way but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots made the UK national team
Neil Black, executive director of the British Athletics Association, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "substantial confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting on Friday in London.
According to Black, in Scotland "there is something special happening", which British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what is at stake," Black says.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the union's activities,
and the British Athletics Association believes that it is behind their activities.
And the average street walker thinks he must have something to do with it.
However, this is something absolutely awesome, whatever it is that is caused by it."
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-meter run. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly magnificent," Black says.
"Sporters left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had genuine feelings and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in the 400 m fence race, and these are his fifth world championships. He thinks it's "unbelievable" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five British and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London. He is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, including wins in the UK World Cup Qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "powerfully proud" of having so many Scots involved, some of which seriously compete for finals and medals.
"It's a great honour to be a captain anyway, but it's even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I'm of course very proud of all the Scots that made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for the prize.
My captain's speech?
I thought it was all right.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Do not run for public office if you cannot stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics always to his political principles.
Criticism must have annoyed me.
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as foolish and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The United States Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff consider the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also understating online.
"What's the difference? This is just Facebook," a lot of people commented.
But it matters.
especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a state controlled by Democrats.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hothead.
He has been a firm leader of the state and has held firm to the principles.
He has also used skilled Facebook as the main channel of communication to his constituents and there released a picture of a balding head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users who enter the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintain with tax assets.
Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, who said it was just a matter of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and proper.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news", he wrote in comments from the Washington Post news.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organized group in some way and are ignored as a large group by concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "centralized attack." Another might call them the promotion of things considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
But the real thing is the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to have been accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users prevented by President Trump have sued him.
A first major decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
According to James C. Cacheris, judge of the District Court of Alexandria, the Loudoun County government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution while blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights League went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postages had a similar effect to today's Internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls back then.
Nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers in which they barked at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions critical of Jay's agreement, the United States-British cooperation, trade and shipping agreement, as shown in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen locations, and additionally online announcements of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also individual from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, according to specialist Marja Isomuru Evira.
Greens have died of parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It's been known to hit pigeons in the past, especially the pigeon.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in finnish birds.
In 2009 it went off real good.
At the time, tricomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch stock, after which the species' stocks have been recovering.
There have been sick green finches now, but at least not on a large scale," says Juha Honkala, museum champion at the University of Helsinki Museum of Natural History.
It is feared that the last outbreak of green finches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: to stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field representation at Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field representative for the next three days when Renaissance Club in East Lothian holds the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led a tournament next door at Archerfield Links before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and serves as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is the keen ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great demonstration event for this field."
Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour in his 32-year career and a European challenger tour.
"This seems like a very special occasion," says a player living in Southport.
"I was unable to defend my Extremadura Open victory because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to the real thing on his own soil, and he went on tour after he was 50 years old earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Playing in the home area is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio will be able to accompany former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty to the field.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to the Prostate Cancer UK cancer organization.
In Säkylä, possible indoor problems in the barracks were investigated
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found at least so far in the Pori Brigade communication company barracks building, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Inland air studies will continue.
The studies began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to bad indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Brigade of Pori, no problems have been identified in the health situation of the other garrisons.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and other servants in that unit have had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
The Brigadier's bulletin states that the July arrival has required the transfer of goods to the barracks, which may have allowed dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed to be stuffy because of it," Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
Bardina Degei does not use the stove in cooking.
He doesn't even use the kettle very often.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the batate – locally "not" – directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred sweet potato is devoured with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually does his daily chores as well, such as laundry in the muddy water fetched from nearby swamps.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of his four wives and has not been assigned fields to manage.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the village's men are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dares walk into the village after five o'clock in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annex was preceded by a controversial referendum, where 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which holds the region under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and bleak. The journey there begins with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a belly-wrestling five-hour drive by a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
In the town of about 19,000 inhabitants there are wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with corrugated roofs with rust dyed to yellowish brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have these clothes," Degei says. He means his colorful handwoven tangled sheath, dark skirt, and brightly colored blouse.
"Before we had nothing but leaves blanketed by our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 percent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesian goldland.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey, a highland area with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometres from Pania is Grassberg, the largest and most productive gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, for they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
The demands of Papua for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 the Indonesian army has killed over 500,000 Beans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the Papuan Highlands in the 1970s gained proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful demonstrations.
In a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything for 2016, there are reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means – and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to count because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened when Papuan natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the Province, 83 percent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as Indonesian people from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes migrate to the region in hopes of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut sauce.
It's hard for the locals to compete.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at cheaper prices than the locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the provincial capital after work.
"Local women lost their clients".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Yokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to tackle Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta presidential castle.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," you say.
Paniailla experienced some kind of low level just two months after the Yokow October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire at Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers didn't like the remark, and according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports from the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A couple of hours later, a government electoral commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to take place.
About a thousand Papuans — young men and women and children — met at the football field in front of the local police station and the Army Command Center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for ceremonies with them, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in the ring and imitate the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere became hot, soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident leader in the Kego Koto area, sensed the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to me anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly colored wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers.
"In the crowd, multiple shots were fired".
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," told Yohanes TIME magazine saddened. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police only "protect" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
Knowledge of the killings came to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Yokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising that violence in Papua would be tackled.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that no such thing will ever happen again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he began to recant immediately.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he was not going to start studies in Papua.
"It's all settled in court," he told me.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". Crimes relate to the death of over 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai have a dark disbelief in their claims.
"I have been interviewed four times over the past three years, but things have not progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this already."
He continues to say that he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army is going to arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm going to get shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians dare not discuss the event.
He reports that he had been assaulted by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring region of Paniai, Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the manager refused to take a man who had lost consciousness to the hospital. Among the injured were children.
The man who needed hospitalization was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been watered while fishing in a nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police say the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, causing one villager to be killed.
"We're terrified of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development fuels discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live on Papua's lush midships.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels claiming to defend the rights of the Beans by occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian Army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arresting and arbitrarily imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of "the safeguarding of national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees will never come back.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
Enarotal has little rice for sale, and that too expensive for the locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the income of locals and migrants have increased and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Few beans have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"The young do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The outlying Papua will be ignored by the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua even though they had been granted a rare filming permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Phelim Kine, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency or contributed to development by removing the restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting from the troubled eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, have new risks: visa refusal and blacklisting," Kine stated in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from neighbouring Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "number and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
A spokesman for the Indonesian State Department, Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia remains a democracy with press freedom, so covering up evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says the anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
There is a presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the Beans tell us that they are no longer likely to vote for Yokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in Paniai's shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Yokow to know the situation of the Panais: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, practically without health services and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Panai, like the rest of the Beans, consider their votes to Yokowi as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of Paniai's shooting once more showed opposition symbolically: they buried one of the victims in the land across the street from the police station and the army's headquarters.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks about the cancellation of Robert Helenius' rematch: "Even their own fans don't want to see"
Robert Helenius of heavyweight boxers and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 in the Hartwall arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent IFL TV interview, Chisora rolls the cause of the rematch completely onto Helenius' shoulders.
My match in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks, Chisora rudes.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial scoring conviction.
The ticket sales for the rematch went subdued, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told the Evening-Sanam in May that the match has been postponed to autumn.
Since then, there has been no news of the match.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora became ill.
Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I needed surgery, Chisora says.
The British says they are currently in about 45 percent condition.
From the looks of it, he's not interested in a rematch with Helenius. He's targeting Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with scattered sounds.
Fire took over the Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames took over the highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from a 79-story building 337 metres high.
This was the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire had no idea immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up with a fire alarm out loud and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai emergency services, the fire was extinguished by fire at 4 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced that it would organise accommodation for those who left their home.
The case may raise again questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building's Board of Trustees commissioned a study to discover that the most damage was caused by plates used for façade cloaking and insulation.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cloaking plates of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid advance of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between 9 a.m. Tuesday and 5 a.m. Wednesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was marked Sky Team Monkey.
It's red in color, and the license plate is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, reveals survey
A survey for air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items to aircraft past the U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other items with blade that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% reported having only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The poll was answered by over 1,000 passengers and was carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters chartering airline. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers knowingly violating TSA rules were members of the Y generation and less than 15% belonged to the X generation.
Most commonly, the rules were violated by bringing food and liquids to the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted that they deliberately took items with blade to the aircraft. In addition, 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported that they had deliberately taken banned drugs to the aircraft.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many smuggled goods had accidentally passed a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that those who travel the most are also most likely to pass through security — knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company who conducted the survey notes, TSA's instructions are rather complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken into the aircraft and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquid.
For a time there was also the belief that books should not be taken into the aircraft.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, rolled over his decision to delay Obama's decisions to reduce emissions during the Obama season
The day after 15 states had sued U.S. EPA leader Scott Pruitt, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's administration to reduce smog emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he manages takes better account of the needs of state environmental policy makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the suit against his previous decision had been filed before the Federal Court of Appeals.
The states should start to comply with the ground-level ozone standards for 2015 as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he will postpone the implementation of decisions by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere in local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a public prosecutor for the state of Oklahoma before he was appointed as head of the EPA by President Donald Trump. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to mitigate regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama ruling on oil and gas companies, which required companies to monitor and reduce methane leakages.
In a statement made on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his turn on the ozone rules only strengthens EPA cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on time.
"During earlier administrations, EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected that activist groups and others would sue it to reach agreement on timetables," Pruitt said. He sued the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous operation.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneidern, the New York State Public Prosecutor, who led the EPA's federal alliance that sued this week, said that the group was going to continue the pressure.
"EPA's change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneider said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people; it is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to have a guy in charge of our breathing air used common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight against Trump's regime, as its ideological aim is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups."
From the manufacturer of supercars coming to the street SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while striving to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari's style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans at an information conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of East Savo measles of the same type of virus
The measles infection in the coastal Strait is the same type of virus as the previous cases in East Savo, reported by THL.
On Thursday, the Department of Health and Welfare's Virology Laboratory has ensured that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same strain of virus with previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a beach-salted person has the same type of virus as the previous East Savo cases.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have no other types of measles virus.
It is possible, however, that new infections can still occur between mid-August and after the fifth sufferer, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over," says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for basic health care diseases in Soster.
Since the fifth confirmed case, no new measles infections or suspicions of measles have been detected.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date," Erkkilä reminds us.
More about: Three new measles infections were confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for an authorised act of screaming
Pontika's soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
Based on the argument that the process produces methanol in addition to liquor, which is toxic.
Preparation of the scream at home will be legal next year, but legalizing the moonshine soup will not even be considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The reason for the regulation of distillation is that the process produces not only liquor but also methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to turn the moontika soup into everyman's right, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the Pontika was not considered to be legalized.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distilling," says MP Outi Mäkelä (C.E.).
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups in the government parties, who took a stand on the reform of the alcohol law.
You can't even grant permission to distill a moonshine at home in the future.
Commercial manufacturing is also subject to authorisation.
Importing tells us that there is a simple rule for home making alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be produced by visiting the home.
This means that in addition to beer, cider, and wine, you can make legally screaming at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of the scream, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or flavouring and flavouring ingredients produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
According to the new law, drinks can be made for themselves as much as they like, and self - made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must still not be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland," Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were liberalised.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The bill on alcohol is now under review by the Department of Justice.
The Alcohol Act comes to Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session will be held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspected heart attack.
Pistorius is already out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville Prison.
According to British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The prison spokesperson confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examinations.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family, on the other hand, reported that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literary phone conversations reveal Trump was pressing Mexico to build a border wall
Telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged the Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speech about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States beat Nieto for having knocked out the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also released a littering of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, there was a tense exchange of words.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is "stupid", "stupid" and "stupid". According to Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama's period would make him look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call by stating to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day long."
Georgian Massacre: Activists restaged racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury brand car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards a small Moore's Ford bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the team, a middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and stares through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---o!" man sputters.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-stage that aired on 22 July 2017.
The sighs of shock, however, are genuine when the noose is placed on the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to rearrange events of 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been charged with murder.
"It is disconcerting that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with resembling arrangements.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs upon our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia Congressman.
For him, re-enactment is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the perpetrators to go to court. We want things to be concluded at last, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make amends until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news, over 50 men were suspected of lynching Monroe and surrounding counties.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives for lynching have been known to the locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed by the Supreme Court to vote for the first time in the presidential election. The Supreme Court issued its ruling in April, and the election was held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred at the time of the election, in which black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the town was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid the $600 bail from Malcom against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The mob stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI report states.
"It is also evident that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a suffrage murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote".
Cassandra Greene has been directing the resembling of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The motion is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many people would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show, but it's even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsal of this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – about a dozen blacks and twenty whites – met to listen to Greene's routined summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local leader of Ku Klux Klan in the remake for years, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
"I feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history also be held up so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, train their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester. He is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I said get out of my country, n---o!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the punch.
And then everything (at least all black actors) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the hard way.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene laughs.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n---u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is occupied by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene begins again.
Now, Rascona's words are sensitizing.
No one's laughing.
The re-run will end quickly and violently.
Screams, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in black funeral costume stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few ten yards away, about fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
Almost half the audience is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to watch a performance from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have visited Brooks's graves in Georgia's oppressive humidity.
Murders have become real from the story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played lynchers take off their capes and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors meet for a dinner together.
The white couple who arrived from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when describing the feelings raised by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible deeds that people say and do that look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"I was made to notice that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He already tells us that he started planning next year's performance.
"Rerunning is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Vegetarians in stores are baffling: This is what it really saves by removing the "extra parts"
Is it permissible to remove cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
How about taking off a big hat piece of pineapple, that weighs a lot?
The answers strongly share the opinions: for one, it is an indication of an extreme snooze, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that do not use and yet go home to the garbage.
The phenomenon is identified in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department of Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear the leaf pieces of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste in the store.
According to the news published by financial messages, sniffing at a vegetable counter wonders the merchants.
But how much does removing the excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How important is the sniffing technique really at stake?
We women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take off leaves or stumps.
Cauliflower: the price of the cauliflower paying EUR 2.10 came to EUR 1.80 when it peels all the leaves out of it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple paying EUR 2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 as its stock was twisted away.
Globe artichoke: EUR 2.60 per price came to EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Sweet mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost EUR 1 and without stock 80 cents.
Final result: If leaves and strains start to pluck off, saves a few cents at best for one vegetable.
In terms of percentages, the cost of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of EUR 1.20 from these purchases!
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - a Brazilian star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously the record was on Manchester United, who last summer paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League held off the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the rules of the league, the purchasing club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his own contract, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He is possibly introduced to a new home audience in the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa examines the details
Barcelona also stated in its press release that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Federation Uefa in order to enable the association to determine possible disciplinary action in the case.
Among other things, the president of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG is violating Uefa's financial fair play rules with its use of money.
Uefa can punish a club that makes more than EUR 30 million in losses over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial lines.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players with substantial amounts of money, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.
Ten-shirt for Neymar
Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike, the flash was recorded on the airport security camera.
Austin Dunn was doing regular work operations for the aircraft at the Lunch-Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning bolt from the rainy sky struck the plane.
The power of the Flash threw the plane to the ground near the wing of Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and told me my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I'm just asking if he's alive, Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a cerebral hemorrhage.
The experience was hard on the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to an airport spokesperson, the lightning risk warning system was on-line at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when it launched a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly made at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of his third savings programme to revive the business weakened as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House publishing house to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for this year unchanged. Its turnover increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and amounted to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, where officials say the attack killed a NATO soldier and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, Thursday evening's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan Army patrol was attacked by a "personalized explosive device".
The opinion reported that all injured were stable and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the strengthening of Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where mainly Shia Muslims live.
The Taliban reported that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in downtown Kabul in a bombing which was the most devastating attack by a militant faction in the country after US-led forces overthrowed Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA rounds its decision to postpone the implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revolved around its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's administration to reduce smog emissions the day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "Otonimisations" of 2015 late on Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is proof of its commitment to cooperation with the Länder.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," director Scott Pruitt said in an agency statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Agency to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year until October 2018. The definitions indicate that smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollutants need to be reduced in line with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including District of Columbia, which stated that delaying execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate environmental regulations in Barack Obama's day, and according to Trump, these measures are part of a wider economic growth programme.
Trump's actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to EPA website, inhalation of ozone-containing air "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person in the leading figures of ISIS had also sent building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspicions were that the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't give you any details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-discharge device and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian federal assistant commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue as well.
Managing Director of Fluid: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Liquid's profit before taxes fell, but hit forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the operating profit for the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will complete the strategic investments we announced earlier in 2017, Lievonen said in the bulletin.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a possible match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomayenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of under 66.7 kg, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won the showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five weight class boxers on the comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven Saturdays.
When the duo posed to photographers, Lomaschenko manager Egis Klimas remarked that the men-to-men match would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm a former featherweighter," Garcia reminded me of.
"I moved the series higher [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He's got to get on the lightweight [61.2 kg]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing Needs This Match".
Klimas asked if the match should be held on a pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomaschenko to debut in a lightweight series later this year and fight Garcia next summer (37–0, 30 knockout wins). Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell fight in a lightweight Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on the payline because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
As soon as we get a deal, I'll be fine with it."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as a "unbelievable fighter" and he was perhaps going to go see the Saturday match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's guise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was focused on first showing the impact force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being sought more and more.
"This is the fight we're waiting for.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he was waiting to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage 5 300 euros, education whatever happens - the situation in investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talking a lot lately.
Last time, Helsingin Sanomat told about Ritva, 68 to whom the investment advisors of the banker store spoke total nonsense about investment products when selling.
The rules for investment advisors and various sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new MiFID, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define competence requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service perform its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees for a company called APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, where experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry are present in the Qualifications Working Group.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Ltd.
Its website reports that in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, approximately all providers of investment services have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 degree, as they are mandatory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose personnel seem to have avoided completing their qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" banker shops like this.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by 13,000 to 14,000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees recommended to investment advisors by around 3,000 people.
Some bankers consider a degree to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that a recommendation from the financial sector requires APV degrees to be completed, because it is then that knowledge related to the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, benefits in kind and performance fees.
The average working time of monthly-paid workers is about EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in jobs earn over 5,900 euros per month and women over 4,500 euros per month.
On average, the tithe of those making the most earns about EUR 8,100.
The tithe of men who earn the most earns more than 9,000 euros a month or more, one tenth of women who earn the most make 6 400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
To date, self-regulation has been relied on at the level of employees and tasks.
According to Fiva, its audit met individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were insufficient on the basis of the advice's activities.
In principle, even at a low level of skill and competence, you can also sell investment products.
From this point of view, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have significantly stricter competence requirements," Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up by the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that each undertaking is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, will be given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, the market supervisor of Fiva, says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is the regulation on the requirements of the expertise and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to investment firms' own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that, according to a government proposal submitted by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably be given the authority to order knowledge and experience.
What they are exactly will be decided with these prospects during the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, where necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty of proof that this has also been done.
The court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, chart the staff's job descriptions at individual level.
This will certainly have different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the Court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
In other words, if a company hires a new employee who does not exactly meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "pilled" a giant aircraft over the U.S.
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in the Flightradar24 service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday 787 with a Dreamliner aircraft, with which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
A plane from Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 km in 18 hours and 1 minute, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. borders throughout the journey.
It flew a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s persistent beach swimming school students are not dazzled by rain or sunburn - Iines Kaikkonen polski persistently with the help of a swimming pool
Iines Kaikkonen progressed well, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run on Sludge and Lempuka for this and next week.
Even though it rains and then shines again, the young swimmers aren't too bad, praises swimming school executive Taina Itkonen.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children will increase swimming skills, a dozen next week.
The number of children of the coming week was influenced by the fact that school and eskari are already starting at that time, it is assessed by Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the beach in Slette had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimming school students trained to stay on the surface with swimming owls, someone without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first thought about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged her to pedal toward the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen told me he had been swimming a lot this summer.
She likes the silt beach.
Like Liines Kaikkonen, swimming with a swam bar village was persevered in swimming with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today's achievements, the swimming instructor praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again, wanted to go to water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6 from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learning swimming.
No matter what the weather has been, Anna's been happy to come here every day.
Sometimes you had to warm up.
Swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
Boys had a lot of work to do with a frog found on the beach.
Billion Lukenen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked fruits and baked the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry at the pier.
The kind that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a connecting story"
You see all kinds of things.
The Blue Product, which makes cleaning products, launched the Unknown Military product series a few days ago.
I mean, dishbreads and laundry racks, and a wc brush on the edge of the brush.
The unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of his premiere in these fall.
However, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been detested in social media: When will the Unknown health ties come?
I have to call the company and see what this is about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Blue Product, say?
We're the film's collaborator.
We're here to support this film, like a lot of other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," Määttä says.
According to him, the products become a special display of the shops, and the film thus gets visibility.
Isn't there something funny about this... often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products," Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports the same basic Finnish values that are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning up is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, Hartwall's vichyt has been introduced to the market, for example, by Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
The unknown products were already shown by Kalle Kinnunen, blogist for Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's premiere, so there is still to be an extension.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail supply chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes, has not yet revealed their war products.
The new results of the age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. However, the results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensics started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after criticism of the Swedish Immigration Service for failing to define the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far conducted 6,880 tests, and the Forensics Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
Eighty per cent, or 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over 18 years of age. Furthermore, in 25 cases, the Bureau of Forensics determined that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson of the Bureau of Forensics reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no large differences in the statistics of the previous months," he told The Local magazine.
Although the majority of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "referencing that the subject is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly reported that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of the wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joints, then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, and has also been criticised.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinic Institute, whose work involves assessing human biological maturity. The evaluation can be used to determine whether a person has become a teenager earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure of age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Bureau of Forensics defended the accuracy of the tests: "You can generally say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, at which point the risk will be about 10%."
Joyful collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilosen's section 30 with a result strips down in the European golf tour race in Scotland.
Joynen left number 11, divided to Saturday day, but was found at the end of the round sharing number 41.
In difficult weather for joy, one double bog was collected to accompany three Bogs.
The others were having trouble too.
The Englishman, Ian Poulter, rose to share the top position in one under the par round, although he said that there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
The reel was raw, but I hung around and eventually the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top position with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia changes party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he would change party.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflections... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Democratic governor."
The crowd broke out with cheering applause.
"Tomorrow as a registered Republican Party member," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1,59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement on Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather build barriers than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party with no leadership of any kind and unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel stated in a statement to CBS news.
The lightnings have sown the damage - from Thursday becoming even the very thunder day of the summer
At the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also be available in Southern Finland.
During the past week, there has been a thunderstorm especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Varsinais-Suomi region.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
According to the Meteorologist, Thursday may become the most thunderous day of the summer so far.
The thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has been particularly felt in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the poo, lightning struck the electric center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna space at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department unloaded the roof and wall to find fire bases and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven housing units were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
In the Loiland, again, lightning set fire to the outside building in Harjuland before midnight.
By the time the rescue department arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue department had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding about 50 square feet [50 sq m] wide burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä, lightning struck a detached house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The rescue department came by to check on the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information on the defect was obtained between 8 and 9 on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses in the meantime.
The problem was not fixed until just before 5 in the afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunder-stricken section of the track.
Lightnings have caused devastation across Finland.
This summer, however, has been relatively low.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely miserable! assessed by the on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen of the Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms of Wednesday and Thursday have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, many feel even strong.
This might seem like a really tough thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like with this summer's thunders, says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the dirt lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential even for the summer's toughest thunder day: by about 16 p.m. the plaque had 1,790 earth lightnings.
If the lightning continues to the early evening, then more than two thousand lightnings can be achieved, Tuovinen is predicted.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the year's lightning volume was about 30,000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18,386 salami.
So there is still some catching up to do to keep this year from breaking the "record" two years ago.
But the thunderskin can be expected to continue.
According to Tuivinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for thunders.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to be on Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
There is going to be a more unified rain front in the central parts of the country.
It's the kind of guy that says it's only a few thunderstorms.
Coe praises Russia's "open" apology for the doping scandal
World athletic boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made for the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end the Russian ban on participation.
Russian athletic leader Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday on the eve of the World Cup that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he plans to fight resolutely against doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away in the competitions with a gold or silver medal".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban. Russia was excluded from athletic competitions in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report had presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open-minded performance," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Association admitted that the country had been going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfying" that Russia accepted the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the Group's recommendation that now is not the time to stop the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
On Monday, Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Task Force, said that Russia still needs to meet many demands before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate, and the banned coaches continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after his presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with the poor success of Tom of Finland
The Tom of Finland film did not become the success the authors hoped for, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, confessing that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview with the CEO of Helsinki Film.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that's what it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film's budget, about EUR 5 million.
This was no lottery win, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distribution, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by the UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play economic rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its star guard, as the following funds the dynasty enriched with Qatar's oil.
The clubs may spend large sums on acquiring players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that the football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for the fair play were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platin, a Frenchman elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by indebtedness was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a worldwide brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair play economic rules will run until 2018. During this period, clubs will be allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave UEFA president's duties in scandaluously in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will apply them also in the future," Andrea Traverso, in charge of fair play financial regulations at UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it may amortize the amount in the accounts for the full duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, allowing the transfer amount to be recognised as a EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
Based on the economic rules of the fair game, the first sanctions were handed out in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a EUR 60 million fine, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit the Champions League to its group of 21 players for the 2014–2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies related to the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal level of the market, the UEFA does not calculate the aid as the actual result.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatari Tourism Authority for PSG was excessive.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be financed by fees available to the Organisational Commission for the 2022 World Football Championships in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the Organising Commission have denied that Neymar would be involved in making an ambassador to the World Championships. UEFA would be very easy to reveal such an arrangement.
As a result of the previous sanctions imposed by PSG, UEFA is even more closely following attempts to circumvent the rules.
On Thursday, informed sources reported that UEFA has not negotiated a transfer of Neymar with PSG.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation in the PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the 2015–2016 period were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit exceeded EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with Neymar's agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to be transferred, allegedly violating the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," the Spanish League president Javier Tebas said to the Spanish AS newspaper. In the state he referred to the Qatari ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the football club's activities. Arsenal is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of a fair game. There are so many interests associated with the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now we have to hurry: Finnish World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three defector Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach at the World Athletics Championship in London.
Kristina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti competes tomorrow in the long jump qualifier and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three-loop qualifier.
However, the two-man coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in Britain's major broadcast unsuccessfully.
The coach has an invitation from World Cup organizers as a documentary, but also has not qualified to obtain a visa.
I wonder if this is one of Brexit's first symptoms, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As soon as someone at the stadium looks at the stepmarks, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible exit.
The World Cup Medal for Finland from London requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championships begin in London today on Friday and lasts for a fair week ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the kind of sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether success comes or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there are other gauges.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value race to another, where by acquiring experience, the athlete’s performance is matured to the level that the adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes on the Finnish small World Cup team, although there are no co-conkarts.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that even miracles can happen.
It pulls bench athletes to the television screen and glues to follow the games, although the London medals are not solved until late in the evening due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The Uskalikos expect a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the results of his and other throwers' recent events and the Pitkämäki stay in the qualifying race last summer.
No matter what happens at these games, Pitkämäki will be in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, admission to the final or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finland's athletics for the coming years will give a good success in the youth international championships this summer.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both training and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that the London Games will end up in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah's Games, not, for example, because of the terror or cowardly attacks of terrorism.
Enni Ruka Lake second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, United States.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The women's race was won by United States Jamie Anderson.
Lake Ruka collected 147 points in the competition.
With his last jump, he attempted caballerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and I feel good right now, but I'm sorry the last jump didn't go quite well.
From now on, I'm going to try it again at the games, I think Rukajärvi.
In the snowboarding big air, the contestant jumps out of a jumper made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship stalled in Helsinki
The new express ship FSTR of the shipping company Viking is very late for the schedule.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was a loading on the ship about eight o'clock.
The ship came to Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get aboard.
Now the car queue moves a little, Estonian Johannes Rebane, waiting to be boarded at the port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there was a technical malfunction on the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting in their cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that there was a technical failure on the side.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says the ship will also be late for Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.
A 42-foot special transport disrupts traffic at Six-way on Thursday night

Police control traffic on Sixway, and traffic may be stopped at times.
Transport from the wetlands will proceed along Route 13 to the port of Mustola.
Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story gleams simultaneously with the days of character's 80s glory and the grunge of the 90s (in those days David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant series of The State sketches for MTV) as well as their own time – 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the show moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both parody and a description of the constant recollection that we are stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived through its time.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (that was reported, among other things, by H. Jon Benjamin's voice, speaking the background story of the vegetable can).
The essence of the joke is that middle-aged actors play horny teens approaching adulthood. To highlight it makes the impossible to reach the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys e.g. 90s stalker movies, such as horror film The Hand that rockes the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (who is aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in shows like this, the best are the sidepaths.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who under the lower lip has a beard-tup, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from Singles. Andy, the king of the camp, played by Rudd, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may raise this series to flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series' Cold War Spirit, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series' wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The starring hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef are seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Cornelius Ulici. Their lines have dubbed in English Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
But that's all it is.
The series has some good visual jokes (police spend time watching chess on television in the same way as Americans watch football).
There are a group of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. Their bong is a fun game.
However, Comrade Detective is caught too much in the imitation of clumsy socialist drama – a killer hiding behind Reagan mask, for example. Therefore, the show often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the humor of the series is neither quick nor abundant enough.
Condensed, the series might work better as a Agitprop satir, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and the lobby always have two fat men devouring hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as well.
Toni Tauru, from Kouvola, rises into the ring on Saturday in Macau, facing a former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa still fought in the UFC organization last year.
Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once in my life, I'm fighting an older man.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
The Kouvolan was supposed to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made on a quick schedule for the Chinese Autonomous Region of Macao.
Tauru's never encountered anything like that before.
This was the first time my fight was canceled.
It annoyed me, because it took a lot of time to prepare and practice.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date has been set for the struggle.
Waiting for a week doesn't have much effect on preparation.
The transfer won't affect the condition, because it won't improve in a week.
It can get worse if you practice too much now.
In his last few struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths are in standing.
This time the situation is different.
The Issaa Kouvolan describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he'll come in the first round hard and try to take you to the rug.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The last fight in Kouvola didn't go according to plan.
The Philippine Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the corner of the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing: he never got a hit.
When I went down, he hit my corner of the eye.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa fought the last time in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we are facing the second struggle of this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I've been working out and in good shape all along.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old found out about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the scenery for a while.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing it back.
We got some really good practice when we had a guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvolan will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a standing match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit it sensibly.
If there's a chance, I'll go myself.
Sub-exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts the Tauru previously fought in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great evening ahead.
The Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been inexorable and inflationary inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to slow, shifting interest rates due to increasing pressure on family incomes.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6–2 votes to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that households' income levels are under increasing pressure because inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb inflation accelerated by Brexit, and the bank announced that loan costs may have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the commission decided to cancel part of the massive economic package that began a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost funding to banks of £15 million more, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Protocol to the Bank's Interest Rate Decision states: "According to the forecast by the Financial Policy Commission, slow GDP growth will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" to curb inflation "a little wider than the market's expectations".
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that possible increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and a growth of 1.7% for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5% and was $1.31. Compared to the euro, it weakened by 0.4% and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to maintain interest rates was taken after weaker than expected growth rates dampened the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and according to the bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it improves.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" a fall in income over the next few years, but expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be reinforced by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound; it will reverse some of the effects of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shock of the EU referendum, which pushed the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will probably not be reflected in prices and the economy until after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the Central Bank, interest rates had been increasingly demanded as inflation tightened the pressure on households, with three decision-makers calling for a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation reduced last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June. However, according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its 2% target was 'all' due to a weak pound.
"In view of the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market appears to be further strained as creditors frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is about to end; renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no-use options."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial anti-HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed a "reversible" anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the funding of the medicine in the English public health care system (NHS).
NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to sexual intercourse, a drug has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's judgment last year, which states that NHS is able to pay for the PrEP medicine, although it claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
On Thursday, Simon Stevens, director of the NHS of England, called the announced decision "a significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to start accepting registrations for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be used before intercourse with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
You can take the medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates who qualify for the test from men, women and transgenders and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolling in general medical treatment can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the English NHS signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, administration and implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing versatile and increasingly effective ways of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It's yet another major achievement in the battle of more than 30 years in solving one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says national AIDS leader Deborah Gold.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those in need and at risk groups, it may have a reversal effect on the English HIV epidemic.
As of September, those in the high-risk group will receive a drug through an experiment funded by NHS that they can decide independently on its use without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have a empowering effect that will improve the lives of a great many people.
This was welcome news."
"Now is the most important thing to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one in the risk group is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP medicine used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event, which lengthened unnecessarily in several months due to government slow-down," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a revolutionary effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get one step closer to the situation in which the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker enthusiastic about the renovation of the properties, moved from Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house like Queen Anna's era, and the success of the renovation is that Joanne has not yet packed her things and moved.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to this apartment show and found that the rooms were as high as my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete deformation.
It was a two-way apartment where the bedroom was only accessible from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired from the Duck & Shed Planning Office in Erfan Azad's Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of rooms nearly four metres tall and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate layer that could accommodate standing.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The structures are quite complex.
The farms had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to squeal.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right on top and under."
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
The middle floor opens a copper-crossed window in the stylish lounge of Retmaurus.
Mirror-golded furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage luminaires create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, space feel and light.
Mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem real longer.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's meals and glassware.
It adds to the style that you can hide the kitchen when you're not using it.
Kitchen with folding door is not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is raised up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning," Erfan tells of a steel veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, so it slides very easily when you put it in place."
With rational space use and storage design, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and a better layout.
"When selling the dwelling, the area determines – or the value of the property," Erfan says.
"In principle, the real estate agent walks in to the apartment and lowers the price based on area".
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The dwelling is in contact with the materials of the dwelling, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly created on the basis of them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to electric wires running through the walls.
They are also important but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic dwelling exceptionally fine.
Then it may also be that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's choice of costume hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before she was born.
For dinner at the A Sustainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia represented the event with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad of Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body late outfit that dressed a wonderfully pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived for the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representative event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His due time is in September.
Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress for dinner, which landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The pastel blue did a great job on the princess.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week on a representative trip.
Sofia filled her costume with a little bag.
Sofia was really radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited at the event to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia said laughing and referred to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a booth appeared in the market in Lahti where Thai food was sold.
The Bayans did not dare taste, but walked by.
In the booth, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, and Finns did not yet know thai at the time.
Since people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
Thus he taught the bayers to eat Thai food, a spring roll at a time.
Taste the land, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai canteen in Lahti's commercial hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 customer seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and have limited seats, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
Little by little, we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat by the plate with the dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by at the store hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because the spices made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new seat was opened at the end of the commercial hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most crowded times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows his clients.
He'll be told where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He has seen how customer life stages vary and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat the first spring wrappers.
He remembers me when I was skinny and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my own seat next to the kitchen door and change your belongings with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many speak to him in thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
He goes to the restaurant. He goes to the mushroom and the blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, it was this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security authorities gained access to a list that was important for the fight against terrorism.
The list contains data from more than 170 Isis fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 persons and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each person.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information contained in it have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, special forces in the Iraqi army found a list of terrorist identity and images while investigating an underground base of a terrorist organization in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information on the person's country of origin.
The list also contains a breakdown of terrorist specialties.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There's no more detailed information on the man's fate.
In total, around 6,000 fighters have left Europe with ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
From interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person was rescued under water in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, on-call firemaster of the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
He was found under the surface by a rescue department diver, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a report after 4:30 in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the emergency room.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a mission led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also excellently guided by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars collided in Eura, nine people in cars, three seriously injured.
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, says the on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around four o'clock in the day.
The crash occurred when the second car turned from behind the warning three in front of the other car, says the on-call firefighter.
According to the emergency services, there is a 50-mile-hour speed limit at the intersection.
Brothers fight over $500 million for real estate property
Two brothers argue over Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth over $500 million, a dispute related to a family business established 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak rank only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute over the distribution of property and business assets between brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, jointly own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on properties, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the carrying power and central figure of the family".
According to court records, the distribution ratio of assets means Colin owns real estate worth about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was first dealt with last Friday in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says that the claim is not true, that he blames Paul for mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution.
"In line with our Italian tradition, family is the most important thing to me," Colin says in his statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports that are being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as one of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy stores in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in harmony.
"Luigi often stated that he doesn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. Colin said that Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "the bitter of the economic conditions of their departure".
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League Society Board and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he said in his text that he couldn't really comment on it, because it's being discussed in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family's name into a court battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin went on to say that he still hoped that a solution could be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff is going to restrict the President's use of the media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the media use of President Trump and the follow-up of the news so that the boss does not get in so often trouble.
Reporter Josh Dawson reported:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with management staff on his first working day, he brought up a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit the information of President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information – printed as well as those heard at the briefings – must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he receives good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television — and as president he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump became nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media dealt with matters more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an advisor in Trump's campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign workers, it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that her personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise".
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter would ever have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know – perhaps Trump's tweets would have been even more fierce without their efforts.
We'll probably never know what kind of messages Trump didn't send.
If even a few times his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
Part of the problem is that there are rival factions in the White House who try to push their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher reported on a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can be enraged enormously by newspaper clippings that criticize him – especially if they tell about harmful information leaks – then he is absolutely forced to know where the information comes from.
That happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news from GotNews.com, established by online provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later withdrawn them. Nor did he present concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started the case after reading the story to ask staff questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had attempted to introduce a system of managing documents going to Trump".
And what was the result again?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona was therefore dissolved and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
The sum of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
Previously the record was on Manchester United, who last summer paid EUR 105 million for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by the state-owned Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis pro, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaif.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
A success writer, Raija Oranen, backed up alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm fine in my life"
Of the TV series, Rose's time and pure white sheets were celebrated by success writer Raija Oranen.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold their grandmothers in such grip along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now there was also a rental apartment leaving in the spring.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Rajian was once driven by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external being is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight went off when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mood drugs.
Alcoholism once helped me with hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the blazing author says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling together for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who worked in the tourism industry, have been travelling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen she has always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who has made a major career as a writer, remembers only a good 44-part clean white sheets of TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided that the company of the Raika family was in the clothing industry when I read Alice Seppälä's 50th-year interview on the plane.
I was myself the daughter of a seamstress, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I was a model, Orane recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the show changed the attitude of Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it," Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts working on - ideas for hundreds.
The circlers returned across the ditch to the "billionaire alley"
One of the wealthiest houseowners in West Midlands is once again hair licking with persisting orbiters who managed to cross the ditch needed by the municipality and return to the field adjacent to the houses.
Circuits parked their 20 caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat needed for the municipal procession, bringing with them children, horses and the army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused Solihull Municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
A resident remaining anonymous reports that the Travelers came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-bys.
"The municipality needs to be tough on action because it seems completely unable to solve the problem.
The orbiters were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them in the evening and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"Aun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when a municipality can't do anything about it".
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travelers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even landed a horse to graze in the park".
According to a spokesperson in Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
As far as the collection of evidence is concerned, it is vital that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to create an overall picture of the situation for trial."
The enraged people surrounded the Portuguese crash machine
In Portugal, men who had landed on a beach full of people have today been questioned in court.
Two people were killed yesterday as a result of the forced landing.
Two men flying a plane may be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, at its longest, you can get 16 years in prison.
A small aircraft flown by men had to make a forced landing yesterday due to a technical failure on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.
At the time of the event, there were hundreds of people on the beach, some of whom ran from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane hit the man who was on the back of the plane first.
Immediately after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told the newspaper Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
Those on the beach surrounded a small plane right after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating its ass, reported the incident in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash landing.
The tragically lost Finnish star of his leg won World Cup gold again: "If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finnish time in an early Wednesday morning in a race held in the banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
Greater Hamari also won the Cross World Cup earlier in the Games.
In all, three World Cup titles have already accumulated.
It's a pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice treated with gold, with a pretty good heart rate is pulled, the Greater Hamari reached by phone rejoiced.
A 30-year-old counter commended his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greater Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole para snowboarding has grown and developed so much lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
There seems to be a different winner in every race.
Greater Hamari lost his other leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had been enthusiastically descending with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to enter the hillside.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in saying that.
Those cards play what is shared, Greater Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and lose a limb as a kick in luck, and Greater Hamari does not do it.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I'd say it turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a triple world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Greater Hamar's greatest surfing enthusiasm was already fading.
The job towards the top didn't really start until after the accident.
When I was a kid, I was training with guys, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself somehow in the X-Games Start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be embittered and sad.
I decided to pull the overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The counter was very pleased by the choice of wheelchair bowler Leo-Pekka Star as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize at the January sports gala.
According to Greater Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for the parasports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch the two-time world champion Matti Greater Hamar's Year athlete campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Still Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he coveted.
Next year there will be a great goal.
In a year's time, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We'll go there and get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees roasting bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen to allow them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen to bring about a change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication office chain Burson-Marsteller explained the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth in nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees survey investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February to March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18 to 24 were responsible for the survey, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents may think of returning to their country of origin and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the young people's decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in a permanent return home, while one quarter considers that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the population will make the most important factors affecting the decision an improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
The Syrian youth were asked which factor is the most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
The President of Al-Assad is considered by a quarter to be an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Only about a quarter believe in resolving the conflict by military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS's power weakened over the last year, while the fifth feels that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would inform people that ISIS had nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures and educational reform as a priority.
In the opinion of just over a tenth, the most important thing would be to create more paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of Trump's regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during Trump's administration.
Nearly one in four believes that the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's period.
Opinions are divided as to whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the internet in order - the database he is developing is used by such people as Wikiped and Google
The Espoo-based company MariaDB develops the "fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, established by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users absolutely nothing, and can be developed via the Internet by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge data masses are kept in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, acting as the Technology Director of MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
The man who works remotely from Kauniainen helps to make sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun purchased MySQL for a billion dollars, and a year later the software giant Oracle devoured Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise of the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired twenty of Sun's best developers and thus made sure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch from it.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar store, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, Director of Economic Affairs of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's key figures.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million in orders.
As the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps exchange databases, which may be more than a year's work if the client has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB can be done overnight because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small firm, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even some central bank", Paqvalé's list.
Database markets are still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Oraclelle's MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although, according to research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still negligible, although rapidly growing, sinters.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach one billion.
However, the value of open source cannot be measured only in money, since most users pay nothing for these software.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would then have been switched to open databases or at least the transition would have started.
Large companies do not get new customers, as the majority will next choose open source.
This has led to license fees for commercial databases being jumped to the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius ponders.
Since changing the closed database is difficult, most customer companies have swallowed up price increases loyally.
"There are a lot of customers for whom transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed in the closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer's measure is getting full.
When licence fees rise each year, the customer will sooner or later transfer to an open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes.
Moreover, many companies are already facing major system changes by transferring their activities to cloud computing.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now intended to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB's funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros per year from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed by how Finland spends money on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source code is ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that cannot be invented or done by themselves.
The 55-year-old Widenius is among the best known open source promoters, along with the second Finnish developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies develop operating business models over open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy is intensifying its attitude towards non-governmental rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations, which use their vessels to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea, that they must not continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Minister of Interior Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized the German ship of Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers to promote illegal immigration.
For only one year, the aid organization refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in a statement published on social media.
"We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet vessel since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who regained access to the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred only a few miles off the Libyan coast, as shown by the prosecution's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area, and the motive is the zeal for aid.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue activities have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which stated on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they did not entail "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize Prize for Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, stated that with the rescue measures, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, as he sees as an indication that measures to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees going towards Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected of being killed by his common-law spouse at Enontekio, a suspect found in the terrain - a case for the prosecution
The suspect's crime occurred in Enontekio's Kuttase last December.
Police say a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish common-law spouse.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also reported that the suspect, after his actions, had fled with two dogs in the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and he did not resist when captured.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
The case may still be discussed in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and All Hairy Friends series, is dead.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at 91.
On Thursday, the actor's death was announced by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also played in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role in the All-haired Friends TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was shot for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to prison for texts inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were considered to incite the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, carries out 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at the Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the sentence and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed with a crying look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
According to Carter's lawyer, the incident was caused by "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level or even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The prosecutor read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, in which she told me that "it will not be a day before I mourn the death of my dear son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to get through all this. I'm trying my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we're always going to be carrying."
Conrad's sister Camdy Roy told the court that she is "haunted" by the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never goes away," Camdy said.
The case appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in the car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had induced his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hide yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times released Knox's opinion paper, in which he states, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
Military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of NATO on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the East Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not strain itself.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to find that the gap between the USA and Russia was even dangerously poor.
Trump urged to thank the country's poor relations with Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to a setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update over 350,000 car software.
The BMW manager said that the company believes that "there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve CO2 targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing emission-neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of complying with major car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed fraud devices in cars that reduced emissions to compliance with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the Audi engine development department, in charge of thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, where authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system to circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the producer of luxury cars accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The Venezuelan vote began a fraud investigation, big protests in the pipeline
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election result, the chairman of the National Election Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, told reporters.
Maduro convinces the crisis to end
On Sunday, in Venezuela, a controversial vote, a representative body was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of appointment.
According to El Pais, the nation's national security forces began on Wednesday night local time to take over the country's parliament building.
The troops are intended to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease - carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Laventeli is indeed endangered in Provence's region because it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years. As a result, rainfalls in spring and especially in autumn have decreased clearly," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Institute of Agriculture, Provence.
"This shortens the lifetime of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought many small cascas into the area, spreading microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists and is also a highly desirable ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether, instead of long-running stars and large flowers," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil than before."
The solution is sought by stepping up irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The murder of a journalist embodies a growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the once-a-weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases related to organised crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children home or taking them on board for delivery, which was attacked by grenades in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking reporters to name names for each group, and there's no need for evidence, no need for observations, no need for knowledge.
The painting is written with the names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on government or drug cartel payrolls, criminals who make Mexican chaos a life-threatening newscast.
According to the Editors' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. Under federal protection, there are 589 journalists who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states in the current year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, editor and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture with Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture says "Right". 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a branded panama hat.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoid fears.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established, particularly for the handling of journalists' cases, but according to the Journalists' Protection Committee, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists rarely face justice, as well as thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists are going to continue writing about violence in Sinaloa, although they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little benefit to a security meeting because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is frankly a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why the event happened."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan in the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota just a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The amount is supposedly related to the title of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left in mourning by a wife and two adult children.
Rumors move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is silent.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the void.
Someone or several people are shot dead on the streets of Sinaloa daily, and there are two-storey tombs decorated by drug barons larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is "peaceful" when only one cartel dominates ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce released an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a rival faction that waged war against the sons of Guzman.
The case may have angered the Guzman boys: clients suspected of being members of the gang bought each issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another magazine published the same thing was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when in 2003 he decided to set up Riodoce with five colleagues. The shares in the magazine were sold at that time for $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to become familiar with its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the articles in the magazine that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the Journalist Protection Committee's International Press Freedom Award for his courage to follow Mexico's story of drug trafficking without letup.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to go on with my life," he said when he received the Prize of the Journalists' Protection Committee.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The editor must accept the task that falls upon him – or act foolish.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce’s staff miss Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always received a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routines got to him.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"The offenders will not like it if we deal with their women and children in our cases and their clean business activities, their secret drug trade runways.
They were left out of the story," Bojorquez says.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is, according to Riodoce's journalist Andres Villarreal, that "the impression can be deceiving, and that was the case with Javier".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where the riodoce safety training was held. It had become apparent a few days earlier that only government spy programs had been used to monitor activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some reporters half-played whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited mountainous rural areas controlled by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
Boxing greatness Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that government spending had focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecution's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public records that the restaurant was registered in the names of a politician belonging to the ruling institutional revolution party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about earlier cases in the same place, one of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the military raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column would provide reliable information on the kidnapping.
"Previously we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" due to his slim physique.
"Now all connections to our sources of information are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse to store signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The magazine's employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when she left the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration due to another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoaca three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started protesting more loudly throughout the country. In protests, "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he tries to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked that he be moved away from government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, criminal permitting authorities, and indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 control group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were made by police and authorities.
"In Mexico people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
There was a note signed by his body by the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my writings."
Next to his dismembered head was the computer's keyboard and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Some continue their activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to drug cartels, "What do you want with us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and we must be on guard at all times.
Sometimes criminals sought out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — once to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking is frightening.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, the editors of Riodoce sat on Friday at midnight in front of delivery on the sidewalk with a beer when the latest issue of the magazine was completed. Suddenly their phones began to vibrate to mark the message.
In a shooting between rival gangs and security forces, 19 people had died in the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the messages from the cartel found in the area.
Journalists put the news on the Riodoce website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
I had to remake the front page the next day.
The sirens howled nearby — another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even think about stopping the operation. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked me to get on the street to do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "The tough spot"
In April, the festival of Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season began disastrously when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It began a long period of illness that stretched to nearly five weeks.
May went virtually completely ill.
At first there was the flu, and finally there was a childhood disease such as an ear infection that I had to take an antibiotic course.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It was tough when I couldn't take advantage of practice, Manninen tells the Evening Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the 12 June Race and Top Sports Research Centre KIHU's roller mat test.
In the test, the athlete skis with rollers on the carpet, whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall, I took 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
There's a wall coming up, Mannine tells me.
For the better
After the understatements, Manninen tells us that he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week episode.
Midsummer also had a week and a half leave of flight duty.
My family and I had plenty of time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen took part in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race when Manninen rose 18th on top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan up until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm over the last season.
After the First Snow Games, Ruka would have a three-world cup race weekend.
In December, the intention would be to attend at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans should still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic team list," Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympic Games would already be the sixth Winter Olympics of the career for Mannise.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummel underscore that celebrated gold in the team race in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur sheltered himself from his enemies by disguise
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first results of research on a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problem with the past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of all time and the world's best representatives of its species.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists view this amazingly well preserved fossil as a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, an armored vegetarian is the best fossil ever preserved in his species.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a 1,100 kg block.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you squint, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will remain in the history of science as Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The studies of the skin found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, although it had an armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor masked it from predators, and was also protected from darker and lighter coloring from the top, which continues to occur in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to headlines in May, and is now exhibited in the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, Mitchell, who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and the international team of scientists have been able to determine its body scales and armor patterns and shape.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by general coloring, where the body is darker and lighter from the top.
However, the observation was surprising because Boreape is considerably larger than the current animals with similar coloration.
It suggests that the dinosaurs who eat meat preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of modern animals, deer, zebras, and armadillos, for example, have similar coloration, much smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous were," Brown says.
A chemical analysis of the nodosaurus scales of organic compounds reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including examining its bowel contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted to sea, where it sank to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas likely extended much further than today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has survived and has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost like the early Cretaceous
It doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little bit, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The Cretaceous Age was the era of the Theropods, huge bipeds, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Boreapelta, its mighty predecessors may have been preying on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaur, a six-ton-long monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, believing that Boreape washed into the sea after his death and mummed in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium Mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with its skins and armour from snout to hip.
Nodosaurus averaged five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two six-foot spikes were raised from their blades.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through modern Western Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor has survived into small details in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains in armored dented plates along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as a lottery win.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull armour still contain fossilized leather.
Its right front leg is on its side, five toes upwards.
I can also count the scales on that foot sole."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment, browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street".
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. Therefore, he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death, who had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri State.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that people would gather on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police lock-up tapes and screaming people as well as the man who claimed to be Brown's father, with a sign that said, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video footage where police stood in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another cop tuning his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers he did.
"It was not the kind of murder we are already accustomed to and could be termed typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a flight home the next day.
The plane landed at 11 a.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter at her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
For what happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years, a documentary film "Whose Streets?" has been made. It premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and tenacity from the point of view of the local people who went out on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson in a flower dress and her daughter dressed in a crown compatible with it, they re-interviewed "what it is to live in black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't leave my daughter with me," Ferrell later told me.
"Today's events are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow into it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black man, and he needs to know what we need to do to be freed, to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like the rest of the black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, located opposite the police station, becoming a campground for activists while they waited for information on the case and eventually learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My Aktivism changed completely after August 9th," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the minority nursing student organization. At that time he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan in an evening demonstration, an assistant director of the documentary.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell you" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind got suspicious, and he said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story you can use?"
The reason for the doubt was the countless times that people had appeared in the local community, usually whites, who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan reported recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The film crew followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how local people are portrayed in the film because I'm being portrayed in the same way."
According to Folayan, it was not intended to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was wanted to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community". Ferrell, however, proved to be the most transparent to be described.
That's why the documentary shows surprising private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the film for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human portrayal of black people require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and re-emphasises the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police had shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with the queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has sustained the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including many queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-intentionally" due to his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that she was on the front line. Black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
The news crews have left Ferguson long ago, but the relationship between the community and the police is still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway in a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate of his hometowns is short and concise: "The mix".
Still, he still trusts the slogan he memorized on Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose is our chains."
Suitable resemblance: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery, located in New York City, has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with a face — white, black and brown faces that can be seen more closely with a resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence Barack Obama relaxed his tenure on the third last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analysed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical statement on the modification of DNA data, ambiguity and the underlying cause-effect relationships and identity.
Chelsea Manning, named Bradley Edward, has openly told her that she has identified herself with women since puberty. She was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud, and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black-and-white selfie, where the uncomfortable Manning sits in the car at the driver's seat. He wears a platinal wig that became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had behind him in 2015 a project called Stranger Visions, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, which gave him DNA data on cigarette butts and gums, for example, and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told a new exhibition at an information conference.
They couldn't visit Manning, and they couldn't shoot him in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he'd be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence buddies, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It depicted a future in which the president would have reduced Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a fortunate coincidence after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now when Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leaks and transgender soldiers and is still inventing new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions that he had to actually mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has its purpose."
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's great autograph, where the heart is the point of the surname i. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "an automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
There is a DNA sequence of Manning on the opposite wall: a long line of C, G and A letters written with a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotide, as is the scientific definition used by the artist – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic data are very personal and open to interpretations," Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also features his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of them on display here".
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg comic book.
In it Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they'll have won," says the picture.
"Never shut up."
"Text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I'm still getting the chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is purposeful, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at an altitude equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces were previously on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the mass movement Chelsea generated, which was also behind her release".
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being sought for murder as a suspect
Police report that they launched a national search to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County Court records show that on Monday warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. The warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released from bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is investigated as a murder, and police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president responsible for social relations at the university, stated in an e-mail that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is banned from accessing Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
A statement sent by the University and Somerville College spokesperson by e-mail states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are prepared to assist the investigating authorities in the United States in all possible ways."
The opinion also reported that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Information for the Chicago Police Department, said that he is seriously urging suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we continually refine our searches," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help find suspects.
He reported that the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the sight at the scene as horrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras revealed Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following press release to the residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
The man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must complete 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kills all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of aggravated harassment.
Police say the bookstore staff alerted them on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threated to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims".
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore's events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
As a punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay £620, i.e. approximately €690 in legal expenses and £85, i.e. approximately €95 in compensation to the victims.
According to Scotland Yard's spokesman, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete WADA road map actions in the near future" — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA Road Map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
"Part of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD of the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Road Map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the powers of RUSADA. The second part of the Road Map was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything worrying for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the alleged role of the state in the doping of Russian sport.
To that, Mutko stated, "The investigation is under way because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words contained echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov, who spoke earlier that day to Russian sports media RSport, admitted that there have been problems with the Russian anti-doping institutions. "We have said several times that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
The WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA leader Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organization was "on the right track" towards restoring powers.
British organization skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: "There is no evidence of health benefits in maternity packs"
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights against cockeys, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternal packs distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will be started this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of cot death.
The death of a coca means an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust serves as an expert on health authorities in Britain in the safe sleep of a child.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed in them because it would suggest that we recommend this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in the world, only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for certain," said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity kits are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cohabitation.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given free of charge to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of items such as children's clothes.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The package itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for sleeping if no cradle or cot is available.
The organization recommends that the packaging be used only for naps and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and making sure it does not get wet or dirty.
The quick villain escaped from the Japanese zoo for the second time
The staff at the Japanese zoo are looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo via the main entrance.
It does not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is a female, 55-pound, and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to travel freely in the garden area.
The zoo hasn't had any eyewitness sightings of the turtle.
The last run-off of the villain took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your attempt to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure employees' satisfaction in her online shop start-up company, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions simply were neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to rely on outside help.
More and more new types of personnel management start-up companies have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target certain teams and groups, provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and in some cases direct contact with the board of directors.
"My own health can be followed by applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint offers companies analytics software to measure employee commitment.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He tells us that he has gained a deeper insight into the ideas and feelings of his employees.
The programme can be used to conduct rapid surveys and votes for certain teams, and to draw up a map that can be seen at one glance, in which departments the workers are most unhappy and which leaders have received the weakest estimates, which have allowed Errett to drill into the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. Ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups such as Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, can reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently concluded a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct tailored surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report improper behaviour anonymously by SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect that the manager is wrong, the complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"General opinion has displaced authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has used Convert for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
Previously, it was the practice that if an employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out a phone number or e-mail address to report to the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Attorney General James Vitrano. According to him, complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"By the same token, we will protect our shareholders from labour-related litigation".
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical action in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies understood that they could no longer prevent public clearance of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convert offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture investors. Both Glint and Convert support venture investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received EUR 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, business culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Workers are more committed to the company's success if they like the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn, the company responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors get a return when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information on employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on that basis.
If the company requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered a sign of change.
And if change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting company who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company does not take action, employees will begin to wonder if they were heard
and does their opinions matter at all?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently conducting personnel surveys monthly and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from workers frustrated with the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands her employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term stability of staff in the industry known for the high turnover of employees.
"If the company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly filming his naked female neighbor, reports the news agency TT.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home after she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
The woman said the camera on the cell phone was filming in the apartment.
The woman who was frightened by the incident had run into another room to dress.
After the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but was recounted shortly thereafter.
A 20-year-old man suspected of collusion has admitted to filming a woman.
However, he claimed to have only filmed her face.
The video on the cell phone had been deleted, and the police had failed to return it to evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted to the act, but has denied committing the crime.
The man was justified in his portrayal by saying that he loves his neighbor as "a madman."
According to the news agency, a man is being prosecuted.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than that of the export industry, for example, but the gap should be reduced," said OAJ President Olli Luukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements that do not in some way involve holiday allowances cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts are likely to arise only after private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of increase are clear.
Luke predicts that, for example, the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets Luke did not yet reveal.
Lukeka is also the president of the public-trained advisory organisation Juko.
Lukekainen: Holiday allowance surgery increases earnings-related development differences
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is declining, while private sector purchasing power is increasing at the same time.
According to the reader, a fixed-term holiday allowance cut further exacerbates the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be determined how many pupils per teacher can be:
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who are best and those who are weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are declining, and differences between pupils and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day was extended as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, a group of UCLA American football players have been left to talk to the other side of the campus's new training fields.
Some have taken off their jerseys, and their backs shine out of the sweat after the first day of the training camp.
For a lot of them, this few minutes of conversation is a noon break.
After three hours of training, college students return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning, they meet at 6:30 a.m. at the Wasserman football center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's change for Tuesday.
The University Sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was intended to reduce the workload of players, but has extended their days – at least until Friday, when final exams are held.
That's why UCLA's first three rehearsals started 15 minutes past seven in the evening. It was hard for players already to find space on full schedules.
The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coach season, which has continued for six seasons in Mora, when the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, although it made the players' schedules even tighter.
"We load them very much for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great friends.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the rehearsals from outside after the camp. It is not easy considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel on the coming weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when the rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film rehearsals from there on video. It is not an exaggerated concern.
It's a lot of money to pay for a video that's been filmed for rehearsals.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother myself with it too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially seeks his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
Then the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to run because the constitution that bordered the presidency into two seasons was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely held leader.
In his time, there have been social reforms in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagamek has promised his people more freedom after the land has been raised on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by enhancing fact check
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more to independent fact reviewers and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact reviewers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the largest distributors of fake news. Many feel that fake news influenced the results of the United States presidential election in 2016.
The subject has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, will support the plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact check is being tried in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories do not pass through the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share," wrote Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook's news feed on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing Related articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Origin of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
Little Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known from Squeeze's music video as well as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history. Now, at a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a fan of old documents by a mop-haired writer.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says a longing.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he appeared Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose inspirations were documents of the National Library of Britain. The project was emotional.
"I went to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent working for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at the time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he himself is there.
I love archives!"
An author who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay a little longer than would have been desirable.
He spent days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hung hyena heads on walls and bottles of centuries on a moat.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and discussed the book with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes illustrating artists.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the staff of the Foundation were only just starting a study of the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained journals, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, families fought even for one birch.
I thought, "Let's give it a rest."
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It is about a man who joins shortly after the castle was completed in 1381 as a peasant of England.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
Perhaps these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of a priest that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral filled with coffin stones (it was discovered years later when his tomb was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been quite a bunch of punks. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Lifeinmäki, a sanitarium in the early 20th century, where only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," she says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
The worst relations with Russia since the Cold War
Military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, commented Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of NATO on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
In my opinion, NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg stated in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the East Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to acting in such a way that tensions do not strain itself.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump was able to find that the gap between the USA and Russia was even dangerously poor.
Trump urged to thank the country's poor relations with Congress, which adopted new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitzko quits - a rematch against Anthony Joshua will not happen
The long-standing heavyweight champion of professional boxing Vladimir Klitzko ends his career.
Klitzko of Ukraine, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitzko, who struck gold at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, fought as a professional 69 times, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitchko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him with points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitzko faced Wembley at the stadium Anthony Joshua and lost after a wild match with a knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitzko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitchko, however, found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match, Klitchko reported in his press release.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitzko's reasons for his decision on video.
Klitchko's manager Bernd Bönte told in the bulletin that the closure decision was difficult for Klitchko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, Mr Bönte said.
Klitchko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettie since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter born in 2014 Kaya.
Klitzko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of different unions at the same time.
The Finnish weatherbreaker is enchanting the conditions: "Takes from the mood"
Impaled skimmer Minna Nikkanen has suffered conditions during the summer's outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkase has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken the woman off her spirits.
Even the London World Cup has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
Circumstances have been this summer against polesher Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't get even the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've competed and practiced here for God knows how many times and I've never experienced such fluctuating wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi at Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, with such unstable winds at rehearsals too," Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather spoke on Thursday in London.
It's been a bit challenging getting the technology together. Is it cold stuff or what?
It's been cold, it's windy, and it's taken the mood.
There's no point in consuming energy in a bad situation.
He got into the 455th World Cup thanks to his hangar jump.
It's gone 445 outside.
The circumstances in London are not the same for everyone.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross Friday qualifier 460.
Why don't you go back to training abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was from the early season in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technology's standardized.
I guess I should have done the same thing now.
Normally you've been able to practice in the hall, now the hall's been closed.
What would be an ideal race?
Twenty-five degrees.
A little wind is fine, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official brutalized politicians at Yle: "We have no division now nor for many years"
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in the hat and beware of expansing the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who prepared the budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
According to him, there is no division.
Yle interviewed the retired Virta in 2015 in Wednesday's 1st Morning.
The construction of the state budget for next year is about to begin.
Recently, politicians' proposals, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bicycles, are raised by Virtanen as election talks.
They mainly tell us that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a betrayal to talk about a split thief when you take debt," Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as Budget Secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of Budget Department and Budget Manager.
Last before retiring, he served as Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the now predicted 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a spike from which to go downhill next year, and Finland expects a 1% increase for decades.
Washington changes the rules of a permanent residence permit
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the Green Card rules will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants who know English and can support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy will benefit from the new application process," Trump stated according to the media.
The wife of the Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture Prince Henry and Queen Margaret filmed in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her spouse Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the pair of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in the Roskilde Cathedral, the court states in its press release on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the Prince's discontent with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the court communications manager Lene Belleby commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his mate.
According to the Court, the Queen has long been aware of the wish of her spouse's burial site and understands the decision.
The Moment of Horror on the Road: The car nearly came on the highway
Tomm had a common-law spouse and two young children on board.
They weren't injured in the accident, but they won't get the insurance money if the other party isn't reached.
The crash occurred at Keimlanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa reports that her family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law spouse Riina and the two young children of the couple drove on the freeway at Keimlanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From Ring III's exit to the Hämeenlinna Passage, a white car drove along the accelerator lane, which nearly drove the family car to the side, says Tommi.
If it wasn't for the evasive motion, the car would have come on top of Tomm.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family car hit the railing at a high speed.
Parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under the age of three, the other is under the age of one.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one passed us, even though there was heavy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tomm, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The staff of the ambulance and emergency services came in, and the family condition was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi tells us that he and his common-law partner have a low income, and they received a family grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, Tomm says the family won't get the insurance money.
That's why the family wants eyewitnesses to find out about the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to kindergarten and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, elderly car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car's license plate was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're doing financially, we're gonna have to count every cent now.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know anything about it will be in contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the East Uusimaa Police Department and Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they have had a mission on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 21.15: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the second car, according to Tomm, did not enter the incoming lane, but was driven from the accelerator lane to the side of the family car.
The performance directed by Lotta Jäppinen deals with relationships through humor - A self-detector is seen at What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first guidance to the What? theatre.
The self-detector is a musical theatre performance of past relationships and inadequacy.
According to Lotta Jäppinen, director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is addressed through humor.
You don't stay in a bad mood, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been implemented with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about himself when you get to know a new person.
Do you think he's playing some kind of role or is he approaching the other one with his jacket open?
A plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws from the ideas of young people, it addresses all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Self-detector does not directly tell about his own relationships or the group's relationships.
Fact and fiction mix.
I'm sure my own values will be passed on by the show.
I do not think that relationships are bad, but I also do not think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-detector is drawing a current picture of young adults living in Finland who are 100 years old.
According to him, many have learned much about relationships with their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
Musical adaptation is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies as director of theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Art.
There's two years back and another one in front.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The music class breeder has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, at the Linna Theatre in Turku.
Directing has become more and more interesting.
The self-detector premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
The performance lasting about 45 minutes has also seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen's study town of Turku.

The Finnish Olympic winner recovered for a year from a gruesome motocross accident - the neck spine fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of the kumparelis toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement of Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter for new species.
There may not be many forms of exercise on earth that the Kemijärvin would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I licked wounds at home for a year, says Lahtela.
The bribe had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the crash.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't use it to get boundaries.
It's just so tough as a sport that you don't want to overdo something like this in your 40s!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind was a long start as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in employment immediately after her own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching period, Lahtela often challenged his protégé in the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that even my own thoughts did not seem reasonable.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it, because for the first time in my life, all I could do was be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
If he didn't stop, he'd be afraid he'd burn out.
It's easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of speed sports.
I traded motocrosses for Frisbee golf!
He's gone right out of his hand.
At worst, I was seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela herself has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer, she does not require that she be trained to be like him.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture, there is room to be your own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been that way," says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be worried.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry – just when it had begun to feel like 2017 can't get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5–10 years.
"We must begin to take seriously the generalisation of sex robots," says Foundation's founding member and robotics and AI emeritus professor Noel Sharkey of Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are moaned, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a warm silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to its own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and colour of fingernails.
Even more worryingly, robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford's women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, to shyness.
The Roxxy Gold robots of True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
"Roxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, chatty or "in that mood."
There are many worrying features of the generalization of sex robots that replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistant, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot on its website to a vibrator:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalisation and development reflects something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subordination is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their increasing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And a lot of people don't start acting weird or offensive until the market says they can.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have become more widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the White House is sitting in a president who has boasted of harassing women.
The television series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Orjatar) is not the most worrying imagery of it, such as pictures of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the show's world feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Efforts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (with the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot can't leave a relationship or a situation.
They have no will or history of their own — nothing that points to independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, the group was led by the Chief of ISIS
The chief of the extremist organization ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of having planned to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, a person in the leading figures of ISIS had also sent building parts of the bomb to Sydney.
The suspicions were that the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police won't give you any details as to why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic, colourless gas-discharge device and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian federal assistant commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were apprehended in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations continue as well.
The good things of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the root of common sense
During Trump's season, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that a strong split between voters has also broken up families on the daily level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory columns of American newspapers guided how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been given to Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet in Chicago who's long been at odds with the Republicans of our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying influence.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all know each other — including a Republican-friendly sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
It is a good thing at the dinner table, but, in broader terms, there are significant risks.
Trump has given new power to the left, but the distortive influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrorize his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump normalizes the Republicans of the right extreme, which, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I remember Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on a car roof, a 14% income tax (and at least his tax returns have been seen). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs only to be lucid, and it immediately seems to be a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Central Park Carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best you can get in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
Carousel’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and the animals that look back in horror — are ominous, and the screaming music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York’s emblem districts become disillusioned: the views of high buildings are becoming dull, the silhouette of the city becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not correspond to dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not completely overcome the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in northern London. Yes Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it does not count.
The central park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to such an extent that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two 40-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, this week I was asked at a department store to assess my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reading machine.
It's the same at the coffee shop in my neighborhood, but they also give me the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to the counter for coffee myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer servant to put his person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The store’s saleswoman smiled with regret when I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no trust in management"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq of the role of coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibility is assumed by Fabrizio Piccare, a former assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current duties.
Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in English Sunderland, among others.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of FC Inter's Board, regrets the incident.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, with no other option now, Håkans commented in the club's bulletin.
The Piccareta contract is valid until the end of the season.
He, along with the rest of the coaching team, is already responsible for tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to evening Sanomat's reports, the team has been in turmoil all Thursday night.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccare and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly clashed in an Inter match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius released a picture of youth from the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
On Instagram, violin artist Linda Lampenius released a youth image.
Several haustages have been added to the picture to determine that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders at the young woman who looks at the camera as a serious one.
A long time ago, serious, he's communicating.
If you don't see it, you can check it out here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful subjects.
About a year ago, on Instagram, he released a pair of pictures of himself.
In one picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the other he is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look, Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
She was already in hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which eventually was not revealed until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from prison to a hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospitalization for cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he suffered after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have stated their intention to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too mild.
The District Attorney intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported by the country's State Department according to a bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to television channel bTV, the State Department later announced that it released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on everyone camping in areas other than those reserved for the purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right may impose a fine.
Fluid stock sinks - already sunk -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's share has sunk by 7.7 per cent at around 11.
Its profit before taxes decreased but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange has started today on a slightly cold side, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock markets, the large European index of Stoxx 600 had fallen by 0.2%.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after about half an hour of trading and the most swapped companies OMXH25 had sunk by 0.3 per cent.
The total exchange of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which nine million were the morning result publicist Neste.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may facilitate irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease affecting about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness.
Those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome are generally urged to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen the resistance to the bowel.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that no harmful microbes hidden in food enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance, which protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Tests found that immune cells that enhance tolerance are present in mice with specific bacteria in their intestines.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the ingredients used to build proteins.
"We observed the connection between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote resilience. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal microbes in the intestine," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan in the mouse diet, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same is true in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In examining immune cells that enhance resilience, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same species of mice that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to intestinal microbes in mice, i.e. the normal gastrointestinal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
Six species of bacteria that were found in mice with immune cells but not in other mice were observed when the intestinal DNA of mice was examined.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that grew in a sterile environment without intestinal microbes and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
Scientists wanted to find out how the bacteria affected the immune system, growing Lactobacillus reuterial bacteria in the liquid and transferring small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into cells that enhance resilience.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophane metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse food, the number of cells increasing the resistance increased by about 50%. When the tryptophan count was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same resistant cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products of Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects related to tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inside of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan level combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalisation".
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "nero" in his ranks after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "neron" in his ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted with Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United's last season in the previous match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He made an impression as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, as he was not involved in the Asian tour of blue shirts before the season began. He only made it 45 minutes in the field – it has to be changed before the season of the major league, according to Mourinho.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romumu Lukaku were also starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting lineup for the start of the season.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done "a great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has prioritised.
"Three out of four – we must thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualification tournament to Germany directly 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German routine of gambling is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported in the bulletin.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third round Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany's leading the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who collected 14 points.

Reuters: The grand jury already issued challenges for Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has issued challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections.
The matter is reported by the news agency Reuters, who at the same time confirms the information revealed earlier on Thursday by the Wall Street Journal on the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin connections, which took place in the middle of the United States presidential election in June 2016.
Paul Manafort, then campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr, and his son-in-law, current White House advisor Jared Kushner were also present.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has called a grand jury in Washington marks a condensation of the pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help with an investigation to investigate Russia's involvement in the United States presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his immediate circle collaborated with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify affidavitally.
A large number of jurors are a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence found in the prosecution's investigation and decides whether the case should be prosecuted.
A British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a hand swing
The British inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides service to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, so that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses a similar technique to that used in microchips in cats and dogs, and only takes 30 seconds to install it.
Northam's attempt also to turn the locks of houses and cars into compatible microchip. One lock costs £300 to process.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
A white house exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the South lawn of the White House for an event presenting American production costing taxpayers $24,000. The information is found in military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is on board it. It was a attraction at an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017 that featured American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter produced in Connecticut, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military agency had requested a helicopter to appear on mission-specific orders only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern grass field for an "exceptional" event. This is evident from the naval HMX-1 helicopter squadron's documents.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, who is the Deputy Commandant of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field at around 17.7. in the morning and the event would begin at 3 in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave the scene until the lawn field was emptied between 6 and 9 in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if the helicopter was delayed leaving the White House, another crew would be required to be present due to restrictions on service periods.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The US Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to be broken," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can attend," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At the event, the President spoke out in favour of the reform of health care and looser state regulation that was before the Senate at the time.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents have to use them on their travels.
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the President's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticised the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America event, which featured products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," stated White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train in the southern grass field to bring the President to the White House with an accuracy of centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly crew training quota.
The unit's helicopters were also flown 11 hours that day in "non-Presidential support missions".
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesperson reported that the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have records of flights related to Presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly fees, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit records, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to and back to the White House lasted a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating a helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by the RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defence equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly proper to bring it up."
It is not certain whether Trump was in a helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down for the driver of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit the Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to technical failure, announced by the Railway Traffic Centre.

The railway station did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repairs by the morning.
Venezuelan State Prosecutor calls for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative body of the country
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new representative body in the country.
Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the representative council elected last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, an obstruction decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also begun an electoral fraud investigation on the vote.
He appointed two judges to the post after the British company organised the representative vote reported that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the assembly, and Maduro's son and wife are among others in the elected 545-member assembly.
In addition to changing the constitution, the representative body can break up the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the shaping of the Constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, on the other hand, have announced that they do not recognise the new representative body.
Maduro claims that the new representative body is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, the unrest has been continuing for months.
They have wounded numerous people and over 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new representative body is to begin.
A Russian man handed over by Finland was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced the 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. claim.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
In February 2016, Finland handed Senah over to the US judicial authorities despite Russian protests, reports AFP.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud that had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is deported from the country after a prison sentence was served.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticised Finland after the arrest and said that a man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were criticised for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecution, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used to fish for user names and passwords.
The scammers then used the information by continuing to control internet traffic, which was used to make clique scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Department of Justice Crimes, the incident shows that the United States is also capable of targeting other active cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco stated in the press release.
Modified at 8:58: Corrected littering of the name of the condemned person.

Kari Kola implements an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in Kuavssa) implements an exceptional work of light art in honor of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument off it.
In my work, I want to highlight not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things I feel important concretely visible," says Kari Kola, a light artist from his work.
I am well taken by the invitation to be involved in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when, in honor of the anniversary, he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters.
I feel very privileged to remake my art at UNESCO headquarters, says Kari Kola.
The work may still expand very significantly.
We will inform you about this later in the autumn to come," Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to mankind and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.

From Timo Soin, with a question mark, the article headlined: "After that came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) released a blog post on Thursday, headlined with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
During my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The Soin text contains references to 18th-century France.
The Madame de Pompadour of King Louis XV or his mistress is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, there are phrases in the books of history "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood."
According to the UN, democracy in Afghanistan depends on the political role of women
The elections are only representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN delegation to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the UN Aid Mission, stated that hundreds of women are nominated in the provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
The elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential election will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has raised threats to elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power is passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution strengthens Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists threatens the culture of the area
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The local rage is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours and is rushed through the sights of large troops.
Venice is suffocated by urgent day trips to the city by tourists.
On the narrow streets it is difficult to move and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historical center, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon a low quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, two or three hours are given.
You follow the ticket-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
Saint Mark's market is also one of the most popular sites for visits to Venice's historic centre.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment, and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave each year.
If this continues, after a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organizing the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income that it urgently needs and create the need for a wide range of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is envisaged that cruisers would go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, felt that the situation would certainly change if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited every year by about 20-30 million tourists.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Traffic on the motorway is bad for miles
On the freeway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the northbound lane has had mileage from Thursday afternoon's work during return traffic.
The area is covered by highway coating, which slows traffic," says Savon Sanomat.
For road works there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h speed.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon, practically walking speed.
Roadwork proceeded on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinjärvi side at the Statue of Revelation, or golden goat.
I'm getting along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released wonderful pictures of herself in the landscapes of the Grand Canyon, among others.
The Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in his current home country of Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-meter run in March by orbiting at the time of the track round 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 m fence running at the time of the Norwegian record 55.38.
Iuel, a busy social media user, soon after his record, found that fame and publicity have their drawbacks.
Men around the world began sending images of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "dumb photos" from strangers, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of photos he received.
You can guess, Luel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I get along fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of Dad's work, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand, and the United States were on duty.
Iuel spent four years as a college athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask no questions, only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete," Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the fence run.
The leg injury put the whole career of the snowboarder Janne Korve on the line - now in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It's been nice counting now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, among Finland's most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved species again this season.
Last summer, a career extension was still at stake.
The leg weight injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to heal at all.
Even the hand had been hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether the boarding was going to continue or not.
Sponsor dealers were in rehab and many things were open," Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull back into the slope.
After that, the decision to continue was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to the snow.
I was like, "Damn it, it's so funny again, let's take a few more seasons."
The raven did not count properly until September and October, but after a long landing break, mere painless training has been a big deal.
The Kisoja Raven has only been around a few.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of surfing for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to aim four years at one race, and then you're in a fever for that week.
I'm tired of thinking like that, Raven says.
Today, Korpi competes in the Halfpipe of the Spanish Sierra Nevada World Cup.
Although individual races do not keep him on board, he always breaks out in heavy company for racing.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the last few years, although some of the boarders chose the X-Games in Norway to be held at the same time.
Yeah, it's a big race. It's a big show.
Although I think that appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkinenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was there when everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It's a new power for you, too. Raven's thinking.
There's still some way I can keep up in the slope, but otherwise I can't, that's how much power my friends have!
Janne Korpi has also built a different sports career in the background of the ferrying career.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on my way all the time, that's all I have to do.
But every day I look at at least the race results and usually at some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, race management and race coaching are a potential career plan when the surfing career comes to an end in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel it like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the edge of time and develop, and maybe in the summer I'll drive some departures.
If it's my future profession, then it won't be hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The restaurant stuff also includes the Elitloppet restaurant cruise with the host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that heads to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet race.
Raven and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well for sale, and people have been thrilled.
We are already at the point where there will at least be no bankruptcy.
A few months is still time, let's hope we can fill the ship," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project to Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esther is the name of a new care home for 41-seat elderly people to be built at Kite.
The 1,700 floor square metres building should be completed next summer across the health centre's neighbour's Health Road.
At Kite, the common theme of wonder is where customers are enough for the new care unit, as now many private nursing homes are suffering from a shortage of customers during Siu's wars.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director for Care Services, commented that Kitee will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, says Flink.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kitee, Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The sale concerned business, but the property is reported to have a five-year lease.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand's Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's cookie manufacturer's leaders of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish Department of the General Trade Union of the UK GMB, the company has not reported its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products are manufactured by more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie's brand, reported that it invested over £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives are "probably the first to be told" if there are any changes to their activities.
In his letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company "to respond to the concern that no funding has been allocated to modernising the production lines".
The GMB trade union Drew Duffy finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the labour force is heavily concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow. The factory is a major employer in high unemployment and low income areas.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihood, and Brexit, rising cost of living and continued reduction of production, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis spokesperson, the factory manager had received a trade union letter only the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates continued interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and insecure companies, we continuously assess all our businesses and establishments in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, especially its production lines and improved operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a plant and we will certainly be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after paying £189 million to close the deal, but did PSG Barcelona warn you of a record transfer three years ago?
A sensational move is the most talked-out event of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football series team is ready to break the world record for the settlements. The previous record was less than half as small: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £89 million transfer amount.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £500,000 a week's salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way Neymar has been forced to leave the club. A source near Barcelona tells us that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced its interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned PSG's best players seeking clubs.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponent and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're after our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

Now, the calls Trump made were made up by a White House spokesperson, "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never occurred, reports the New York Times.
The calls made by Trump with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the Scouting Organization have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had occurred.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
According to Sanders, many of the scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto Trump had discussed Hamburg at the G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, that's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations took place, not only happened on the phone but face to face, Sanders justified.
Speech to the Scouts sparked disapproval
On Monday, Trump reported that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump's success in eliminating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto reported that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico again because they know that the trip will in any case stop at the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government released a press release saying that there has been no such call.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it Trump flaunted his speech at a major meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts Leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Scout Organization announced that it is not aware of any of its executives' call to Trump.
According to the press release, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, the leader of the organization, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks his side.
Trump's speech at the Scouting Organization's meeting sparked much wonder, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
