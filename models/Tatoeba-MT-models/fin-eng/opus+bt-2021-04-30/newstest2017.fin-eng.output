A 28-year-old chef was found dead at a mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping center's stairwell this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His affairs were finally going well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscole Frank Galicia, said San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined to be a homicide and that the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as a line chef at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said they were "haunted and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missed very much," the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the top of the hostels, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling cohesive with the family was to make us food, make us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted along with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial battle measures in their dispute over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) asks the whole Council to support new industrial battle measures since early September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical interns and medical students voted in July to reject a contract that had been agreed with BMA.
58 per cent of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night via Twitter, JDC president Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "sustainably quiet" about the issues that he said led to the rejection of the contract.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely proposed new treaty and demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for a progressive and expanding industrial battle programme beginning early in September.
The controversy has resulted in medical interns having participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA's medical interns, Dr Johann Malawi, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement negotiated by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical interns and students that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be assigned to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an association of outsiders?
Ele, which ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and to declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Peter's Palace, I had the clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands at the event.
But Putin's smile looked forceful, and he did not breathe much heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recap Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to the better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as having behaved as if nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was fierce.
Putin attacked blaming Duckara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an assumed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian general public has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade from the Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has expressly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received his request for an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
For severe, the benefits of settling a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all potential friends after being almost deposed in the failed coup of last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey.
In addition, there is an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by nearly 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights finally continue.
They hope for a late season rush into the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, government television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"Tourned there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper's report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding to it a long-standing grudge over the fast-track EU-member negotiations will bring up Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool and break Turkey's ties with the Western countries.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolution attempt to support designated authorities.
Of course, this is a clear story for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the gruesome seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to introduce a "exogenous coalition", as one analyst described to me: two countries that feel they have been abandoned by the West and mistreated by them, to join forces.
However, these two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It may be talkative that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster with NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better for two leaders to be on speaking terms again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s strategies have been using the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scottish customers, but it is not restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except head office and stock exchange listings are changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in a round of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand becomes the employer of our investor brand and employees because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's now time for us to move on to the brand bank, because basically (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after he has a total of 3000 wins after a double win
The racer Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in his second win of the evening on his home track while competing with the Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing riding.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey dettori, who previously won at Ghayar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not the Royal Ascot, it's the usual Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilection out after victory.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in obstacle competitions—master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the present era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical intellect separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador to competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big games!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but in addition to that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a commuter landing from the saddle.
From flying stops to jogging landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British racing ride for two decades.
It's been a roller coaster.
Plots of wins in big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft accident and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month ban on competition, but he showed significant strength of character in challenging skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has said earlier that he would like to continue competing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of leader of the Russian presidential regime", but he was not given a reason.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vainto, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he led the President's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the main task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting the laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be appointed as his replacement.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, operated the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a state television-show meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been received with real suspicion.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin's website to Putin, Ivanov said "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complex, even laborious, task for four years.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the State Security Service in the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Put's second term, as Put's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting a producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and a quarrel at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents' team are to be expected later.
The 54-year-old who starred in the Dharma & Greg situation comedy has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything I can for the past 12 years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
I had hoped to be part of it until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible working group and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series is planned for September 28.
Mysterious fish ended up in a garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, released film material from the apparition in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing crossing point: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry overpass and the ground bridge, meaning that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "cover lines" now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 gauze ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing point.
We all witness the truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the closing of the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck of the final section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, chief of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first lockout in any bridge project always has a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lockout represents the tip of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and combined with the expanding northern column road cover, we then had to close the remaining section from the north, i.e. inland.
This was done by pulling the land bridge of the northern bus 700 millimetres southward.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge, because the ground bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled about 3% in the slope angle.
Required, because the permitted measurement deviations, according to which the team worked, were tiny, only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alarm at 1.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw a boat traveling closer to men and imagined the worst," Moelfrey's lifeboat helm Vince Jones said.
" Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
The local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found weary hanging from the buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
There was a kill rope on the boat's engine, but it was somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their leisure time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had been somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which after discovery can be "photographs" (with a phone grid capture) or "catched".
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a considerable increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving from 45% to 53% of users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go, it only sees training levels.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have produced no result because most public health warnings are dull and are transmitted by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving spoilers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were previously apps like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give any reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new charm disappears and the use wears off in time.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games linking apps and virtual reality to real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in a multiplicity of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Energic in jumps.
It's good on the boom.
I can't believe the perm.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world out in the Olympic spotlight.
He had his overall score, 62.198, clearly better than silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
At the United States Simone Biles balance boom in the multiplicity of women's rack gymnastics finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman to have won the multi-match championship consecutively, and the fifth American champion overall. At the same time, she strengthened her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He gave way to tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings her to the same class as other best athletes of her generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
The final test was awaited in Brazil, a rivalry that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finale of women's rack gymnastics in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination at the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went on his long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program—which includes his trademark volt-hitting—has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a force.
He has not lost in a multi-match since summer 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in the small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, in which Biles is the reigning world champion, were waiting.
He ascended to the top at boompoints 15.433 and crossed them by receiving 15.933 perm.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose into the eyes of Biles with glitter, white and blue bounded eyes when the dream he once wrote about in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in the split third place, but lost to the bronze Mustafina in the remake.
This time a 22-year-old team leader, called "grandmother" by Americans, was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses of air to the public after his permanence in a state of emotion about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as the party is concerned, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting from this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot while they listened to music in the car
The two women who died in the most deadly attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade and a 12-year-old girl sat in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police bulletin released on Thursday.
Authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June in a car parked in the driveway.
The bulletin reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled with another vehicle.
According to police, the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or the $2,900 that the other adult victim had.
A representative of the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have died and two have been wounded in the nine attacks that took place over four months, committed in two predominantly Latin American districts.
"These happen in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to reveal evidence leading to the conclusion that the attacks are connected and are made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also released a police bulletin on the shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the triple murder, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have also been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, bullet in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike a large proportion of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not at all true - of course I agreed," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking on a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
In addition, he loves to play with his two brothers as well as sing.
Elizabeth will show you how Edmund invented signs to sign "sing for me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is not an ordinary sign language, he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephalism may be due to a number of different causes: genetics such as Edmund’s case, or pregnant viral infections such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of uncertain futures.
I'm just asking what's gonna happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't know.
Actually, I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's going to be easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
The heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana as well as southern Mississippi flooded their banks and posed a major flood threat due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they would receive requests for high water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahua County alone requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The floodkeeper is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the floodkeeper was in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood peak record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of Ascension County on the lower river as flooded rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas Lake.
South of the Mississippi State border, the Tickfaw River, flowing in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest ever level at Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescuers still pick up people from floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were near Gloster on Friday among those rescued.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It stretched all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have all the injuries, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-like truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods "strange quickly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of Tangipa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials reported.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa a member of the city council said 200 homes were hit by a flood.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said that authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by tides.
For those who have been evacuated, shelters have been opened in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, about 20 streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, city administrator.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that flat rain continued along the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no cases of flooding have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, the leader of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was full of bullets, survives the Philadelphia shooting.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown sustained several gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting his first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was crossfire between several shooters.
The attack weapon-type shells, which originate from various types of offensive weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It therefore appears that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active battle," Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and the police are investigating the surveillance tapes.
Another six-year-old, girl, was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, will all be proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established the presence of dark-skinned and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic winner, and America roared.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to have consistently won individual gold in a women's multiplicity.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the sport, but this is not what the situation looks like in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went along the same path as Aly and Madison as they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts on the team, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice mostly in private gym clubs operated by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (to coaches and their gymnasts, and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnasium clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighboring areas that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly blacks and Latins) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the controversy by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58 percent of the 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to force the contract, saying that NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even minor additional delays harm staff and patients.
The first medical trainees are transferred to a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA medical intern committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it accelerates the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met by the government's unwillingness to participate and occasionally deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not, the doctors will be prepared to continue the industrial struggle.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as replacements for doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the controversy by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants better weekend pay with 54,000 medical trainees under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employees employers' organization appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Labour battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, as well as causing concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differentials in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A two pound daily medicine can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
Anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of relapses in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS overseer NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people each year have a heart attack in England, and a quarter of these have a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material accumulated in the artery wall, which forms stenosiss.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation of blood into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can pass with the blood and cut the circulation to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said, "Without concern about the availability of effective anti-progressive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially as regards the risk of bleeding - are limited over three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim territories
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles bludgeoned police, election overseers and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
The former secretary of the community, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set up guard chains to protect voters who are frightened outside polling stations.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes putting in the finger of the voter in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected," says Sir Eric.
He calls for greater access for the press to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of a vote scandal in East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal actions.
The court found Rahman "kyunically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
As many as 300 votes were questionable or the result that a person votes, appearing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed his particular concern at voting for electoral fraud by mail, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations for the clearance of the voting system, including proof of identity with an identity card
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain communities of ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"Presented concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity".
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists to deal with ballots received by post in order to stop 'collecting votes'.
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for stricter checks on registered persons in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person who votes indestructible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made votes and envelopes through mail, where the votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adhere to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric incarcerated the police force in Greater London, saying that it is "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court stayed as a result of numerous corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his clerk," he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty without suspicion, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticizes the inefficient "cross-screen checks" in city council voting registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as a birther of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's cyclist double and other celebrity shows at the Rio Olympics
This week fans at the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone confused over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of his own famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures surfaced, where he looks scary like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, when he became aware of the fervor of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see a great resemblance, except maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London for 2012 will certainly emerge also this year: the startling resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The great, expressive eyes of Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina have been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sportal version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actor Annalynne McCord as tanned skin and blond hair, while US team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, shares a similar face form and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple similarity
A Twitter user recently expressed its happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful broad smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator makes an apology after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women's 4x200-meter freestyle message enraged CBC live Olympic broadcast viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "disappeared like a bad smell" and "dead as a pig".
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring "color", was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the time of the second leg of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Taylor Ruck of Canada, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the women's freestyle 4 x 200 m relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was sand and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how indifferent Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang. #absolute."
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who hosted a CBC broadcast, apologized on live air for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was put on the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Reporter Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and linked an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and were broadcast live.
Last night we took rapid action and apologized on live television to our viewers and followers in social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized on live air and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in the moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of a swimmer, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client dismayed by a woman who arrogantly adapted undergarments in the middle of a store
The customers didn't know where to watch a woman strip in the middle of Primark's shop to try underpants.
Things didn't improve because after assessing what he looked like in his pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to go around and eventually adapted four pair of underpants in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman adapted panties and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after experimenting with underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of featured panties, took off her own pantyhose and underwear, and put on her adaptable feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for atonement, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone was staring when he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding he didn't like anything he saw, dressed up again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, 33 years old in the town of Kent, said, "It is disgusting to think that someone will take home the panties that someone else has tried but who have not been cleaned."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I thought the staff apparently tried to remove the pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and discover that another woman has put them on and stripped them off, and they have not been washed."
Primark's spokesman said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in Folkestone's movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All these products have been withdrawn from sale."
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York City to find out how to handle gun-wrecking robbers in close range.
Then approached you from the front or the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "raise the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to tipper, twist the gun from his hands, hit him in the back of the gun in the face and back off with the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video for exactly how Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
A host and travel writer from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each target licked, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called Internal Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem totally repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in the mouth of evil taste.
Wright became known as a test of the endurance of his intestines as he travels around the world and eats strange and wonderful things.
This task from the public rail station rails to the toilet seat flush button really tested his immune system.
In the film that was made, he said, "Since childhood I have been quite careless about my health, and I have put in my mouth all kinds of things since dirt, worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
By comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be below 60.
But in a Russian public latrine he refused to lick when the photometer's result showed more than 4,000 units, with the result of newly washed hands being less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, on the trail of Internal Power, along with the Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
On the trail of internal power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the leader of the selection snacks, juice and new categories, said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and which would at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'calling Ian'."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary is an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Document director Tom Hakala added, "Let's say it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked of him, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks stored."
In a 2015 poll by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that at least occasionally they use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The bully family destroyed a rented house in Saltashi, Cornwall, before eviction
The bully family caused £50,000 in damage to their rented house after being evicted for terrorizing neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints about them.
After being forcefully removed from the property, shocked housing company staff found the property to be in poor condition.
Blaming openings had been made in the walls, floorboards had been torn, waste had been spread on the floor, and walls had been graffitid.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of issues to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious."
The couple had three sons who lived between the property, and police say that the family's tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and excessive shouting, fighting, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on anti-social behaviour.
Many rooms in the house under the threat of demolition found old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs were previously transmitted, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called in.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here so many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the ferocious wall of the rented house.
He added, "It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's conduct, as eviction is always the last course considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions certainly appalled the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and the courageous community members who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
After eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Housing company employees must now clean up the waste stacks around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis as well as scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting his guilt to possession of a class B drug as an intention to distribute it further.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone. He died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless after now being in private accommodation in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many walls of the house's rooms.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior, and police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.

The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept by really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
It was at this moment that horrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost to touch from sun worshipers on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandly worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not at first see what was behind the clouds coming toward them.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who released videos of a dramatic passing in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was crashing to the ground."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight intended to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual due to the poor visibility of smoke from nearby terrain fires, but the Air Force assured that no one was in danger of safety.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low visibility due to conditions that hindered visibility, smoke caused by off-road fires, and thick fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
The results of the first half of the executable are better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made €3.4 million better than planned.
The result of the exes was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where institutional care has been dismantled by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was fulfilled in all activities.
This year, the exote aims to shorten the ranges of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border jägers took a military oath at Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
An inauguration of the 10th Special Cross-Border Course took place at the garrison's sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 conscripts.
Special border Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special borderer.
250 of them were invited to the selection tests.
Special border jägers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime border forces were involved in a veteran's meeting in connection with the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A lot of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating the RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The function of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit includes a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The chief of staff is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civil person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports to the rest of the police.
In turbulent, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the party until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, its less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit was established in each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Crime Police, runs operations nationally.
PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to police services and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your area
As the individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing, and is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, the author forms a certain image.
Serialisation can be done on the basis of either the method of making or the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
The methods used by both criminals and their own are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent criminal-fighting attempts by the police.
The police will publicly report the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news of early summer, the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housebreaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
Pre-trial investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they have made.
The clever ones order the District Court minutes, for example, which may indicate that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station, and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from Central Crime Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl who joined fathers from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and will for others that there are real risks of going into a war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told that the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton sees Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if he is elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a phone conference that he predicts with "some degree of certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "smuggle the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia Cathedral.
Reid said that Republicans blocking Garland's appointment are Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's "handlers" and "possibly".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says that the nude calendar is for "women as well as men"
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The chairman of the treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's for them too.
"We have to start showing timeless and classic nudity again, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personal open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with irritable insults written by the nickname NoAll Lonely Medium-aged Men, note that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken new arrival of records is not because more and more born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for middle life.
Apparently, those who have recently bought vinyl discs are most likely between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of all records are purchased by members of the 18-24 age group.
It is also not just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but of emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are you Gov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I would sign up livelyly before I stop, I would form a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, such as, "Let's look into it."
Let's take a closer look.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants, shops and office supplies are now filling buildings with previously independent movements - a handful of magnificent specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment as I stand very close to various men in some of these stores in an attempt to assess their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London due to a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4000 records.
These records, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records released when there were 11, or 12, records I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts that enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit into YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and have become in need of buying their old records back.
From the discussions I have had, people have been getting rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their discs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakened at a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional meaning of the records?
It takes a few seconds for a store like Phonica to realize that record stores provide a comfort community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payments system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar disc covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage lucky days.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort, which is created by the possession of objects," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the record stack.
A April opinion poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would likely appear to be gravely concerned as I browsed through the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men) has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a great deal, but this is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The top, which now has almost a full layer reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements - from speakers to boxes Wild Beast's most recent synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - is great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is difficult to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, looking at various records for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so record collecting is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm studying jeans, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
But considering that even the slightest attention given to these items can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho's pitfalls for more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the proportion of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items, such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning snooping around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television host as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the Holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five metres long.
French court rejects application to terminate shops in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to defuse a total of 72 temporary trades where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's Office justified that the sites should be demolished because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by the government-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for eviction of people running 72 temporary trades, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people living in "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe of the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals daily, English and French lessons and asylum advisers for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 people - top reading - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland is falling sharply to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9%.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second most in those EU countries with a similar level of wages.
In the United Kingdom, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are based on an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data are from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices hit close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The Russian import bans on food are now weighing the price, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S Group and Kesko have both decreased their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been shown in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen heavily.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive of EU countries with a similar wage level to that of Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same level of wages.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to reach the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and continue to compete in prices," says Lehtinen.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School's not exactly the same anymore.
Returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan indicates official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, learning about fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding begins in schools.
Swedish education will begin in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education will begin to be studied in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
In this way, an effort is being made to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - an ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) known as ice sharks does not reach maturity until the age of 150.
It can live after that for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim all over northern Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, can grow up to over five metres tall.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year according to the results, adult individuals have forcibly lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined adult ice sharks from the ages of 28 females caught in fishermen's traps.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493- and 502-cent Amazon fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice-fin females reach maturity only over four metres, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - no less sellers
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a troubled company ended in early August.
"As a result of negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann says in his press release.
It states that the number of suppliers in the department stores will not be reduced in order to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, around 80 support workers are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned around 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the need for a reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
In the background are Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store pay.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the department store is still losing.
According to the acting CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company's objectives.
"Personal deductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018, says Veijalainen in the bulletin.
The result improvement of the second quarter was motivated in particular by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter turnover and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north... temperature below 20 degrees across the country.
The center of low pressure over the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, meteorologist of HS.
There are showers also in the central parts of the country, but there is a pout further south.
The temperature is no longer very summertime, as mercury in the whole country is below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees are left.
Kenya's athletic team is shaken by a doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach's stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah attempted to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leadership, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," the president of the Kenya Olympic Committee, Kip Teke, on the other hand, thundered at the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way to fourth place and is a front-runner of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only ran on an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials faced him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium following athletics.
On Friday, Rio began the struggle for athletic medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first - day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
There was another four years ago in London, where the stadium bulging from cheering crowds.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics' lack of spectators has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of vacant benches have appeared in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal hopes at Talita Antunes and Larissa, Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the 12 000-person stands were filled.
Bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
Although even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, told the weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million ends to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold by the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1,000 for the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in vacant seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less known species such as golf and rugby for schoolchildren in the country.
Rio Stadium had plenty of vacant seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Central Salo competed in London 2012.
There was a lot of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Private, companies and entities can then cash in on the holders' rights to land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by willing parties for payment of the right of holder.
The holder is entitled to veto its 187-square block, which in practice means that no holder is required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of control is something concrete that can be left as inheritance or gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself to something to protect nature," says Juha Leviakangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The person acquiring the right of control will receive precise location information from their section, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of holders who have acquired rights on the Foundation's website are displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Levikangas sees the risk of its acquisition of nature conservation only that the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turkey most of the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves most torment Turkey from the large cities of Finland.
Compared to the population, more bikes have been stolen there this year than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police on the basis of bike thefts reported, how many bicycles and parts of bicycles have been stolen in the ten largest cities in January and August of this year, calculated on a per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, a double number of thefts are carried out in proportion to the number of residents compared to others," describes police inspector Tommi Reen of the Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by the amount of bike traffic in the city and how many wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it very expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the lead in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling towns.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city where city centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary vehicle for mobility," says Reen.
In Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have come to the attention of the police in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and about 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a theft of a bike, although fewer than one in ten reported cases are found.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where police are informed of theft immediately and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Events can also be found in other investigations, when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug case in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses, and bike cellars, for example, in practice wherever they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopos are most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other kinds of locks.
Some thieves take the wheel for short - term use, for example, but much of the stolen wheels end up on the market, for example, via the Internet.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not become known to the police that stolen wheels would go much abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
I bet some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant, as he may commit a concealment offence or violation.
"An alarm clocks should ring if a wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underpriced price," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa for his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Moose says. "Never been taken, has been a good monk in that regard."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves so much, it may not even have a hipster value," Helvi, from Helsinki, ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was a quick customer in the Helsinki Kallio kiosk, locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike was hanging against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, as this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," says the Helsinki student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time hears from friends that wheels have been taken."
"Most of the bad bikes, such ruckus Jopos".
A bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the house company from the wake itself a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve was expecting it to be taken.
The responsibility of people under 15 for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jury teams familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
The peer jury is involved in the first crime committed by a youth.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss the incident with the offender and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender himself can join the peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used side by side.
"Everything guides the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined by the first mistake," says Laitio.
Peer jurorship has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflexes what happened with about the same age.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you continue along the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Helsinki Project of Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influences want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed instead of Trump's campaign to the congressional election.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring the Democrats a landslide in these elections," the letter says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the congressional election can Republicans be prevented from drowning a Trump-enriched anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is prominently opposed to Trump by Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the United States economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handout to American workers who suffer after factories migrate to countries of cheap labor.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builders, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the tax of departure," Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As President] I oppose any trade agreements that act against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced on Monday by Republican Donald Trump for "only favoring millionaires like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that she herself was the daughter of a small entrepreneur.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton pricked.
Such are Rio ratings: Games have not glued Finns to squares, but mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports games are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympic Games have not reached a staggering number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships of one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships were well over another million.
For the time being, the most interesting Olympic sports have been the Sunday night cycling and the fifth race day-opened rack gymnastics, both of which reached nearly half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Yle Sport, is pleased with the ratings, and reminds us that viewers will be divided at the Rio Olympics for the first time into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the overall selection of the Olympic Games by a large number of TV viewers.
Even on the television side, viewers divide into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports games for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are from 20,000 to 500,000 viewers throughout that time, it is a good basis.
The ratings are smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland during nighttime.
Another reason for the weak interest - if someone now thinks it is weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings at the start have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most download free app in Finland during the first days of the Games at Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get network ratings until later". Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not operated on all users as hoped.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained that should correct the errors.
Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio, Yle Speech transmits games every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the back of the cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technology dive instructor, found a 20-square-foot imprint on the Crossback, with a depth of 104 metres on the bottom.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to strengthen the observation by echoing.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres," says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for the time being, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne does not reach the ten deepest ones and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29: Corrected last song where the deepest lakes in mid depth were wrong.
Ideal for a tax bill: Pensioners' taxation is still strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more strained than that of employees.
An Ihalainen says that the malpractice came up under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment with employees.
This is not included in the government proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the election," he says to West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners were subject to deductions, which reduced taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in parliament, who grilled Alexander Stubb, then finance minister, about election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, in a line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the hard-earned competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning it.
It is needed because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
In the run-up to long-term unemployment
The idol appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth, in a budget debate.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in the Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to cancel their trip to Thailand due to the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following," Westphalen says.
In Thailand, very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season dates to the turn of the year.
The majority of Thailand travellers come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to pursue Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No record of the author
Westphalen says there's no record of who did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that events may be related to political unrest in the divided society of Thailand and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country were arrested who expressed opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population is brewing, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks should affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in Phuket, popular by tourists, and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the resort island Phuketilla exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded, according to the paper, in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
In the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
At least one person was killed in each double bomb attack.
In addition, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than in southern Thailand and in the town of Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to transport to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta that dominates Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any further, he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks by Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the perpetrators has been to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finnish residents to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to cancel their trip to Thailand because of the explosions, but it is worth following the guidelines on caution, says Westphalen.
In the wounded Europeans
So far very little is known about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
A little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin has been available.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a clock tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was, according to the provincial governor, hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about half an hour apart.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won a women's four-game
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second score of 60,098 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, still pursues rack championships at the Rio Games with a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the point of mind over the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row as well as the boom last and last year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two team race world championships.
Dimer World Cup medals Biles has jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, running a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this," Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then bird flu, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The office of Huovila's company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been placed for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the shops on Main Street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, a lot of people hadn't even heard of the attacks.
At half-three o'clock a day in Thailand time at Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the scene of the attack.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men fitting the description hidden in a nearby spruce.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank the people who tipped me off.
Research Director on Russia's leadership changes: A clear move away
On Friday, Russia underwent the highest-ranking leader change in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Persecution, 44 years old, with Estonian background.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as second-in-command of Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from garnering too much power.
He adds that recycling management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up independent power for themselves.
According to the Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in conflict with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop to Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, is taking on special duties in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the amendment to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other tasks and suggested Persecution in his place, said Russia Today.
The Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view this is a clear drop in station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is Putin changing his immediate circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, who is a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the important city of Manbiji for ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Corrected prior news at 19:30: Earlier we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document public policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Health from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Home Ministry previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening Sanam.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the data had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's Communications Director says to the STT that the need to reform practices has been identified in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has run against time under the high-ranking championships.
He injured his back thigh in the early season and had to skip the Jamaica Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dress samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Around Porina Bolt, it is underlined that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200-meter primary rounds at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and rival self-reliance despite the final festival at the time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career law point with a clock measured.
World records of 9.58 in 100 metres and 19.19 in two hundred born in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-meter world record and a 19-second low, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's hard challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the dignitaries if he has only been on the way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup finale was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and Rio's races are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of the career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals from Rio: two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A Chinese swimmer in Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, the Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100-meter butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping cases to the International Court of Appeals for Sport for CAS.
Xinhua reports that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide would have been found in a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent Rio to the home of an athletic coach because of a doping offence.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, reported that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media records, this is Kenyan express coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
Phelps is unstoppable - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps swam in a 200-meter mix his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic golds.
At the same time, Phelps reached the Olympic gold of the same species as the first swimmer in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japanese Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have some fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview with Evening Magazine.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton does not stress much if social media or the British press has small noises about his revealing and extraordinary costumes.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high heels and a short dress with at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to impress and perhaps startle, but he insists that he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that this has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a stir from scratch if it comes from dressing (the host).
I'm a little amused if someone like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police made two arrests for suspected terrorist activity.
On Thursday, Rio police announced that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the Games' security surveillance.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as police arrested as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have ties to the Isis interlocutor organization.
The detainees had reportedly instigated violence in social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed in, among others, the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their early part of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after having controlled the blasting of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the blasting of the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and didn't let the audience in until after.
The drink woke up the race for the sleepy-starting Spanish team.
With two defeats, Spain, which started the races, won Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two games, Spain reached silver.
The police already completed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of a road cycling target last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their initial section of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame made Petäjä-Siren - Finnish pondered the protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine dame poked Wind Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped," Joakim Wilenius, Finland's head coach, told.
Athletes considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because it would have been pointless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water so I could have been compensated," Petäjä-Siren stated.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish was left in number 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
The car accident on the tip didn't have much effect.
Friday is an important day when you have to race the departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that, according to science, lengthen the age
Science has studied everything between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are habits that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his or her life is extended.
On the other hand, things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to average body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
Sometimes you don't even have to spend your time picking up a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "the reduced risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is advocated by studies that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, a study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in the rest of the human body.
A survey conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected human life.
The seven-year project was monitored by over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were more gruesome persons 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when the protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also lengthen the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he must also have orgasm.
The exercise will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute solitude.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete at the Olympics or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live beyond the usual chubby.
A lot of research has been trying to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years into his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour among people aged over 65 found that the person shopping daily was likely to be a less frequent parent.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So put your credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpihuma derailed into a truck.
On Friday evening, a serious truck and passenger car collision occurred in Koskella, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in Koskella, Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car received had drifted in the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left up in the lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The emergency services removed the injured driver from the car and were transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The women's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of a felony DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range because the mail had delivered some of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernivo, was on Thursday buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when the Post gets the load delivered!
So, if there's no traffic in the lawn cut, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to cover lawn mowers.
The lawn cutting is available to the Post until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign to be mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the upgrade struck me with surprise.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention this issue attracts is incredible, Haltia wonders.
Friday night, Haltia's upgrade had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Elt was able to catch his own favorites in a loose candy bag, although a few tins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Evening Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five platforms strayed to the wrong place (Wall River) yesterday and we no longer went to do part delivery (Saloon) in three, but we only took five platforms today, the Kaidesos told the Evening Sanomat.
The evening Sanomat was the first to announce.
Teija Halt was not indignant with the sign because he found all his own loose candy favorites in the selection.
A dizzy diet! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost tens of pounds since his child was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a photo pair on Friday for her change in Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed at a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her dieting work as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures of his staggering performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Before and after Backlund, a pair of images have collected several laudable comments from co-decorators.
You're gorgeous.
We're on the same road, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project to do it now.
Your pictures give me terrible strength and enthusiasm, as one of them tells me that the journey is the same as the journey.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds on the project to do it now.
At that time, he told the Evening Magazine that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was ten pounds away.
During three months of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
Hope of the family of a woman murdered in Lowis: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim would be remembered by donating instead of flowers and petitiones for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's desire for donations in favour of police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed his nurse training there.
The Veterinarian Station recalls a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and job-free.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to the police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the evening newspaper that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The suspect in the murder, a 27-year-old man, did not know the woman and they had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest situation.
However, Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to reserve the salary of an employee who refused to teach a temporary agency worker, assessed the District Court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Post to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the tutor's salary, which corresponded to the share of orientation in all day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage under the Non-Discrimination Act on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Union of Posts and Logistics (PAU)'s Organizational Decision on the Ban on Education.
During the November post strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti employees would not familiarise themselves with agency workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first told about the matter.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Federation.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Secretary of State Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin dismissed the head of his administration - replacing the Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Chief of Presidential Administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin reports.
The farm is home to Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Persecution's grandson Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, reports the news agency Interfax.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's bulletin, Ivanov, who was part of Putin's tight inner circle, is taking over the special tasks of environmental and transport affairs.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other tasks and suggested Persecution in his place, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's reelection in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition of the gaming ban - not seen in the opening of the Premier League
The World Recorder of Football Transfers is not seen on the field when the England Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed along to England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition by Paul Pogba is on the sideline due to a ban on the game as ManU opened his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported the BBC on Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus EUR 105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was burdened by Juventus' ban.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the league's second round on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grand madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally prestigious event starred by the world's top artists.
Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says the artistic director of the event Thomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's rather unusual in the productions of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations, says Thomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 in the last year by 5,000 persons.
The festivals also present a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being controlled in huge corridors.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been swelled over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drinks bars in a partially artificial grass-plated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage, the concert venue this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
The Rock admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little bigot, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our thing anymore.
For the Rock, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for about EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR six million.
It can be used to produce "creasy things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is the legend of punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because now is probably the last time this is seen on a show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's been doing some damn good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
In Hua Hin, two bombs exploded locally on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and over 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began to leave bars and return to their hotels, reported police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra according to CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife patron in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish touristist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than, local time.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs were detonated on the island of Phuket, which was popular with Finns.
No one was reportedly killed.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trang City.
Police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently seized heavily on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will go to battle first in the event of war
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to battle until several months after taking a military oath, says the Central Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence, interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of conscripts serving 5.5 months in the event of war, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable.
According to the head of training, the first task is to recruit reserve personnel.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for an assignment that has not been trained as required," Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training garrisons for immediate readiness units starting next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola got the giant compensations from the mold house.
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The price of a two-storey separate house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious problem of moisture was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in order to be demolished in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, resulting in a financial loss of up to EUR 198 000 to Tola and Waroma.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both district and court courts.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of legal proceedings and liquidation of the couple for a total of EUR 47 344.
The right to moderate the price reduction slightly, as buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors revealed were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looked for a home in good condition
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and faults of ventilation and the lack of adequate control of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, it was not apparent from the discussions that there was any urgency at all.
Tola and Waroma remained in the impression that rainwaters coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The stores were made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than was thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, were due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the ground moisture that rose capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air was estimated by the inspector to be also accessible to the interior through the porch.
The mold or yeast that makes the health risk possible, beyond the limit values, was found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the windower in the living room, and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also argued whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that changes to the dwelling had been made in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were not yet any appropriate permits.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of information received from the seller prior to the sale, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finnish people in the register
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, have documents stored for microfilms regarding a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and registration cards come from a racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Racial Bureau operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted in women to find out.
The Bureau of Race investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the Racial Office handwritten biography and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Racial Bureau wanted assurances that women were "child lovers", "saved", and "good national socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, whether in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the Holocaust Museum of the United States.
Instead, Nazi demographic politics focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary cross of a German mother was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, the museum website states.
"Siren the Betrayer, 6th, Nirkko rose and fell"
Tapio Nirkko finished third in sailing at the first departure of Finnjollie's day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the top of the entire group as the top of the tail at the second departure of the day.
The nirk rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class day at number 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained number 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hung over"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the Finnish favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's bartender to the 1995 Tango King, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää can still bounce, and he is currently in a huge lift.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of the favorite singer, was released today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The bridgehead's career became a total uplift as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Bridgehead sang bars, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book reports that the recording of the song did not go quite as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that became a huge hit would not immediately be guessed that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the print was still good.
I learned that all the time you don't have to insist on being perfect and peaking.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, as reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner and the incident eventually ended up in the Texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song lyrics ordered from Sarah Törmäsä were not as Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the breakup song were not true, but was written on the basis of the news from 7 days.
The newspaper's news reported that Jar and his ex-lover's resignation was attributed to Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was total nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious with the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and so it was good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, although polls during the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics radiates in its latest monthly survey from the professional community responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economicists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently highlighted.
They were particularly grievanced by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much space to only a couple of percent of economists in favour of the EU distinction, as by the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hungry press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, and LSE and other economic power combinations are about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters, in their opinion, have no common interests.
The academics such as Economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrant congestions your hospital, Immigrant exploits you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in every cafe.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get a place of school if they were to be removed?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are held by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations for the victory of the "Plan B", a camp that is in favour of EU separation, began to be made in case the result was left behind.
The concern was that investors would begin to withdraw their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen about Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to old age, the standard level would be 15-20 percent.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trade
When the camp for EU separation won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, these looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old one, they did not actually close the store, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling the money out in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it's going to be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most withdrew the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Unfair attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate funds received excessive attention.
Open funds affected by closures dominate about four per cent of British properties.
Aberdeen's lockout lasted for six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might stick to the 2017 side of its fund.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been ragged downwards, but the situation does not look more "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The exchange rate of pounds and dollars is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought a negative impact on London's real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, things didn't look too good yet.
But at 4:00 when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in Aberdeen Asset Management, the British real estate fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word for power.
I realized that this is going to Plan B now, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight for work.
The City of London was already fully alive, despite the morning.
TV screens normally set to silence at the office made the news sound, and usually loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live," says Vanhanen.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdee, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished the two real estate transactions after the Brexit vote, i.e. Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had well prepared for the option, and therefore the situation was in a way calm," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the property market in Britain, especially in London.
In the coming years, the London office premises were forecast to be up to 20% negative.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tusk has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not show its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on Vanhanen's face.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what Brexit is going to do.
So much is still open: how the difference will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the subject of initial information.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minuses amounted to 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with Lehman's collapse and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
It's a different mood.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales of that time, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a normal fund-raiser.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, the price-fixing movement is no wonder to him - one could have been in front of Brexit without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of properties in London and other first cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a really high level.
London prices have tightened up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that the properties are the last ownership class to be globalized," says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
Moreover, prices have been boosted by low interest rates, which, for example, forced pension companies to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices leveled out last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change in the way we expected, and now it came.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
Much he dares not judge the future, but says that there is hardly a chance of a rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady road ahead.
Old man has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of its victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also spread," says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register purchase information more accurately than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you eat, as today the trading group said it was beginning to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once so far information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will begin to pick up it from purchased products at the beginning of May.
The S Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods bought with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing.
The most efficient channel is email.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to a change in the registration of the S group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to only grocery purchases into ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and there is no such programme for this time.
Finland's Near Finland has its own Onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with the Selection Houses, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We are not currently collecting data at product or product product level, we remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says Anu Ora, the commercial leader.
According to him, the customer loyalty program is scheduled to be reformed in the future, but the local store will report on this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
In the beginning, the experiment
SoK's customer-owner and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
The basic information includes not only personal and address data, but also occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-Etusi card purchase has a date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data are recorded at product group level so far in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, head of SOK's customer owner and partner operations.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in bags in any case, whether they want it or not.
A willing person can check his or her stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, the cashiers are unable to access the data, emphasizes the Sarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador Retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a can of powder gas-flavored shells.
The powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and main reasons for online trade
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main workplace in Heila because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused action at Customs and since the attacks control has been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
The second main reason for training the gun and explosives dog for Customs' duties is postal mail through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, as many as 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years at Helsinki Airport, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to arms, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials from online shopping, passenger aircraft's luggage and air cargo.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate recorded baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether additional weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits police and military experts to train with Heila.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as tranquility, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to go without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the evening Sanomat loses the mike cover of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cap immediately from the "irti" order.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog on the work vest, similar to Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
They have a working age of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work shares only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner was applied for about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
The mini-state got their first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
Fiji Olympic gold of less than one million inhabitants in rugby is valued in the country so high that the government has ordered the 22nd August national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was closed.
The day off is taken the day after the team's return home.
There will also be festivities for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded with his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 pounds (75 kg) of thrust and 145 pounds (145 kg) of rapture.
His combined score was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her push at the last 175 pounds, as was her second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by ferocious roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish farmer was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian attacker Prosan - Betting League - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a long-term contract with Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player on our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
With over ten player agents, we went through more than 50 players from around the world.
Little by little, the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen reported in the bulletin.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Statina Flora, where in 109 games he scored a total of 51 goals.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
There was a need for a new attacker for RoPS when last season goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star shone again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a friend of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphy, is once again flaunting by presenting her haughty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior considerably bolder.
The star has posed in pictures published in social media with very little clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce clothes.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see it, you can check it out here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomanTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood shape-shift" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and grew up in the Kardashians era.
He has learned that the more exposed the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-standing fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where he will be in ten years' time when the downhill is already so hard, says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
On the other hand, some of the women's fans defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women, glowing a young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fabulous mirör aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start the Northern Light Trips in early autumn," says Visit Finland in the press release.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Light Tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart winter and snowy landscapes.
The winter northern lights in Lapland are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light Season starts early in the autumn and goes on long into the spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirör aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twofold fabulous, says Anne Lind, acting marketing manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Northern Light Campaign is the wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among others.
According to a survey carried out by researchers at Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese could use clearer unique sights from Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have tremendous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than twice as much nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fid's master course leading to gold
Britain's impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed to the final challenge presented by Fiji in the Thursday night final when the team experienced a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master course in reading, bites, evasive action, support game, running lines, and pure force when he won the gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the defeat came a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - British Day's third - and they were allowed to be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, with which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory of the semi-finals previously played on the same day from South Africa may have bothered them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15-person team in this condition.
Great Britain may perhaps - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one British will have a gold medal on his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, former boss of England from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, they, coached by Ryan, lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here, they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started excellently, rejecting British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running into buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the target area.
When the clock had four minutes, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring third, but it was just a slowener for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu scored at the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for the new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravou crashed through the loose tackles of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the situation on the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
On the break, the UK made a series of changes that blocked the Fid Dam...for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was fine until Josua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive pitching game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for the UK while scoring a touchdown on the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the Islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with her final-minute goal had a frosting on Fidi's cake that did not need frosting.
The whistled, the Fidians hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semifinals 20-5, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semifinal, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts at the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured victory and eventually a silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer engulfed Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold at these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard tugs towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they rowed together, there were three votes on the boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time when the two were racing their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pair race - the first women in British sports history books to reach such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with a swan's sweetness, not fully depicting the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is backed by a group of helpful hand pairs who gradually advance the things that matter. And no pair of hands were as essential as a coach who, after 30 months ago after a cancer diagnosis, did not know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was a close-up.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, when they caused as little interference as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal fast.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thought of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain from the Royal Artillery Regiment of Afghanistan's deployment, said, "I've been a emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin, too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so she deserves a lot of thanks, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen shouted "permanent in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to get a good row and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this would be my last race.
That would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
This is where it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland trades the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by Panama data leaks already call for in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold a new parliamentary election in the autumn.
The election date is now set for October 29th.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring rage will affect the election result of autumn.
In June, in the presidential election, criticalness towards those in power was clearly shown, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran outside of politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest fuss.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and a Democratic candidate for the establishment of Hillary Clintonk's organization.
The Democratic Party became enraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink that low as a commander-in-chief of the army, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has prohibited the use of a burkini swimsuit preferred by Muslims on beaches, reports, among others, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing costumes, which display religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two extremist men connected to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Blue algae turret in Lake Pyhäkösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been observed on the beach of Lake Pyykosjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal in the seaside water of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the intervention limits.
Blue algae opacity observed at Lake Pyhösjärvi's beach does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the surface of the water as rafts.
Environmental action monitors the situation by frequent inspections.
If blue algae condensation turns into blue algae bloom, the bathing area will also be informed separately.
Check here for the results of the bathing water samples.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation of forest farm change.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax change proposal.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the VM assumes that a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry will prevent it from making a loss in the capital income of forestry which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot perceive it," says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners, according to him.
The tax deduction bound to the value of forest profits is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, he said, it eliminated 82% of Finnish forest owners from the area of deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the holding.
According to Hakkarainen, forestry policy has taken the reduction of forest gifts for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A strong hailstorm caught the motorists at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other

According to the rescue department, two consecutive cars derailed into a ditch, after which the one behind collided after the one driving ahead.
According to Harri Pyhätkä, the emergency firemaster, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind us had two people, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove the above was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga to a few miles to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantity of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medicine by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The research results have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
Muhos' family home killing continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder conviction for another perpetrator
The threshing of Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both of the doomed.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for family home killing at Muhos.
The second received 8 years for 4 months of killing and aggravated robbery, including as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a more severe man.
The prosecution calls for a milder punishment for murder committed as a young person to be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and had the young man come into his room, when one of the young struck him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the state of mind study, at the time of the act, both of the condemned were in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from a family home, at least since the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, growing only at the age of 156
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
The ice shark, or halker, that swims in the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by only one centimeter a year.
Only a species of bivalve molluscs is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Financial Wiseness - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if the change to corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax reliefs benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary while presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1 000 billion a year that would not be collected.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be re-established and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "Thought" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American aircraft to unite cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel to lift new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday Finnish time.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally tumultuous, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street riot - a reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarized the essence of the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy on the side, the preceding Skin where I live (2011) the peaks of a career in Spanish cinema.
On a level, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is the serene love, relationship and family drama of the conventional, centered on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen as much as a long flashback.
Life appears to be on its model for a middle-aged name character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed until the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, from the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will be added to the second female lead, TV-known from the series The time between the sutures (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a cuckoo, but I myself would say that time sly and literally with a single wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such distinctive blizzardness down to humor in Julieta has a fair distance.
It is a flatly played, restrained, place in places with good music and quite saddened film with elements of elegia as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish instructor is still present and gradually begins to put into the eye more as a pure form than as a working dramatic power.
The film’s characters are affected by diseases, deaths or otherwise only by sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is specific in these matters, but the main thing, or the tunings of the current scene, is not particularly improved.
When mechanical repeats, the impression is outward and somewhat inanimate.
Almodóvar has made the manuscript based on three short stories by Alice Munro, a Canadian who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally superior to the drama, the amount of big things - especially gnawing guilt - the film's the subject of the thematics.
Director and Screenplay: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiere is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
New cuts are not made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring are carried out in lots.
There will be no further surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is the conviction of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (secondary) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits debate.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
♪ The locals are haunting ♪
Why are the ministers so keenly emphasising the fact that no further cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result that takes the government parties in different directions will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, Gallupit reports that the Government Party of Peruvians expects a blizzard defeat, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, much of which next spring will be realised by the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of the three roughly equal parties depends on the ability of the basic Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
First of all, new cuts are not going to be used to obscure the fact that next year they will be brutally carried out and, secondly, to try to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Major Surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion into account next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise their hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts on the former ones in the 2017 budget run.
The budget would at least be dashed close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will receive what comes.
These measures do not give rise to deleveraging
It is quite clear that the current measures do not give way to debt, even though Juha Sipilä tries to stimulate a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the information conference on the budget prove this irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has barely risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion next year, which will in practice be fully covered by new debt.
This is the perception of the city centre, the assembly and the Finns of Peruvians as to what is responsible.
Poll: A lot of tasks are being left to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of child day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, as shown in the KAKS - Research by the Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the nation also rolls responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
Regional planning, special medical care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with mental disabilities are the most clearly desired responsibility for the region.
There is no desire to transfer any of the tasks entrusted to the state by the municipalities.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcycle rider from Joensuu ran off the police patrol in Joensuu at Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half-time.
Police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle running without lights, but a young man went on to drive the police out of fair speeding.
The chase continued on Sonkajanrantantie, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster - footed policeman ran after the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that would justify driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch at Kulvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved corner out of the road and fell into a ditch on its side.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the door above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle remained the responsibility of the car owner.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil ran into the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Lahti village of Ilmajoki in southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six feet [165 cm] tall, slender and good - postureed with white hair that extends under the jaw.
Observations and hints of lost movements are asked to call the Northland Situation Center tip number 0295440513.
The elements of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of Parafest damage
The crash flow that brought down the tents of the Parafest Festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially up and running, and the event can also be held next year.
The final performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared at the end of Friday night in a torilla.
On Saturday, the program continues with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The crash flow occurs in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward air flow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, thus cooling the air mass and accelerating its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of the crash flow.
The crash flow hit Parafest in the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child in the group who was transported slightly injured to further care.
Air pollution obsolescences Londoners
According to the study, the skin in London ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
A British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired people in London is two and a half years older than, say, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Small particles that aging the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to the Evening Standard, nearly 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel their business trips walking near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but regular cleaning of the skin is recommended as a practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further examinations seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Rejoice with renewed strength for the coming season
The League-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, leaves for the series starting in October for a better starting point than male memory.
The team's been together for almost three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in the previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienna.
Jani Säsäsä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as entrepreneurial and united.
From the foreign trio, the mid-defender Fred Musoni begins his second season in Rienno.
New faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared on the Rwandan national team, is a 2.5-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jampanen has played in almost all the Salbandy World Cup since 2003.
Now there are already sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salbandy national team.
I got interested, and here we are, Jumper, 48, says.
Jampanen was born in 1967 near New York in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumpernen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, a species such as Salbandy was not yet played at the SM level.
The telegram was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji hockey in the SM series, Jumppänen remembers.
Jampanen played the Salbandy SM series for the 1991-92 season in the club of the university, the following three seasons went on in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, with a balance accumulated in 169 games 51+34=85.
The most recent SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named for the national team
Josban of the Joensuu-based Salbandy club was raised by Perttu Puska and the uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which plays in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki Round, the offensive 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played this before six men's national games in which he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender of Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a femur and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 country games experience.
The national team was also named the pioneer player Mika Kohonen of the Seinäjoen Game Brothers, who was last seen in the Finland Shirt at last December's World Cup.
The head coach of the Salibandymaa team is Petri Kettunen, from Contiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing in the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is finishing as a beach volley player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volleyy Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in the series of both adults and young people.
In co-operation, the six best pairs of each series rankings are eligible for the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Volleyballists and the Finnish Volleyball Association.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki's YMCA, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get into the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven't played very often in adult leagues in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals around the corner, Hasu moods.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark for sport and gave good food for a fine hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine in Elimäki's NMCA girls' E.
Top of the head is too big a jersey, knee guards on ankles, and huge ace screams and choreographs after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were heavily involved - teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasuille beach volleyy was already a natural species choice during the junior era to counterbalance the indoor volleyball.
Songs have been played on the beach in the arctic pond since the 1990s.
In recent times, activity has always been active.
I also went to the juniors' SM tour sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together in the weekend with the beat-down student Annina Parkkine at the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realist goal, we have a medal.
SM-Golden we're still missing in the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the toe slippers will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu is planning.

Solomon’s Koli courageously became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, sweat and vigour.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Kol, started working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went on to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything will turn out to be all right.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition of a young food producer for Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost-of-living index was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million of its daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, a dog or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lens are simple, face-twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the application advertises blackface, or "blackface" mask, or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So this week, when Snapchat advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature from Asian people - "yellow face" or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem regarding diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature from Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others were strict in banning anime comparisons.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets of photographs were widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against comparison, with adjacent gross Asian caricature and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeanor.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trap wires.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And the huge audience of Snapchat, more racially diverse youths, can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image for the user, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be discreet than before".
Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and ended his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#Remove Snapchat)
"Aleither they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," the Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak frankly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to answer.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of his staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and take forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding, "Is it so that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay?"
Congressional panel said military officials were tampering with Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, a Congressional panel said that authorities from the United States Armed Forces military headquarters edited intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of a working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the Defense Power Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among the headquarters intelligence analysts who said that the superiors tampered with their assessment of American efforts to defeat Isis.
The Headquarters, known as Centcom, is a headquarters of the Armed Forces War Area in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs accepted by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified. They were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community agents," the press release of the report said.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - our fighters in the war suffered when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," spokeswoman Ken Calvert, California Republican, said.
Centcom's management failures reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that senior administrative authorities in Obama's administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it shows that analysts felt like Centcom leaders put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Over the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters's press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still held by ISIS.
"After months of investigation this is very clear," spokeswoman Mike Pompeo, a Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces military area headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters in order to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was manipulated.
The report published on Thursday follows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives released their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence evaluation of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," spokeswoman Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the release of intelligence returns", worsened mood among analysts and did not "give enough space for divergent perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said they could not find evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt their conclusions to "preset or political narrative".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reports that the Pentagon Superintendent has launched an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional Report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other repercussions than the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence officials are now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the military activities of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
A review of Islamic state intelligence reflects a controversy over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time wondering what the consequences of the 2003 attack would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding intelligence from the Islamic state.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker group concluded that despite the contrary public statements, air strikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic state had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery, however, was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be a over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, organizing a showdown with Britain
The day after having scored three goals with the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had previously done the same.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, who was still unbeaten after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game determines who ranks first and who is second in their six team.
The first ranked avoids a strong Dutch, leader of the second group, a little longer as the quarter finals begin.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have sparked up with their surprising success here, four years after they were left at the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played a sport in Drexel) joining the national team at age 16, when he became its youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well with him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work we have now in London.
We've turned around.
On Thursday night, Bam began the first half-time goalmaking with a knuckles near the goal.
India had come into the game with a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 levels until the end of the third round, when Bam took control of the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then toured into the middle and towed the ball to the finish, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth round.
This zero game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of the Trampoline in the midst of the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are on.
Rio de Janeiro's events seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton of communication passed from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor's conversation in the queue of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-timer and future heartbreaker with a smiler, could well be one of the names known to all who are presented for the best time and who are supported by sponsorship contracts and good mind TV ads - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympian flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Farther from the centre, partly in the shadow, are the species not generally accepted by all: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate issue of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the subdued charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, its presence in the past 16 years is so limited that many I interviewed did not realize at all that it was an Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medals.
Trampoline, however, is associated with a certain type of underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics in the uncivilized ear.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
The species has opportunities for amusement, as noted by the coloring of the endless bounces of cartoon films, but also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jump, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning a springboard.
The champions jumped on a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 ft, and must perform rolling motion sets (turns, folds, and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes compete from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those wishing for a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another grotesque boundary: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and can even lead the viewer to tears.
But that is also the reason why watching games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers you a moment of rest from this.
Trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no ferocious rush towards the end, no leaps into the distance, just a dreamy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 1 p.m. (ET), men's races will also come on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon software starting at 14 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic euphoria, they offer a quiet, charming moment, most likely not to be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as suggested by US male gymnasts some time ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just waits for his sighing new fanship.
"Growth shows its mind" in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as they spread to more and more regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses said the police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The spread videos recorded in protests, believed to be late last year or from the beginning of this year, show how security authorities beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' main human rights authority is now calling for an in-depth study.
"It was always difficult to hold this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
The American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
The Ethiopian economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, however, human rights organisations have constantly spoken of the oppression of the government, the opposition in that country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," Seyoum Tehome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are showing their minds.
One generation is showing their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition over land use in the stranglehold.
After the much-critic elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got a seat held by the last opposition and now holds all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more widespread and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better.
Oromot and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of Oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organize under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was especially qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Current administration has no basic instinct like that," conflict analyst Abdi said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the Tigers don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been run over by the government first and then robbed.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and for their remarkable advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal disdain of the Ethiopian government.
And now it begins to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there's real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-Based ISIS claim as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute that took over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he numerous times this week insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation made at the Wednesday evening campaign meeting, Trump increasingly argued the same in Thursday's interviews, where he insinuated that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said that he was only sarcastic.
The release was a complete reversal of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump shrug his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his hearing ears.
The most recent review storm comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign in the midst of the poll results that fall into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought as they talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the subject.
Running away again to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarify' in a direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cunning in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of alleviating his speeches for the large voter audience, Trump has been more gallant in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump drags after Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny over the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths defending the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about his veracity in relation to Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on the news media that grinds about his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to make him clear saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was unfit for president.
The previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the Bedford Avenue street shaft was too expensive for it.
The store, which replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps shaped like a cup cake.
Locals mourned it as the most recent loss in a middle-class town to be renovated.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is devastated and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new Verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of an old café who is the owner and CEO of a new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and purchased a similar type of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
There are bacon egg cheese sandwiches on the menu, and there are capers and browned onions on the tops, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they make fresh juices.
Within nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady flow of old regulars.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up his coffee drink for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to the coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink mixed instead of his usual ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully as of 2003.
He used to go there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge against a soap shop that took over old facilities.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make Verb a special soap that would be used as an ingredient for the café's cold-extracted coffee.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up soon on a point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-axed coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the adjacent building.
Many customers are satisfied with getting their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt as if he had come home while walking in and ordering coffee.
"I had longed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a cuddly mouth, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods such as foie gras, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
On that day his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life from a Lower East Side apartment house through food in his 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpretentious lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock exchange crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took the dose with turkey, potato purée and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression period.
"The murders were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, bean loaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe made a travesty.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in the stomach," he said.
In years before the recession, American tables, especially in rural areas, were like eating-so-much-like-jaksat pick-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing subject for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterious foods, such as mureks and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a wonderful way to use food leftovers", mentioned Ziegelma because the chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly rationed luxury product.
Special compilations were tried when calories and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research also for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits the fried onions.
This was characteristic of many domestic recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Released recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetators" and to meet the challenge of converting lumps such as blinded spaghetti and carrots into palatable rations.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical flavours.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake at your attitude.
At the same time that he publicly praised the simple, Iowa-based country food of his childhood, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire who had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in the almost gilded dining room.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only one of Washington's most dreary, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the paralytic eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The heritage is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she was unable to throw away food.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes an impressive name.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone unwittingly sank their spoons in a sticky, brown glider.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once and another.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the legal expenses it incurs in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments after they broke two Merck patents that joined Gilead’s success drugs Sovald and Harvon, a release that followed when an American judge discovered Merck’s abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict handed down on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to be relieved of the compensation it received in opposition to the suit.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, who dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed troops say they've taken over Manbij, completely controlled by ISIS.
The U.S.-backed forces have taken over the city of northern Manbij, which is entirely close to the Turkish border since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters who hid in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians held captive by fighters, from the Sharfan Darwish SDF Allied Force, Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 cost 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, showing that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charitable organizations, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book announcing his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia with his wife Anne Holton, published ten years of tax returns.
Their real federal tax percentage in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a hard contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, although the law does not oblige it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax government's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said on Twitter, publishing a link to the tax returns of a Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were ready.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has tackled the problem on Friday, publishing an online video that featured prominent Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: published his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that there have been no or very little taxes paid by Trump in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist borrowed numerous tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska's Omaha last week, Buffett, who is located there by the Berkshire Hathaway consulate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he also has an ongoing tax government audit, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investee was an affordable, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements, hurling animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservation, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use the nonviolent four-step way of protecting homes and hundreds of animals without being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the...tools, we have discovered a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguie, said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing a penetrating elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it does not stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and a firecracker, and then the condom is twisted so that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
Usually, one squawk is enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last means is a trigger that shoots into the air a Roman candle, a firefire producing a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed the Israeli area code at the request of Arabs
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to Arab customers' "requests".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary film about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in the German FAZ release.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country's area code list offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through his own telephone centre.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer there "shocked him."
The hotel's prescription boxist said it was a "considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand Israel's area code to be deleted," the employee reportedly said Lanzmann.
Israeli German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great wrong", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is in itself a great injustice.
But even greater shame is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gived up" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Get lost," said another publication that pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called what had happened "inconspicuous" and "apologize" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the speed dial list was never made," Kempinski's representative reportedly said after Suddeuche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students pointing at their minds
On Thursday, students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students met to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to break up the student crowd, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror over plans.
According to Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, little less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after protesters set out as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested for office, while the country's Senate voted on his impeachment charge.
RT business: Russian-Iran trade is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the abolition of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally one of the most important objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period of 2015, amounting to a total of $856 million.
Russian exports to Iran in particular rose by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"Commerce growth was achieved by delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will break," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner crashed into goal as the British captured cycling gold
Scottish Callum Skinner vindicated in the men's team sprint at the Rio cycling stadium last night when the British team's trio defended their title from London for 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in a role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the youth when he scored the polar victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing sixth in the March World Race Championship in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was replacing Jamie Staff, a special sender.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches held onto in view of the potential in the Scots that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel over gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held onto it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving with a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Glasgowian Skinner said, "Comparing is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best to make a name for myself.
In the finals, we set an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had intentionally fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment, and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem in the case of overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found contact in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic golds at one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (on that apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister) - the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be like Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time in a four-person, four-mile team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the time runs when officials invited him to a length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach the entire range of medals.
After presenting in Beijing and London truly exceptional and complete control, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which have been the resignation of the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the race career of major people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Great Britain now peaks at a perfect moment could once again be true.
The future of Portland's meltdown is questionable because of the cut in the electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victorian aluminium smelter, as well as jobs for hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company revealed that one of the plant owners is closing a distribution contract, so there is a cut in all distribution contracts to be expected.
The measure follows the decision made earlier this year by the Victorian administration not to extend the aid required to maintain the plant.
The aid for the 20-year period will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the factory being closed.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa was shut down by Point Henry's smelter, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland meltdown loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure is now following several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of the factory's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the operation of Portland plant to continue, which means that the non-melting physical electricity needs will continue," it said.
According to AGL, the contracts are so-called ‘protection agreements’ which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period and are therefore effectively terminated in 2017.
"For that reason AGL expects contracts to produce results for the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible performance effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook of the wholesale electricity price futures market.
AGL said that it has already "pre-empted termination" reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the unmelted supply of electricity".
An American company said that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement was supposed to come into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been wary of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the possible closure of the Togo factory near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts annually.
"If both plants exit the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us, as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality show star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the Mother-Manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's desired September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was modeling at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just a Kardashian style-fitting?), a scripted reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up's producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting his sister's cover, but ending with a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It is the cliché plot pattern of almost every "birthday" series of children's television series (Sacrest utters the lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn bunny boy), but Kris had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashians era with the September Vogue seat.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's lawsuit first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite original.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more similar to the coffee protocol than the fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Phashion it was calculated that 615 of the 832 page opus last year had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is expected so fiercely that for the last two years images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebs working as models" on the cover than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honorary position.
But if it happened that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "model of success" of his generation, would hit the first mentioned category, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of this moment."
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But spinning in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up cream.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took for the LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she is a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away each year
Over 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already far-reaching operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the extremes of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Community Legal Centers in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's Community legal centers are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the level of the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after the employee was alleged to be at gunpoint
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened the employee with a gun in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin on Wednesday at Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it would not happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "put out the pistol, put his right forefinger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the suit.
"There is no need to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the suit.
The challenge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger to tell the public in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" - which usually includes gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless control and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not reply to the comment request immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourish throughout the stomach, not only to local communities and across London.
For myself, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just as before the 2012 London Games, some come thinking that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
Obstacles are always to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and £ 211 billion in economic growth, both leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow who has implemented the £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and budget, remaining: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to execute a third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympic Games in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade, and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of Heathrow Board and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse games about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising programs are "cat and mouse play", said one of the companies producing such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads inhibitors on its computer-operated website, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update the program filters to block again ads on the social network's website.
Tuesday Facebook said that the code on its website is changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to discover which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog writing, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "a back and forth battle of this kind between the community that inhibits open source advertising and its orbiters has been going on ever since the invention of blocking advertisements," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of the great sadness that advertising blockers have become for industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, reported in last year's Pagefair and Adobe study, which is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the ad blockers on the computer pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work for the social network or Instagram on Facebook's mobile apps, the spokesman said.
Computer advertisements still bring enough revenue to Facebook to consider such an action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday Facebook said it daily its "administration" tool to give people more power over how to target ads to them.
Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block part of the site's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She was hit by a car on the Swiss freeway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in Vaud's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and settled in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles," the Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly attempted to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the event have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, reported by the police who appeal to them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
Crime investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to decide," Hofstetter said.
The two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which had a person walking on a dark freeway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, police were released from charges of manslaughter due to neglect after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court stated that the police, who were reacting to the emergency call, drove in a justified way, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus had once to be populated
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely once to be habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the hot, anhydrous surfaces of Venus and the air frames filled with carbon dioxide could sometimes have been subject to earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at early Venus's surface formation.
The planet probably had more drier areas than the Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 - percent darker sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation reveals it to the sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news bulletin.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface largely from the sun’s heat.
As a result, average temperatures in the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of the evolutions of Venus, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably sometimes habitable, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases, Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche coach job
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of hockey affairs, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Vice President/Chief Joe Sakic of Colorado confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice-President and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During the summer I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the Vice-President of hockey must be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him well in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the win of the Central Division, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to finish in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended in 39 wins, 39 losses, and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference's wild-card playoff slot.
Hall of Fame selected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
Industrial battles of North Sea oil workers for wages will be postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have been occasionally arranged on the North Sea drilling rigs run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process to resolve the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year Wood Group cut fees for North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10 per cent reduction in its country contractors for 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the necessary room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from their payrolls and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is aggravated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labour disputes of the generation.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the previous five-year average has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Plejads' stellar corps
The latest Kepler Space Telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the rotational speeds of the Plejads' starbase.
The new information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the constellation rotate at varying speeds, as well as how rotation times are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Caltech's researcher Luisa Rebull of the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis said in a press release
The Plejad constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their top level now.
At its peak speed, these growing stars plunge large amounts of starwind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by following the appearance of identifiable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the bigger ones making devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the plejads, we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Plejads' stellar array is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of the stars at rotational speeds.
"The Plejads' stellar corps offers anchor for star rotation in theoretical models that comprise both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad rotation speeds in three articles published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
