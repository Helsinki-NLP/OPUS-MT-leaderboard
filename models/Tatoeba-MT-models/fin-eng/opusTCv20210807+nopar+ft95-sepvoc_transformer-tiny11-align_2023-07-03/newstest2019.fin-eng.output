Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane's home win in opening - Savo Volley another win
As many times in a row, Hurricane Loimaa, who was on the men's volleyball Championship medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective in Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then the call came from Loimaa.
We got the job quite quickly, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played like Kouk, too, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team applicant playing on a match-specific contract with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought additional extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but continuing the medal tube is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most powerful
Miro Määtttänen was Savo Volley's most powerful by 18 points when the team fell by next to Vantaa's Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially at the attack head, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the win.
I had no conscious different download when I played against my former team," Määtttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3 series, who started his career in the season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good feeling was left at the home opening.
Miro was a king, Sillik played a good game," Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo while Tuovinen was then head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's trade in 2012-13, has started this season strongly as well.
The hacker scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win for the season after pouring Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well at its own point.
Today was a loss near, for we were down for the fourth round 17-21.
We dug up a round win, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most powerful Tigers, which was still in the finals a few seasons ago, was 28 points pick-up Edwards Buivids.
The countryman Aleksandr Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
There was little hold on the guy's chipper, Mikkonen said.
Finland in the comparison of human capital in the world's number one
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
During the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was ranked one higher and Taiwan was found instead of Canada.
In 2016, the worst comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into great cheers, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico while being a Chelsea player.
In the early part of the week, the International Football Association FIFA chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
At Real, the best finish position was Gareth Bale, but his shot was over at the end of the goal's opening half.
Bale stayed after a break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus in the game.
In the United States, abortion rights are now being attacked - A powerful documentary says why
The US Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump's candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice will be refuted by the decision known as Roe v Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell us how to come to the current situation over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received various levels of support from most of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to extortion of the laws.
The armed guard of the clinic says he is defending religious freedom in the United States.
News videos are similar to the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died for self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States a year.
The Republican Party was especially defended by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, the abortion law in California was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, a turning point began to confuse religion with politics to seek out voters.
His abortion strain also fainted his successor George Bush, the Elder.
And the same was done by Donald Trump.
To the deepest core of the matter, the documentary reaches in search of the ground cause for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations that supported segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the president, which has been praised by his sexual harassment, but the president who caught the voices of the religious right on his abortion has chosen Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, which several women now accuse of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on a scale-language position to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - major protests at border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
Among the dead are two children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: boys aged 12 and 14.
The ministry said 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an airstrike in the border zone as protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The military says it started using force so protesters will not break down the border fence or pursue it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 are wounded.
Protesters called for Palestinian families access to areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the Israeli state was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's toper Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penal area.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was pure.
Teemu Santa could not believe his eyes.
I think the situation remained to bother referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich a penalty kick by the 85th minute when Santa was poured.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
The work tasted for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-profit tube behind.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteen.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Those who are sexually interested in children or young people have so far had difficulty getting help.
The Serial Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo's joint SeriE project trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in the spring, an email flood began at Sexpo, which offers advice and therapy, and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children causes shame for many.
Most of those who notice pedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that harass and discourage them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist for Yle, who is a specialist in the project.
I think work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolesian gynecologist?
US President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange suddenly, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to receive the award based on betting odds.
Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of speeches, is committed to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites for the Nobel Prize for Peace have, based on odds, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between his countries.
The warming between the Koreas is considerable, as last year the gap was still chilly.
Yet, the reward of Kim, which was threatened with nuclear weapons and leading its country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday is the most important, or peace prize.
If the prize is not given to participants in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is the Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there are 331 candidates to be awarded the award.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel Prize.
In May, the reporter asked him if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued with reference to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often acknowledged people and organizations representing liberal democracy and multifaceted world order - the very kind of international cooperation Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So reward Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire announcement in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like harmony and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in the number one in Lohja took place on September 8.
The traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki due to the announcement.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department sought to make traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it couldn't be opened because there are motorists on the road and they drive how it hurts, on-call firemaster Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, Liikenne, the contact manager of Liikenneturva, is amazed.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels should only stop for compelling reasons.
Road security reminds us that in exceptional situations, you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always allow as unhindered access as possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is making a u-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels, where the headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is of course parking.
There have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that it is the wrong place and time for this operation," Heiskanen said in a statement from Liikenneturva.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the lakebed
Ilves fans carried by the inland water ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue at the victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed, says Juho Syrjä, who was the head of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, who was traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the haver.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them on a fire department ride to the port and bus home," Syrjä told the STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to follow the Ilves and HPK match, which ended with the 4-3 win of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's haver was due to the fact that the water surface in Vanajave water was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered with log droppings, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collision
Havi took place west of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had subsided the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The larger drama was not associated with the case, according to Syrjä, as the ship's speed was very low at the time of the incident and the hit on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
The bottom has no leaks or prints to the bottom, and the ship's cruises continue normally.
The diver went on Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship began towed off the shallows.
We will go to the shipyard just to check that this did not cause any damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The cruise season of the ship will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue services were alerted to the incident on Saturday night, just half past 12.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Firemaster Matti Willman said late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and rather hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three on Sunday night that all those on board have been evacuated and passengers have been moved by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge candidate accused of harassment and drinking may be left without top office
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge of the United States Supreme Court, may well be left without the post he is pursuing, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump could end up playing another person in office.
It has occurred in the United States from time to time that the president's candidate for Supreme Court judge has raised a lot of conflicts.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, Aaltola says.
This is how the president has been able to maintain his face.
The appointment would rain on the Democratic Laari
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain to the Democratic Party laari in the forthcoming mid-term elections of Congress, according to Aaltola.
It would raise the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment is not awarded to every presidency, as in the United States Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80.
Some Republicans also hesitated to name
The candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court judges are normally subject to background clearance, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a week's deadline for further investigation by the FBI, it can still bring up something essential, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it might bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least, it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility to the post will be discussed in a lively manner before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the appointment to be taken to the vote and Republicans lose.
Woman recognizes Salisbury suspect as agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service suspected of poisoning.
The woman said, based on the photographs, that it was Anatoli Tshephiga, a military intelligence working at the GRU.
Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they had revealed one of the suspected men from poisoning to Chepeiga.
They said they had found evidence that men's current identities are cover identities.
The BBC group traveled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-China border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village recognized the photos published by young Chepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from British police images featuring a man who called Ruslan Boshirov himself today.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve poison in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the decoration of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect's GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning reported in an interview with Russian TV earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly as throwing bags in war reform
Now we have a living example of what the restriction on the change in the health and social services reform defined by Sipilä's government means.
My birth municipality Vaala's health care services are produced by the Oulunkaare Municipal Authority, whose former Regional Director of Attento has been elected as the Health Service Director in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal board warn the council of the change limiter.
If war spending now rises, municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipal centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would stop institutional care for the health centre's bed department and a small unit of memory disorders.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages are teared from roots next to the health centre as "at home" for treatment.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay it customers.
The Vaala left did not swallow bad preparation, but held a good public event, which became a lot of relatives, caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with slides of the Social Affairs and Regional Council Convention how the elderly are already most treated at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia at home.
There was also a neighboring councilman Carina Läntinen.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it again brought Oulukaar's drafts to its hind legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
Rapporteurs only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell us what level of treatment it receives or with what kind of staff structure Attendo will treat the elderly until hospice treatment.
Without a nurse?
The site of the health centre is stopped because there is no doctor's night emergency services.
Attendo will also resort to doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example shows how downtown officials run delegates with incomplete knowledge and delegates are injected against the wall with a change limiter.
This way the Centre Party clears Vaala's residents, because who will remain there voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was there one election statement in the city centre that the whole country will be held inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens major mosque in Cologne
In the city of Cologne, Germany, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan supporters had also gathered near the Great Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area from the environment of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised that his visit to Germany was successful and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday to rebuild relations between the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia State Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to a demonstration against Erdogan in Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed, and subjugated.
For Erdogan, everything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three charges of murder of journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecution said on Friday that three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, eight people were arrested by police in the investigation of the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found in February shot with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's reports.
The case and Kuciak published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with Karelian distribution on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the fault of printing, Sunday Karjalainen also has to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to common boxes has to be performed from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra news bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of the rest of the Finnish subscribers will not be mailed separately until Monday.
Distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala in his upcoming discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio about his upcoming space trip, which he booked Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after a unlucky test flight that occurred in 2014 and who claimed the death toll, things are in the hole.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start in this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, meaning his journey is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km altitude, the Finnish astronaut says about the future on its website.
At the same address, he also reflects his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book magazine called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on TVs.
Star wars have been seen and that's what the idea was smoldering...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host
Manchester City continued its loss-free passage in the Premier League when it poured 2-0 on its home field on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by the goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season at close range to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him on the back of Brighton's goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he sawing with Sterling into pieces of Brighton defense in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 final readings at the penalty spot easily.
City, which started six wins and one draw, leads the Premier League with 19-point catch.
However, Liverpool, who played one match, lurks only one point away.
Liverpool will face a series three Chelsea in their own seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At their meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Society selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen was elected as Vice Chairman from Häme.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was amazed at Ferrari: "Los a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked if he believes that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel at the World Cup points by 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari reported that Räikkönen will not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian race.
The race starts at 2 p.m., Mercedes's Valtteri Bottas leaves the race.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football A-young SM-series championship campaign became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league level for football boys ends on Saturday, when the last round of the season is played.
Before the round that started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough for first mode in practice against Vasa IFK.
To turn the situation in the last round, the second Ilves in the championship campaign must win the PK-35 and hope the defeat of the Lahtins.
However, the Lahti Championship was practically confirmed even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vases, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the break, the Lahtians led 7-0.
One reason for the stake of the Vaasians is that the team has played partly with the same players the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the men's Two-block C.
Vasa IFK has played in Two against the fall of the whole season.
In the final round of two on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own guest match against KuFua in Siilinjärvi Toivala.

Supo expects new ways to reconnaissance: Device purchases and recruitments have already been made, the activities designing abroad are not a shock
According to Antti Pelttar, Supo's chief, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by doing equipment procurement and training staff.
When intelligence laws came into force, an increase of around EUR 10 million would be permanently added to the reduction budget.
The operations of the Protection Police (supon) in Ratakatu, Helsinki, are already preparing a full head for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of Supo's composition, tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams starts with a video where she sings topless - campaigned for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shone again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account singing only hands in front of her breasts, reports AFP.
The song is the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian The Divinyls.
Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I wrote The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-help [breasts] checks," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in the discomfort area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of skin color all over the world.
Early perception is a and o - it fears many lives.
The Divinyls' second author is Chrissy Ampphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a controversy in the US Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted much more violent behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain path is not suitable for height combs
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located on the cliff's ledge.
You can look at the forest that spreads below if you wish.
The steep scenery in the heights causes restaurant visitors to gasp their breath in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19 September 2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant's toilet is located.
Hiking at the restaurant requires good bottom condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, the domestic country drama Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.

The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is warm, in light of recent events, it is downright romantic, but then Laiho appears in the patterns once again.
Police are also in favour of a man.
However, no one can sense Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, learns amazing news.
The last will of the far comes out, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, Sunday evenings will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow for a small flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people will stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem small, says the Prevention publication.
So, is it worth staying home?
Prevention says the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is already transmitted a day before symptoms begin and from then forward from five days to week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or at work.
You can return to work when the cough eases and there is no fever anymore," says Gregory Poland, a medical professor.
Training is also worth avoiding.
Too fast a return to the gym slows recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, throw the handkerchief and throw the snot papers in the trash.
Painful moving anyway?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
How, then, could you avoid infections?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouths every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey player and Misses are often associated.
This was also the case at Alina Voronkova, 23,.
The 2018 Miss Finnish krona has been awarded by Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Inkerin Finnish and his father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied by my father's Russianism at school.
My mother and Father have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina says at the Miss Suomi competition's semifinalists' announcement.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the Miss Beauty found new friends and the everyday life went rolling as desired.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when I thought about afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans ranks.
Since his career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-olds World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and with it, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, we have confidence well and there is the good thing in a remote relationship that it remains the initial pain all the time, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth's resilience.
Yet you don't want to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives are sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of a moderate economy comes across major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people over a few generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living, which could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-term crossing of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change will cause this market economy to waver threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on the night before Sunday at Sitrator at four a.m.
The man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, less severe, born in 1968.
An older man has already been released from the hospital.
Police have captured one person whose possible share of the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
Events are investigated as an attempt to kill and aggravated assault.

Lehträ showed its underpower expertise, the slot is not yet sure
Jori Lehtä's strong underpower gaming emerged when his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played his last practice match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehträ fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In recent days, Lehtärä has been on display due to suspicions of drugs.

Lehträ has denied committing a crime.
The club and the player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimated that Lehtärä is a member of a group of six attackers, five of which will get a seat on the NHL team.
In the exercise match, Lehtärä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehtärä fought the puck for himself underpower, pulled the defender, and fed Raffl to the open place that waited in front of the goal.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4 with a guest match against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for a team coaching management solution to see if he can join the NHL group.

I think I'm ready for the NHL," the Horizontal said in an interview released on Boston's Twitter account.
In the river boys, Vaakanainen played against Philadelphia for 19:31 minutes.
At Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.

Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Kosk.
Alexander Barkov, Florida, played over 20 minutes and pitched the goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.

Fresh picture shows change: The world's strongest man lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is going through a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories worth of food a day and weighed 200 pounds, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were a size of 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he would do harm to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the win of the world's strongest man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if you got the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram where he poses a lot of his active career in a milder condition.
Hall writes that its current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he was now training aerobically in a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
Hall also does four trainings per week in the gym.
This year, the world's strongest man was the Icelandicman, also familiar from the Game of Thrones TV series, Haf ór Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere rushed to aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Satisingly closed with rock"
The inland water ship M/S Tampere drove to the rocks late Friday night in Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue services were alerted to the water traffic accident on Friday night after half past twelve.
The 30-metre ship M/S Tampere has drifted to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock, said firemaster Matti Willman.
The ship was equipped with 19 passengers and five crew members.
The rescue services said personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland out of the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus ride towards Tampere, the on-call manager Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viila to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
Firemaster Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and rather hard wind.
The rescue services say the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship is apparently not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers will begin to check what the situation is at the bottom there.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum allowable number of passengers of 180 people.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand outstanding fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius's game against Erkan Teper overshadows a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on the challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LLM Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius, with interest on late payment, is charged a total of over 80,000 euros in unpaid management fees.
According to the application for the challenge, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done," Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti, which tells the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Resistance, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in an economically awkward situation to Helenius and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsors for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay only percentages of her matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius did not have to pay for anything, just to receive the income they provide.
This is also a normal and only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and that would have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
No written agreement was ever made for cooperation.
According to the opposition, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until late 2014.
He said the proposal was poor on his own behalf and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought with Kokkila and Helminen once.
A year after the cooperation ended, Helenius had been assigned an "unindividual but extensive" bill of the manager's work.
This year, a lawsuit has been filed with the same claims.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila to be cowardly, the counterpart states.
Helenius today meets the boxing alliance IBF's heavyweight challenger list in the seventh Erkan Teper Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer at the age of 83.
The plotter's death announcement was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement reports that Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on its Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, whom was saddened by knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He left a farewell on Facebook earlier, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll a multi-talent expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that Päll was a liked person with fast hookers and funny stuff.
I got to know Erk as a little boy for the first time when I was 12 years old and started there as a warehouse man.
We met with Erk at the time.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnlade and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I progressed to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a standard editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a heartfelt man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked at Fazer record company Toivo Kärje in addition to supplier work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, Päll's biggest passion was radio work, in which he had a original style.
He was doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year that ended in May of the union showed a profit of approximately 450,000 euros.
The union describes the "full translation" that has experienced its economic situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by "the significant debt in balance".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, making adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management of operations have been instilled throughout our organization, Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also been successful in partner acquisition and, in addition, the World Cup return was maximum during the past season.
However, in the future, cost management must be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital backyard in the town of Palu on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled for assessing the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of those who was in the hospital area was the 52-year-old Palulainen Baharud, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I last spoke to him when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP.
In the yard of the Army Hospital, Dwi Haris lay in Palu, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel at the start of the quake with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the Return Wedding Festival.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe," Haris told the AP, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed
At the Palu evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a young baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tights.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many people of Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is so standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants under them.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
The paper said the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards had forbidden them to leave to find their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first, an army C-130 transport machine landed on the field, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land on the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night against Sunday, a long rainy area spreads across the entire country, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in central and northern Lapland, a slag or snow is expected.
The sore frosts of the previous night are not repeated because the temperatures under the cloud cover remain higher.
A more cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively under control.
In the west, you can visit the frost side momentarily," said meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will give way to the east during the morning.
There are pout or semi-clouds in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu height at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week seems similar in terms of temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in the marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be varying weather for the typical autumn.
Autumn is starting to push on seriously," Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final is not seen on TV
From IL-TV, you can follow the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
Entertainment journalists in Iltalehti are running live broadcast from the Red Mat of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs ironworks on IL-TV.
The broadcast starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned from ten finalists on Saturday.

Other representatives of the jury include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jouni Trade CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before going to the Miss Games
Russian Dimitri father and Inker mother Svetlana believed in her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Finnish Alina Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly followed their daughter's first moments at the end of the crown.
They happened to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, although she has lived in Finland throughout her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many things other than in Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty that I should start to miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about beauty contests.
The parents' wish was that Alina would enter the university before attending the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to do a bachelor's degree before the Miss Games.
We asked last year why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish that cand.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because he is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He sports a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be featured, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri hockey in Japan for a living and couldn't encourage love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a year.
Yes, that's the intention!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break now for visits because of the Miss Skiers.
I miss it, even though messages have been put in.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - I think of the idea of comic: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organic nonsense once left my husband's phrase, where he suggested it to the story I developed as a person, says Espoon comic blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says he was an EU translator in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind what you would do when the smallest child was already getting big.
Then a comic book came into the 2014 picture.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintt and Asterix since he was a kid.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these organic nonsense began to arise then, the situation changed.
I first made some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled cartoonist, but I couldn't attract her until in the summer of 2016 when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing record.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying for himself, laughs Piippo, who tells him that the record was a great incentive for him.
The drawing plate is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually engages in at night.
The scripts pop into the mind all the time, but I don't usually do ready at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert for contemporary comics in newspapers.
The people of organic nonsense are a carrot body mother who has a salad hair cover.
The other people are the Man, the Piss, and the Twins.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer forced buns even though the Organic Fump sometimes stuffs it.
Piippo says he read his series with his husband and children.
It is such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you draw and say that this is what I have done today.
There are plenty of challenges for a housewife!
The organic nonsense series can be read online at organichomppa.com

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - not left a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe
The Indonesian earthquake has become 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from the island that shook the earthquake.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
As others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave its place before being able to control the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway to air.
This way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to rescue by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a aviation administration spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight reached the air, and 7.5 magnitude was eventually measured at its intensity.
At least 832 people lost his life.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered Europe's end in the trade war: "I have to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that while tightening tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the exports of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is a very miner so far.
It has been able to build an actruce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted drastically yesterday to a clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
5% of the country's loan stock is problem loans and unorganized credit is over 10%.
In addition, its public finances are in weak positions and the country again seems to exceed its commitment in relation to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue affecting Europe is Britain's resignation from the EU.
Rehn hoped it was in harmony.
The dispute between the difference would become much more negative effects.
Rehn started as the President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from his position in just over a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in speeches.
It doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he would not comment on the matter further than this.

There is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki night, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the Black Box producers.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded as a journalistic act of the year at the Bonnier gala.
The awarders thanked a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The spring season 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be seen at that time has different content than this autumn nights.
Lost mushroomer found thanks to "prelimin-free experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is the world's top: "We are being asked about training"
According to the principal of the Police University of Applied Sciences, police can use the drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigation and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom driver in Raahe in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, principal of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "with the help of free trial and effective education, we are the top of the world here as well."
Drone is a fairly new thing and even later on police missions.
There is no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been discovered, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
It becomes even more common
Himberg reminds us that finding the lost in winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in Raahe's case, the lost one was found with a drone in just a few minutes.
Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they are to be trained more.
Already, drone is used a lot in police tasks, and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
That is what I would like to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing people, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigation and certain types of intelligence missions.
For example, we already have to check an area a little further away, where it may be feared that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Rugby of Karelia rose to number one divar
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss for Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and whispered the guests of the south 26-12.
The 2 Division Championship also knew the historic rise to Division 1 for the Karelian Rugby.
Previously, the club has played at number one, but at that time Finnish rugby series activities were divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club plans to accept the serial place, but it will know quite a job next winter.
The current monster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so fundraising must also be in line with it.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of Montreal Canadiens in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start a season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super proposition in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round with number three summer drafts.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong excerpts in the September practice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score immediately in his first practice game.
Head coach Julien praised that the Finn took big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season will begin on the night against Thursday of next week, Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week, there has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland.
Nokia's Chairman of the Board of Directors Risto Siilasmaa told HS in an interview with his book Paranoid Optim, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but even previous Nokia reports have spoken of the leaders' inability to act as a team; fear and non-spoken, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rise risk-taking and agility disappeared.
In a week, Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars of the business world rose to the stage.
There was enough talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, a legend of leadership doctrines, said that a good leader must dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most mentally tied to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the Whole Foods store chain, known for a wide range of organics, said the manager must know how to communicate with the entire staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose can't be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book on introverts, said that the most successful leaders are humble.
They act calmly, quietly and determined.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodara, a professor of finance, pointed out that the characteristics of a good leader must coincide with the company's life cycle phase.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must know the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A lot is required of a good leader.
That's why leadership goes wrong so often, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in the scenes comradely.
However, they hardly wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And it was not easy for an outsider to judge their humility.
Sara Chafak arrived magnificently on the red carpet directly from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived in a miss final in a magnificent black dress.
The 2012 spectacular dress in Miss Finland also had a lace roast.
A little poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says his news.
Chafak says he's going to go to L.A. for auditions.
He has made advertising descriptions, among other things.
In the United States, he describes his work as interesting, and also similar to those in Finland.
However, he says that work must be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The award is given annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police found a Volvo looking for in a major operation: "We can't tell you where"
The extensive searches of the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed by the Sound and Iso-Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlanti were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The searched car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm, a Copenhagen police statement tells Ilta-Sanom.
Storm says the wanted black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
He said the greatest danger is over.
Extra Bladet from Denmark reported a police briefing on Saturday.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the course of the operation.
He didn't want to tell you what criminal title to investigate.
Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police won't tell if they've already been caught.
According to the paper, ferry traffic restrictions have been cancelled.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, the STT says that the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people will vote on the matter in controversial elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the Macedonian and Greek Governments agreement, the Republic of North Macedonia would be called the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by adopting the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the deal.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
The name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has become independent in 1991, has been used in official contexts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is enough to stress whether the voting policy will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocks Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match late Saturday night in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF Association's heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner can be opened up with the opportunity to fight in tougher positions seen on Saturday, whose financial significance is considerable.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round, when she knocked Teper out with his hard left-hand blow.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper first met in the ring.
They had to fight as early as December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
It then turned out that the German had been fried twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 games from her professional career matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who has left the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton team order to win - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title approached its confirmation again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup line to Sebastian Vettel, Ferrari, as early as 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pile position of the race, drove second.
Last year, Bottas, who took up his career in Sochi, held a top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, which started from the last line of departure, was fifth.

Two men assaulted and kicking a 31-year-old juukaist man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also usurped the victim's phone, among other things.

They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruises who did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will leave his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue as Tesla CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to achieve harmony with Nafta with U.S.
Time threatens to end in the middle of the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations to the fullest.
At President Donald Trump's demand, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans to sign an agreement at the end of November - Canada was involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to leave enough time for the United States Congress to assess it.

Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - squeaking on the field and at the metro station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league in Espoo, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to the STT.
The basis for the arrest was protection against the crime and disorder.
The arrested ones were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The arrests were previously reported by the Evening News.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from the stands reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fist fighting between team supporters.
Among other things, horse police officers were needed to end the situation.
In addition to the field, there was congestion in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw of the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the graining on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been made as a result of the events.
Tablestone was alarmed by butterfly swimming in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Stone have progressed to the final day of the World Swimming Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The games are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone was alarmed by Finland's record at 50 metres butterfly sailing, where he was second in the early instalments in 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swims in Helsinki for the season 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was a butterfly sailing in 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was the sixth in the early batches of 50 metres chest swimming in 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
In the early batches of two hundred metres of confusion, Laukkanen was 15th in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: ancient tragedy - reduced Oreste affects their visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen the ancient tragedy, Sophockleen Filocttes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only entire play trilogy of ancient times, Aiskhylus Oresteia, to the tour beginning from the National Theatre.
In Lavat open! projects that started in 2015, the actor students at the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, as the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roiha's atonement for Orestia summarizes the story of the end of the blood revenge of the Atreus family of destruction and the birth of the rule of law to an hour for twenty minutes, especially by intensifying choir sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simon great translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the pages of the theatre space highlight reduced and bright stage thinking.
Its center alternately features the dynamics between the choir-off performers, and the choir that break away from the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple implants from name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who is returning from the Trojan War, and his spoil of war, are also shown on stage, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation is created before the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out the master's stage of acting students as a close group, just one organism, a rhythmic crowd.
Especially in choir sections, actors who bend into very expressive, sculpture-like group formations get their rights on the bare, only by adorning a white curtain, on stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen frost
The novelty is beginning to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to a cooperation agreement with Hyindai and Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA Commercial Vehicle Exhibition, Hyundai will supply a new model of a 1,000-car batch for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing a fuel cell-powered truck Hyundai continues on the road signed by Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refueling network, said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor.
The fists flashed several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and off it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
Police caught the assaulter.
At the police station, the man still behaved aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
This is being investigated as three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
There was also another assault case in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The victim was beaten by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kayan man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who hit him still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assaulters further away from the victim and police were called.
However, the perpetrators had time to leave before the police arrived.
Police are asking witnesses to contact Kajaani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email at investigation.kainuu@police.fi.
Long-line radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going.
The doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The security of the aunts and uncles of the store must be guaranteed
I first received a newspaper story in 1984.
When these year rings make a topic amazed, it's usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to the story Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert for the Service Industries (PAM).
He says criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly serious and many of the correct violent situation are not reported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to statistics their close-term situation under the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain in internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up with statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violent situation and the threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when even aggressive threats of a certain level must be counted as violence - even if there is no way to tackle.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even though the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
Even when trade opening hours were released, there was a visible nonsense in the media about its impact on sellers' safety.
"Then quite a lot of employers provided guard services for at least night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä said.
When nothing happens, a wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well under control, the image arose that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff crime, and it is quite understandable that the abused seller does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But according to the same subparagraph of the 2011 law, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle in the store is beaten, the police should be investigated and the prosecutor accused.
When the court put a few assaulters in prison, and the verdict from there for a hard-paced scale would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery store must be open in small places almost day and night, must guarantee the safety of the workers in the store.
Heidi Sohlberg signed to Miss before the live broadcast began - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's coronation is not seen in the traditional way on TV this year, but the broadcast is shown by Viafree.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet host is Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the broadcast.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a sled applause.
Now all women scream!
Look at this male host of ours, Sohlberg praised his colleague as the audience cheered.
Many of the piers are followed by many of the previous years Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg comforted looking towards Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
The kidnapping spoke of his divorce for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomat weekend magazine.
Missikaunotar told me that he did not want to open the causes of the divorce more closely in public, as that is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry to a new relationship, he is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own stuff and especially start living my own life alone," Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally mistaken to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The spelling guy laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, wasn't it?
Janni Hussi signed a screw.
The Northern Man tortured his bound cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has condemned a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for numerous crimes against his cohabiting partner for three years in prison.
The crime-making tool was a belt, cable and cable ties, among other things.
The court sentenced the items in question to the state as lost.
Ranki's charge was suspected of aggravated rape.
However, this charge was rejected by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two damage were attributed to Kokkola.
The crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the last actions, the man was captured and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued his sentence and ordered a 34-year-old to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were rejected by the court unproved.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
The district judge said the accused had directed violence, threat and coercion to his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned with tobacco, fed strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By his sentence, the court confiscated the state with criminal equipment: belt and cable, bundle ties, bathrobe belt, knife and locomotive.
Four witnesses
The district court said the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It can be read from the judgment that a large part of the most outrageous acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, aching, suffering and temporary harm of a total of 5,800 euros.
He hardly has that money, because the sentenced person already has debts in recovery.
The prison penalty is not a man's first.
The evening newspaper does not state the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent district sentence is not final when writing this.
Europe as a four-point leader for Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals held their leadership in a traditional hole game match against the United States on Saturday.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup around Paris with points 10-6, while twelve doubles are still in front on Sunday.
Europe won three of four four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon four-game, the wins were leveled 2-2.
Europe's lead stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games played as Friday and Saturday during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same.
On Sunday, the two are seeking more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cup, and only three players have been able to do so: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning its supporters' disruptive behaviour at a Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge a dispute with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The officers did not calm down the situation, but police officers and also horse police officers were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team's players and staff members are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are strongly saying out of any activity that endangers the security of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organizers to investigate factors that threaten safety and eliminate adverse events.
Supporter culture is part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, joyful and supportive activities in football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies with drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now a member of the world-growing group that vows to have invented a flying car, or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in the mass production of its device.
According to reports from the world, he has used much of his property to build his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he slipped on his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will evoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action that starts tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, overtime and shift change bans will be particularly visible in social and health services and in children's day care, estimates JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to wonder how to apply for their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that no one's lives are threatened," Niemi-Laine told the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of workers was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift exchange due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that staff have not been hired, but employees have been overtime or exchanged shifts.
This is not yet a industrial action.
It is the norm, in terms of occupational safety and health, that for each employee, regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to reduce the redundancy protection of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, labour market leader of municipal employers, will not pre-evaluate the effects of overtime and shift exchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so impossibly extensive, social and health and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employers, Jalonen told the STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience with the similar three days of activities lasting three days, among other things, the Association of Local and Local Nurses and the Social and Health Trade Union.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL's ban on overtime and shift exchange applies to workers in municipalities, church, state, and private social and health care, among other things.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial struggle concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL may take a long time to act.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Redundancy Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is running to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
It is special here that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen is updating.
Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the fitness circles of the performance study of the gestures of the rays and sea horse
The Great Coralrite, the collective in other premises, premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coralrite is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
However, this time, a clearer performance is also being built, which refreshes and crystallizes the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also enough fairytale magic for child participants in the theatre play.
The child's perspective has already been included during the preparation phase of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance but a performance that adults and children work together.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the Great Coral Reef is somewhat similar to fairy tale ballet, fitness circle and nature-related information, but it finally tunes in different, non-human states around visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the orbits of corals and organisms and fish living on coral reef.
Six different fitness circles learn, among other things, the gestures of the rays and seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour is done, where music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both diving people in the large Coral Reef who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are viewed.
There are also organisms looking at corals.
The eyes and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life teeming.
Whether you are a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult.
The group in other spaces strives with their exercises to the limit of thinking and action, where getting caught up when a group is made up of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration is held at Sitrator for endangered corals.
The damage beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to understand the importance of practicing compassion in the face of the prospects of destruction.
In other spaces, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears space.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at all times younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives because of intoxicants and sex because others say they do that.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade over the weekend at the "boyfriend".
When he came to get his drunken sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I could never imagine my own sister in the same situation because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that you should not touch intoxicants and sex is an adult thing.
I hope today's children could live a decent childhood and they would not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see younger girls on Instagram who are makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send revealing images in the evening.
It is even harder to guess what age they are about girls.
The 13-year-olds today can easily look like 18 years old and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am glad there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was able to be a child for many years and didn't have to think about what others think of me.
Yle: Authorities told the state leadership that the case Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Protection Police and the Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but organised crime, Yle reported.
The information on sources of anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (kok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict that there was no speculation that there is anything else here," Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of contact with national security has been found so far about the material seized, but the investigation is just beginning.
There is no way we can know what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewees says.
Extensive searchs that started in the Turku archipelago and the continent a week ago have raised the question of whether the investigation is just about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The evening newspaper compiled a story earlier this week that goes through claims both for and against.
Video: dream goal saved Liverpool's defeat series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly the year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran out for a 1-0 guest win.
At that time, Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to dominate their own field after ending.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a fine league cup guest win on Anfield Road below Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space with the triangle game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted passover.
Hazard drifted a little on the edge of the penal area, but bombed a complete left foot bet in the back corner.
Pool brash Alisson was a little slow in his fight and only got his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned up Mo Salah's control finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Veskari Kepa also got to real action.
The Basque Watch quickly reacted to the Sadio Mané bet and pushed the ball from the root of the ball to corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson resetd Hazard through his throw.
The best place for guests came by the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the Brass Star buffer was directed towards national team buddy David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
It also didn't last for the 89th minute when the changer Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet to the top corner of it.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the league tip - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship battle two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer conversation, the potters are deep
I remember when a few decades ago, a magazine asked different Finnish influencers, which divides the Finnish people.
Juice Wiskinen's answer was the only thing to remember: Nen ending.
Some people's last name have a Nen ending and some don't.
Distribution lines can be created anywhere, and here was one serving.
Finland has achieved that annual clock shift is being abandoned in the EU.
Very many people agree that clock shifting twice a year has been a fool's job and caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest part is now to decide which time to end up: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to say their opinions on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday, October 12.
There is a fierce discussion at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their word to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people's well-being and summer time defend evening light with the influence of people's desire for outdoor activities and, consequently, well-being.
Both have their solid supporters and good arguments.
Studies also show that morning light rhythms a person's day and gives alertness.
On the other hand, if you don't suffer from waking up in the dark, increase the light of people moving outside and gives better opportunities for autumn yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated in class.
I would rather take both, but evilly, for our location in the north of the earth, we can't help anything.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical discussion on the subject is that one's own vision is driven and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the opposing side is not listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's where powder is wasted.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great focus and a mutu feel is enough to justify.
Similar types of issues are usually most brutally and equally fruitless.
It's a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think that's also adapted.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels crisp.
Josba fought a narrow guest win
Josba's first guest game in the floorball Divar produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third batch, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plot a 6-5 winning goal.
When both teams are frozen, crucial minutes were played at the level.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fire-powered anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonenk (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds of series.
Next, O2-Jyväskylä will be visited in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the Church of Grailing a week ago was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded on the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite the municipality and other joints of all the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
Then we move to the parish house to the Karelian banquet table.
The show has all kinds of things throughout the day, both inside and out.
For example, you can explore the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired 37 years as parish master.
The birth festival of the Church also marks the end of one era.
The parish house, already decommissioned, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in the evasive premises at the former municipal house, says Markku Koistinen, a Kappalainen.
The parish house destroyed indoor air problems, but the church has stood healthy for that 200 years.
Elon Musk recedes Tesla's government chairman's position - Fraud charges agreed for $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuits with the SEC, the US Securities Market Surveillance Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being set aside for the company he founded.
Musk, however, is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk has to step down from Tesla's board chairman for three years.
The company is forced to hire an external chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk is also under stricter control.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
Tesla and Musk also pay $20 million (about €17 million) to compromise the case.
"The decision is to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken of the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it demanded that Musk be fined and banned from operating in the management of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went on a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency AFP.
The number of deaths is still believed to increase, as the destruction is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on Sulawes Island.
A warning was given immediately after the quake, which was quickly cancelled.
Authorities say almost all known dead are, at least for the time being, Palda.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, in the Donggala area near the quake centre, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Requests for help from ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers in search of victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction zone today, urged soldiers to continue rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, whose ruins are still believed to have 50-60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said that one person was dug alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, favored by business travelers at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
Syaug said heavy clearing equipment would be needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members still missing, one writer appealed to a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the application's encryption.
The disruptions had access to ministers' phone numbers, among other things.
It was an app used at the British Conservative Party Conference in the government.
For example, Brexit minister Michael Gove, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were subjected to harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the application's encryption deficiency, the audience was able to access the profiles of politicians in the app, which were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The audience was able to access profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily available online.
The profile logged in was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to switch to Boris Johnson's profile photo for a while to insult a porn photo and title.
Michael Goven's profile photo was changed to media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows other people to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login person can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster reviewed.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority ICO is supporting the data leak.
The application was prepared by Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted on security issues.
The Wall Finland quiz has a large number of applauding Poles every week
Precise viewers drew attention to the reactions of The Wall Finland quiz program studio audience.
The Wall, a rapidly spreading US format, landed in Finland in four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high game wall of the format required space.
During the start period, a studio audience of the program was highlighted on social media, which was bet Polish.
Twitter would have a discussion about whether the Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game to play in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of the four domestic programs, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience has close players, other Finnish, foreign Finns living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The public is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes described in the same production space in other countries.
There are such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences that go on the set of different programmes, Sormunen reflects.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green wall-falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters for guest-speaking studios who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneous interpretation for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells you what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on," Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's descriptions in Finland a few years ago.
He always had simultaneous interpretation in the ear and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the set, the sum of Sormunen.
typhoon that sulged southern Japan is moving towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in typhoon Tram, but authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and there is no information on casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so high that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are stagnant due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around six months of Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
Weather scientists say Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces was even darkened
The early part of the Aces has been bad.
The sky was already darkened almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 to Vaasan Sport on Saturday by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and there are two points for six rounds.
No Aces defender or two lower chain players have yet scored a goal.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
The public against Sport was already missing from the hall when almost half of the game remained.
Six games are just played, and there is no reason to give up.
You have to be worried, because that's how weak we played.
Especially the second round performance was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the power of 1+2, told Ässi.
Sport's victory naturally tasted.
The team had a game below on Friday, so it would have thought it would have been visible.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
Bread day visitors continued to increase
Bread Day mother Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience in the big hall.
Somehow you thought that this year might not be so many people, Hyvärinen ponders this morning.
In the autumn of 2017 The Tractorikynnö SM competitions were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already well blocked before 10, sellers reported that the products ended, nearly 500 servings of news porridge were sold, and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard there was a rise.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon could accommodate a lot of program for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record large number of places.
Hyvärinen also estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 journalists, sales of crafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived in the bread keeper.
Bread Day mother PIrkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the hall stands.
At the beginning of the day of bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, the beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemi won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread arrived in the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the rye bread competition spent the day in the martato pie workshop.
7 x most beautiful lamp - from this you recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the interior, and read the book with eyes tirelessly.
It is worth investing in good lighting.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux's Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of lighting increases the more years of age behind.
Adequate light can help with problems that many come with age as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more people are suffering from glare.
Parentingly, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times more light than a twenties.
It is therefore worth investing in the therapeutic effects of the light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The popularity has a japandi style that combines Scandinavianness and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s with strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in the rest of the interior of the home.
Materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more is now being invested in home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The latest trend lamp may not be purchased at home, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain kind of timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold their surface year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
Kokoon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are separated.
The Canadian attacker played three League matches in orange black without power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with an annual contract, which included a probationary period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old attacker played in KHL in the Kunlund Red Star ranks and and at the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycled boxes, plastic changed to paper
The game specialty store Gameman now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone-foot shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed in packaging from importers, for example.
All the packages that come to us will go for reuse.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Pelmies.
As a soft material, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near few days, we are supposed to move to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not a cause extra effort, according to Puuula.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
It also comes with financial savings, for example, when cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is naturally suitable for Gaming Man's activities, as in addition to new products, the company's key product range includes used games and equipment.
Purchase of every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothing works in one outfit season after season like a outfit.
They create a good gardenerob with their versatility, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics of the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes a black polo.
Black knitwear made of natural material with polo collars cannot have a mistake purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight pants, tull skirt and jeans, and around it you can create both a restrained outfit and a snot style.
The polo knit is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create style.
The trend look for autumn is created by golden brown and wide-legged vacosamette pants, black polo knit and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit, along with other classics, blue-green Scots screen skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring a edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casually trendy clothing: jeans skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and stylish!
Russian intelligence services sabotage activities have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents in the West of the Soviet Security Service KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitroh, a archivist who defected to the West of the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers for covert operations for DRG groups.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established inspection stations from the peninsula for roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
Cold War agents hid in the terrain supply kits with mines, explosives, lighters and media for sabotage groups.
In 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, whose trap mine exploded when it was sprayed by authorities with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the province at night
Police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Kontiolahti man blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove two passengers in the early part of Kajaanintie at the beginning of Kajaanintie.
On Polvijärvi Kuorevaarantie, the car derailed to the ditch at 4:00 a night, and a 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1.54 perm, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the exit.
A 20-year-old man in the centre of Outokumpu blew up a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew at 1.33 per mil.
Police suspect these male drivers of gross drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition, of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man carrying a van at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are asking for observations of the stabbing at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in the parking lot off the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on the surveillance camera.
Dark hair suspects dressed in poor pants and brown or beige jacket left immediately after stabbing in the direction of Ratapihankatu bus.
One suspect left Humaliston Street on a bicycle in the direction of downtown.
Pedestrian died after freezing under a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after the bus crashed into him.
The accident occurred after 4:00 a.m. in Rauma, at the point of the meadow.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director at Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in the start, underpower gaming and the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue at the HPK of Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Risk, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Philip has played an important piece for us in the beginnings, underpower gambling and the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player," HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola said in a statement.
According to Toivola, Risk's value will rise when playing ice hockey League solution games.
Riska, a central attacker from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
The winger Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the probationary period.
True story today on TV: Climber left to die twice
Beck Weathers, an American, wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
The night's film is made based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 director tells of a survival struggle that has been handled grainly.
There's been movies and documents about tragedy before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders in the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost vision, which was why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall continued on and never returned.
Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and found no longer back to the camp.
When the man came to look, he was found in such poor condition that survival was not believed.
Weathers were left to die.
However, it was like a miracle he still got on his feet and found the others.
The badly cold Weathers were thought to still die and once again he was left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, the fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers plays Josh Brolin.

Today, 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party began on the church hill of Eno at 10 a.m., after which the offerings of the Karelian banquet table have been available at Eno Parish House.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mountain (pictured) says.
The fire of the Church of Passionate has touched many and was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the church of Eno.
Eno Church is now the oldest in Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran congregations after the destruction of the Church of Kihtelysvaara in the fire.
The Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held in Kihtelysvaara, where the church that was destroyed by fire was silenced and recalled.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed his power in Greece - Sea disappeared and street turned into river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The images taken from the area show a lot of flooding around Greece.
The video released on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region instead of a street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, heavy wind caused strong seagoing.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for monitoring weather information and local authorities' guidelines.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to CNN, a 2011 study found that medicines occur only once or two a year in the world, typically around September and October, while sea temperature is still high.
The storm that is now blowing left behind flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been caused by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The storm is also under the areas destroyed by wildfires in the summer around Athens.
A medican was also raging in Greece last November.
You shouldn't go to the sea now, still flights on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on vacation on the Greek islands threatened by autumn storm
Tours to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, it is worth being careful not to fly on the storm of branches or other bulk.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to just over 3,500 Finns in Greece on vacation through the Sun Travel weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even the storm Zorbas, which is rising up in terror, has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in gusts up to 45 metres per second.
The greenness of the weather is enhanced by heavy rains.
All those who have travelled to Greece through Solar Travel and Tui from Finland who have reported their phone number have been warned of hard winds via SMS, according to tour operators.
Still solar and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, solar travel communications expert on Saturday, the worst has avoided the worst in the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Safety above.
Antonia Schroderus, a media operator, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still peaceful, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
The aid currently has a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers in the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island will reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had mocked the sun and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, the Ikonen of the Solar Trips said.
Zorbas is estimated to move to Turkey's next nuisance, albeit slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, for example, and have checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya Tui, for example," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvisen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening dresses in the Miss Final - this is how they react to the situation
Janni Hussi, a media person and fitness beauty, arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in a open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirly Karvine.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and were laughing at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanom that he was in a hurry in preparation, and he had to put himself on a plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the Miss Final, and he talks to the front-line stars arriving.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi on Friday to Jätkäsaari
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in a hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnered the curious looks of pensioners
The host and Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen of 2016 told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet she had enough to do with radio lines and Love Island Finland shoots.
There has been enough rush even to the point that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I makeup and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
The evening dress exchange at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen says he pulled out his makeup in the middle of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amused at least for others.
Karvinen flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she enjoyed her job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience being stopped so far.
Karvinen says she said she said hello to the singles of the show on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How do I wear high-generation boots?
Three Perfect Example Costumes
Classic clothing is clothing that work in a outfit after season like a outfit.
Often, classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the overgeneration boots that have become hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not left anywhere.
As its name suggests, the boots that reach the knee are repeated in stylish year and season after year.
Showing boots share user opinions, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
Overgeneration boots are actually suitable for any kind of outfits.
Whether it's pharchus, lace, tunic or trico, the simple leather or fake leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in both party looks and everyday outfits.
Black top-generation boots are well suited for even gentle outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, flowered piseer skirt and a gentle, plush knit.
Fresh but autumn elegant everyday outfit for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created by a long copper-brown velvet machine, overgeneration boots, spectacular earrings and a staple little bag.
Although the top-generation boots have a certain sophistication, they also fit perfectly into a relaxed everyday mouth together with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and still so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic by robot bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment shows how robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, Transport Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always responsible for an auxiliary passenger sitting on board.
Vehicles sense their environment all the time with several different sensors and assess whether the roadway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the observed barrier is a vehicle, bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, Wednesdays from 10-15 am to 3 pm and Thursdays from 10 am to 3 pm.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick passengers up.
Robot car stops are identified by stop markings.
The most secure can be reached from the stop in Otakaare, number 1.

Police oversee hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the road contact persons of the police department reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
A hunting card was checked for each hunter and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, hunting weapons holding permits were checked and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used for chicken fortressing.
Police said 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found in connection with the supervision who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 daily fines for unauthorized fishing.
Police also blew 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fine proceedings, police times.
In conclusion, hunters follow the licensing of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by control.
One hunter stated that "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone has checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting control in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (doc.) will travel to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly need for refugee camps, such as single-parent families, people with disabilities and the sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with NGOs operating on the border between Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has supported the quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500 to 2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit is the first during this government period to be made by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Ministers Petteri Orpo (doc.) and Paula Risikko (doc.) were able to move to their new duties before the visits were held.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the hacks - you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore.
Karjalainen reported on a bill last Saturday to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, in principle, prohibits the holding of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministries' regulations in the form of production animals, pets or otherwise business.
Therefore, everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals mentioned separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, it will mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law separately prohibits action that endangers the security or good practice of society.
Now, in principle, a ban on any activity that is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
The change causes nothing new to try out in business, for example, and nothing else is done until the law or regulation that accepts it has been passed.
The government's activities in the drafting of law in general have been weak.
If we are now on the road that everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act will require an update.
But a law project along this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it accepts such a 'everything is forbidden, which is not specifically allowed by law or regulation'.
Hopefully there is a reasonable minister to suspend the progress of such a legislative project.

Turkey urges to download mobile phones for storm
Storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country from the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities urged citizens from the early evening to download their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functionality of the internet connection so that people can get current situation updates, reports local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from the windows, as well as move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Turkey is expected to have heavy rain and wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
In Greece, red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the areas of South Greece Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising Greek trips warned Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also published a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A while ago, when I contacted me, there the wind rained and rained.
The people were calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen of the Tui travel agency told the STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not received messages from Finns in need.
In Greece, ships did not operate on Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told the travel agencies to the STT.

Finnair was reported on Saturday that the weather situation will be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority compared to Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece in the time of the Russian GP.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel said.
Ferrari was already difficult in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkös was asked what the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go the same speed as them.
I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always guessing, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
Time times saw a rare delicacy for Sauber in the future stable of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, replacing Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the last time-time session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth starting place is the best in over three years.
And while in the second driving session, as many as five drivers left completely undrived, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging to Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early season, the step forward has been big.
Next year there's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart night advanced on steady terms.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he couldn't get a decent hit.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the match with his tough series that found it well.
The Finnish was also in a clearly better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left right.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In a ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he changed to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius' career.
There might be a chance to even get into a World Cup match," Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's come to mind.
This will not be any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Number of victims of Indonesia disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president urges us to prepare for a clear rise in the sacrificial number.
The country's vice president Jusuf Kalla said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the most affected areas on Sulawes Island: the port city of Palu and its neighboring Donggala.
So far, all victims are Palda, there is no clarity about Donggala's situation yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel named Roa Roa has collapsed in Palu.
Rescuers say they heard the cries of people trapped from the ruins, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearing work.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are broken in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh remaska
Billnäs Ruukki is currently being elected a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, every Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of a glass bowl on stage.
In particular, the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitant answer brought about sweet but benevolent laughs in the audience present.
The question asked Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book is read by the Miss Finalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he began with hesitation.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is..., Anttikoski said thinking.
The thought break made a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued his response:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I have read is someone in economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a skewed applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
In the past, Anttikoski attracted attention, as he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm is abandoned.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue as it goes
This recipe is for you with good, acidic apples from their own back, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, even though a lot of people already grow that pear tree.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake also rains its pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed homes.
Slice.
You can melt in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the foam corn flour as well as melt butter.
Combine corn starch, or maizena and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, scatter 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the fjord and apply pear slices on sugar.
Spoon half the dough on pear slices and apple lobes on top of the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough on apple lobes.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let cool in the fjord and then undo the serving dish.
Cut the cake only properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and crumbs easily because there are almond and corn flour in the dough with no gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January

Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admiration?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two species of "cooly" of slightly different features: generally attractive coolness and the opposite dissident-coolity.
Charmingly cool people, according to the description of the researchers, had many features considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and ignored the reviews of outsiders.
Both types were combined by good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of the hard time is not cool: high status in a teenager may not lead to success later in life.
This is what a 2014 US study published in Child Development says.
Young people who dated early partyed, sought out good-looking groups, and sought the popularity of others, had an increased risk of using substance abuses and drifting into crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less than their most discreet peers at the time.
High status-based luk skis, brand bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more prepared to befriend a regular market shirt than those dressed in a sign shirt - despite the fact that most people chose a sign shirt in the situation of getting acquainted.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a hurricane hit by a weather warning screaming red.
During the weekend, it can rain as much water in southern Greece as in Finland on average six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will strike Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the ambassador, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
It says the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland early in the week, blew well over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimeters of water can come in southern Greece this weekend.
It is equivalent to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.

Valtteri Bottas shook and bursting adrenaline in Sochi, will he be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more minutes after his Russian GP pole position run when he was in front of the media.
A fine round left Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton behind Mercedes and was certainly important to the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of a round of decisions.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little, Bottas figured it out.
I have only been on a stake once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so time has passed pretty much.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to skip on the Sochi track, so the departure plays a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas was allowed to answer curious if he was driving for victory tomorrow or whether there's a jeessing Hamilton approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There may be no other goal when you leave the stake, Bottas piled.
But as a stable, we fight for both masters.
Lewis' leadership to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep it in mind.
Let's see what happens, Bottas completed.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas' success after the drive, and even seen at Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff tasted.
Lewis had an intention of winning Valtteri, but he failed in the seven-mouth.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything about himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline was bursting out of the ears, Wolff said.
The question of whether the stable Bottas and Hamilton are driving uprightly," Wolff replied dodging.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race leaves.
Kristeelainen Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars ended rarely.
Hardly never before have the brothers ended up being Finnish masters at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally in Turku and Salo, Tusuri and Henrik Pietarinen, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kiteelainen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him the Finnish Championship from the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, competing at Honda Civic, and map reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku race with the temper because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give a handicap when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
It was a pretty blind time to put a third clip.
In a situation like that, it's not appropriate to be lost.
On Saturday, Jussi Tepo was only the second speed in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on United States, France and Turkey to withdraw its troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops in Syria are fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over."
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to seven years of war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in Germany that a Syria meeting was planned for October, which would be attended by the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people at the screens.
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge in the United States received at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump and California professor Blasey Ford, accused of harassing him, were before the Senate Legal Committee telling their story.
Preliminary results show that the hearings were followed by six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, several more online consultation followed.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported setting its record for the year at 8.2 million live broadcasts.
CNN's figure rises by over 10 million, including those following the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewer figures come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are dizzy anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million ratings in the United States are usually accessible to sports matches, as well as the great Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as presidential speeches and in 2016 also presidential debates.
Of course, the most watched program in the United States, the American Football League NFL final match to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was viewed by nearly 48 million people and an inauguration of over 30 million people, according to Nielsen.
A top important thing
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely significant case in the United States, as posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was a so-called scale language on several questions, whose voice could resolve the position of a nine-person court.
She was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minorities and, for example, decided in 2015 with a voice that same-sex were granted marriage rights throughout the federal government.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his heels.
His choice for the Supreme Court may lock justice in conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to be informed of parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, the Kanta service situation was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was made for those under 10 years old in autumn 2016.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing long time to repair.
Now the repair is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a through-call thing.
After that, the understanding of the layman is about the touch of a button: now that the wire is closed, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents if he has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is paid, and the 10-year-old doesn't even get bank IDs.
In practice, no one can see the information of the four graders in primary school except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much about parental right as the right of children.
It is extremely important for child care that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations where not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, from which free care is a deeply relevant human rights.
In the United States, FBI begins beating harassment allegations about Kavanaugh
American media say the FBI is investigating harassment allegations made by at least two women.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The report must not last longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a report that is more limited than criminal investigation and may not become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to shake the chamber as well.
Police say they put a man in a police prison "soil".
Police were threatened by the suspect's abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The official reports an incident that originated when a man over 30-vutias violently challenged a dispute at the downtown restaurant.
He first assaulted another client within the nutrition movement.
This resulted in removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party ran in, the man still hit him.
The triple abuse led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect still behaved aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
Police say they sent a man to a police prison to "soil".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid organizations prepare to start work at Sulawes, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The UN Children's Organization (Unicef) and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, Finland's UNICEF Information Manager.
Local authorities are leading rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capacity, Haru says.
The first task is now to find people in the ruins, both survivors and the dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala region, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, Haru says.
Buildings are often lightweight in Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once survivors have been found, they need protection - first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are most often able to offer water purification tablets that UNICEF has in stock as well.
Water systems are being repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported at first, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN, among other things.
In the initial phase, funds previously collected are used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started raising money to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends Tesla as chairman of government - $20 million fines for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars companies, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk will end his position as chairman of the board of electric car company Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk waives the task as part of the agreement he entered into with the U.S. Securities Market Surveillance Authority.
By agreeing Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk for securities fraud due to tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which brought the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to chair Tesla's board for three years.
Tesla must also appoint a new "independent member" to its government and take two "independent leaders" in its management team.
Tesla must also establish a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fines, Tesla also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billion's tweets say the company would have been purchased off the stock exchange at $420 share price.
Tesla's stock price rose by more than ten percent in a day after tweets, but later declined.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
The supervisor said he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal of the stock exchange with another management team or the company's Board of Directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 percent when the SEC reported a fraud charge.
The agreement for the news is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last sentence is not the reason
The cathedral clocks do not naturally ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical fault.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise point at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: while the church crypt would include exorcism and the organ would ring on their own.
This is not the case, but the clock has stopped because of the technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by the repairman, but some part has broken and a new part is expected," says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki.
The account states that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock stop.
Jamsen says that church bells do not ring because of a fault.
