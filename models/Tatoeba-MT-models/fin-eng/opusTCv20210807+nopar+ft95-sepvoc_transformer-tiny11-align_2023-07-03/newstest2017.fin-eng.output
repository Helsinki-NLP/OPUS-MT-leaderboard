28-year-old chef found dead in shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and states, "His business finally went well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galician Frank Galicia, San Francisco's coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was identified as a homicide and that the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as a bus chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "horrible and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and they will be missed very much," the spokesman said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said Frank stayed at the top of the house, but that recently "his business finally went well."
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling together with the family was to make us food, make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of disputes.
He was the brother who drifted with the stream.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to accept new industrial action in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking the entire Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns regarding the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and medical students voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter published via Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "selfishly quiet" about issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the fully proposed new agreement and demand formal renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to empower the gradual and expanding industrial action programme that begins early September.
The dispute has resulted in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The director of BMA's medical trainees, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had negotiated the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the contract was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external consortium?
The gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands on each other and to declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greets his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more reconciliation.
Yes, the event was handed.
But Putin's smile seemed forced, and he didn't pose much heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I went crazy.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to the better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the general public in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led to an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the allegations of high officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled Syrian territories.
He has denied this emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing on the harsh truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed in last month's failed coup.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
For Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They're hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report formulated.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West of what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding to the long-standing resentment snail's rapid EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly received loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a clearing for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the flashy seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to be presented by the "external consortium" as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel the West abandoned them and mistreated them, joining forces.
However, these two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be much to say that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has given up these goals.
The Bank's strategs have been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nationsrugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, except the headquarters and stock exchange listings, will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in a customer and staff tour in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The CBS brand will be an employer of our investor brand and employees because we are now becoming a brand bank much more."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move in the direction of a brand bank because basically (we're asking) about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank to customers and offering these brands.
But with the work we have done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Prediction and reaches 3,000 wins
The dettori sprays champagne after a double win he has a total of 3,000 wins
The race rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone with his second victory in his home track while competing with John Gosden's predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who previously won Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It is not a big event, this is not Royal Ascot, but a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilection to the front after the victory.
Two race riders have achieved this milestone in obstacle competitions - master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in their record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the present era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical mood separates him from others in the weighing room.
She is a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans to the sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that he would have rided 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of the weekend and big games!
Seriously, Frankie has ridd winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but besides that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated a milestone with a drone that formed as his trademark with a saddle.
From flying endings to dronely landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race ride for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
He piles of victories in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane accident and suffered a ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he initially had a difficult time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed significant character in challenging the skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired the Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said Putin has "appointed Ivanov to move away from the head of the Russian presidential administration," but he was given no reason.
Ivanov's assistant director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the Estonian capital in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that Persecute be appointed to replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, such as Putin, was active in the Soviet security service KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real doubt.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that early 2012 I asked you to give my responsibility for four years of this very complex, you could even say a laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the position in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the leader of the State Security Service FSB, who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the series' set in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and strife at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from a series about the FBI Agents team is expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred with the Dharma & Greg situation comedy has been involved in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it everything I can for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved to the end, but that's not possible right now.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the series can have.
The beginning of the twelfth season of the series is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a vortex.
Bain, which lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
£1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry's overpass as well as the ground bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "covers" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 gauze ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building Queensferry's overpass.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finalizing the shutter between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where extreme precise dimensions must fit together.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge cover is now in place and the last part of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire lid is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding northern column road cover, we then had to close the remaining proportion from the north, i.e. inland.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway land bridge 700 millimeters in the south direction.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the ground bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at a slope angle of about 3%.
Demanding, because the permitted dimensional deviations that the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy while alive"
Three men are "lucky while alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station set an alarm at 1:20 a.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on their own.
"We saw the boat going closer to the men and imagined the worst," Vince Jones, the helm of Moelfre's lifeboat, said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, 60-year-old, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a killing switch rope, but it had somehow detached from the person who drove the boat when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been worried that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and participate in some activities.
The display time was originally limited to television, then video games and now recently to smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring to a fad called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they created a series of drawings, playing cards and other downstream products).
Like many phenomena in pop culture, its popularity had somewhat diluted before this new game was released in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
How does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked with GPS, and which can be "photon" (with a phone screenshot) or "request".
The generation who played the game when he was younger has joined the fad and jumped up on the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a remarkable addition to the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in users followed by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees training level information.
The calls of many public health campaigns to "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any result because most public health warnings are boring and are transmitted by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are at lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse for listing here.
The fineness of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This is how to cover the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving hookers are looking for things to complain about this.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although there were applications like Fitbit in the past that could track activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The novelty disappears and the use will subside in due course.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that connect apps and virtual reality to real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gymnastics multimatch
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity noise.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth with boom.
Incredible permanna.
Great everywhere.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
He's overall point, on February 6,98, were clearly better than silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles in the United States balance boom at the women's rack gymnastics' multi-match individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to have successively won the multi-match championship, and the fifth American champion overall, while strengthening her reputation as her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement takes him to the same class as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their species to a new level:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Cup medals, including 10 gold, programs whose blend of ambition and accuracy has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I saw."
The last test awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Returning the family home to Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals, would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles in the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the multi-match of women's rack gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination at the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went a long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes his trademark's volt control - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the hall where Boorman coached, has become a force factor.
He hasn't lost in a multiplayer game since summer 2013, and this winning streak will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is the dominant world champion, waited.
He rose to the top with boom points 15.433 and crossed them with a 15,933 permanna.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they were waiting for the end points - a mere formality - and tears rose into Biles' glittered, white, and blue-limited eyes when the dream he once wrote in his clipbook became true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of repulsion four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, who Americans call "grandmother", was clearly in charge.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanto performance, an emotional return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the widespread tweet of this 19-year-old from the past this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in Phoenix's first serial killer incident in the last decade were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on June 12.
The statement reports that the shooter standing on the passenger side of the car launched up to eight times and then escaped on another vehicle.
Police said the triple killing did not seem to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or $2,900 on another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting caused the investigators to see if it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in the past four months, conducted in two mainly Latin American districts.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of a home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police bulletin of shooting only half an hour before the triple killing, targeting an empty convertible, believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shells, bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "The situation gets easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course her mother.
But, unlike much of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know while pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walking rack.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth shows you how the signposts invented by Edmund sign "should you go to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a regular sign language - he says Edmund has come up with some of his own signposts.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of reasons: genetics, such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load caused by the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction in a long time because I don't expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hope-rich advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe that things will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, waiting for more rain on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana, as well as southern Mississippi, flooded over their crusts and caused a widespread flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Services Office, said they would receive requests for high tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The floodkeeper is valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that another three to five cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the floodkeeper was in effect on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood summit record over the weekend.
Alek Krautmann, a weather forecast, said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of Ascension County below along the river as flooded rivers slowly fall into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, was at the highest level ever at Friday morning at 9 p.m.
Rescuers are still picking people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were on Friday near Gloster among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another stepfather who lives near him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It extended all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years he has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have all injuries, and that he is the only swimming skill.
Hansford said the rescue workers saved the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods "spread rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country was fully saturated with heavy rain that continued since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the rescue of the residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county president, Robby Miller, said that officials saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tide.
Covers have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said the steady rain continued off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, Director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
Mahaj Brown, six-year-old, who was "full of bullets", survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means shooting another six-year-old in town this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, hand, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition is recorded as critical and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men were reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems there was a cross fire between several shooters.
Fire-type shell casings that come from various attack weapons filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active battle," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also received hits.
No arrests have been made and, according to the information received, police are investigating the tapes on the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by a Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, all are proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established the involvement of black and Latin American women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised the Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but master gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to have successively won individual gold in the women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnastics halls across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts in the gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice in private gymnastics clubs, maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnastics, as well as families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhood areas that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and available gymnastic training to communities where numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latinos) and we have coached national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girlpower" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctoral trainees organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff, but 58% of 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was on "unknown soil", and that even small additional delays damage staff and patients.
The first medical trainees are transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to nightly and weekend working methods to improve treatment over difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee of Medical Practitioners, said in a statement last night: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially to accelerate the existing labour crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When the time before the first group of doctors is transferred to the new agreement, there are only eight weeks left, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced reluctance from the government side to participate and occasionally deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he doesn't, medical interns are ready to continue industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors on strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with staff members of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners so they wouldn't go on strike.
Mortimer said, "The labor battles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, as well as cause concern, anxiety and disruption to patients, care providers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, positively responded to their concerns regarding the role of supervision (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical leave, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how seriously employers, the Health Education England education organisation and the Ministry of Health are respecting agreements with November, February and May BMA.
A drug paying two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a drug that pays two pounds a day after authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulation drug, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is given for as early as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people receive a heart attack in England each year, and a quarter of these cause another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat accumulated in the artery wall, which forms cramps.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood circulation into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes off, it can pass with the blood and cut the blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clotting less likely.
The NICE guideline draft published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg taken with aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression-preventing treatments, up to a quarter of people who have a heart attack later receive another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of renewal can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor, along with aspirin, is effective in lowering the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we provisionally recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add available treatment options to many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the effectiveness and safety of ticagrelor - in particular as regards the risk of bleeding - over three years are limited, treatment is not recommended in the draft guidance for longer than this period.
Culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, being revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles radiates police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
The former Community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter must only say his name and address.
The report even suggests that an indestructible ink be put on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working group.
"This would not only protect against election fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets voting scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal actions.
The court found Rahman "cytfully distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced its critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was a religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of the person's vote, appearing as something else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence in fraud all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern in voting for election fraud by post, in which high-ranking Muslim community members were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
He said in his report: "The evidence presented that vulnerable members of communities of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists to deal with ballots by mail to stop "collection of votes".
The report, which Theresa May is looking at, also calls for more severe revisions for registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
View options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use an indestructible ink to the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made votes and envelopes through mail where votes are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling sites.
Require that only English be used at polling sites (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric tapes the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The Court remained as a result of a number of corruption and illegal actions by Lutfur Rahman and his official," he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized the ineffective "tuck box checks" at city council voting registration agencies.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a revival.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as a source of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud, as well as the denial of the facts of certain groups, threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Kate's cyclist twin and other celebrity-expressed photos at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone confused from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer who can boast with his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellisonia, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures rose to the surface, where he looks frighteningly like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the bigo of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a big resemblance, except maybe about the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London from 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina's greatest, expressive eyes have been said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh, has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Bigger gear to the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more of the same thing as actor Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and light hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team reminds the "Soseph Gordon Levitti's athletic version."
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarity
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter actress do indeed have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gymnast Gabby Douglas, who won the gold medal, whose own beautiful broad smile matches the smile of the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator makes an apology after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4x200-metre freestyle message enraged on Wednesday by CBC's live Olympic broadcast viewers.
Canadian television company CBC must have apologized after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-metre freestyle signal.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's commentator team to bring "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China was screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message at the second share of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did CBC's commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the 4 x 200-metre message final of women's free swimming as follows: "That little 14-year-old China blunder, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was tough and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #I hateful."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC's broadcast, apologized MacDonald's comment on live, saying, "We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was sent.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we regret that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times from people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russel, a commentator, had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and signed an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media live.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said at the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I made a swimmer to perform, not him as a person."
"It's enough to say I didn't mean it disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client dismayed by a woman who brazenly matched underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
What was not improved by the fact that after assessing what she looked like in his pants, she peeled them off and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually arranged four pairs of underwear in a store located at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's movement at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where she matched underwear and then put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children at the same time, said that after trying underwear, a mysterious woman "dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a couple of underwear on display, took off her own tights and underwear, and put the things to fit her leg.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for atonement, he just stood there shameless."
"Everyone stared while he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because they put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three couples before finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care about who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he matched."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent city, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but have not been cleaned."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I found that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing items from the sale after the woman left, which is just good."
"It would be awful to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and stripped them away and they have not been washed."
A spokesman for Primark said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All products in question have been removed from the sale."
This allows you to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to the Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with robbers waving the gun at close distance.
Whether approached from front or back, this video shows you how you can pay the attacker in the same measure.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from the back, the first thing to do is turn to see your attacker and "clean the line of fire."
You then catch a gun between the forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in your face with your free elbow.
Continue by hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes out of pain to the tip, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face and back, keeping the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot trigger.
At the same time put weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point him with a gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video for exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga Grand Master, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for travel guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of the most dirty and nightless places in Europe.
A host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51 from Suffolk, licked euro banknotes, railing Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet rinse button, and Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, an experiment that was made into a film called Internal Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train flush button used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright was constantly talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him anything else in the mouth of a bad taste.
Wright became a well-known tester for endurance in his gut as he travels around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task, which extends from public rail stations to the toilet seat flush button, indeed tested his immune system.
In the film made, he said, "Since childhood, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth since soil, worms and curly water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of over 4,000 units in the photometer.
By comparison, the reading of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer's result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a tourist film, on the trail of Internal Power, along with Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting here.
On the trail of inner power, the Finnish dairy, Valio, was produced together.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said, "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up in the idea of 'calling Ian'."
They claim that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health, and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell more about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added, "Let's say it now: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, like the nighting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things that licked were easier for Ian, while some were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows stored."
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least sometimes use products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria.
The dormitor family destroyed a renthouse in Cornwall Saltash, before eviction
The dormitor family caused £50,000 damage to their rental house after they were evicted due to the terroristization of neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash since they had been elected numerous times.
After being heavily removed from the property, shocked housing company staff said the property was in poor condition.
There were gaping gaps in the walls, the floorboards had been torn, waste had been applied to the floor, and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, a host of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the property cannot be repaired.
He said, "This has been a nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of points to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through Cornwall's less comfortable groups.
This family is deputed, and their names are deputed."
The couple had three sons who lived in the property sometimes, and police said the family's tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, named in the lease, received a decision on antisocial behavior in June.
Many of the rooms in the house under the demolition threat found old waste.
The property, from which drugs have been previously transmitted, the floorboards had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing greatly evicted the woman and her partner's property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often invited to the property
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the wild wall of the renthouse.
He added, "It's a shame that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, for the eviction is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, and brave community members who gave us information.
I hope this development will bring some comfort to the neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom
Housing company employees now have to clean up the waste surfaces surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis and scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty of holding a class b drug as an intention to distribute it forward.
He claimed that the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless after now staying in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house rooms had been snorted graffiti.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who will continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew a beach-catching low
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock in their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept by really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
It was at the moment that terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flyed jet swept over a full beach.
Dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft came almost at touch distance from sun worshipers on a sand strip in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the shower machine, even though they didn't see what was coming from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who released videos of dramatic passing on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
The terrain has destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that affected visibility, smoke caused by wildfires and thick fog,
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half of the year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result than planned in January - June.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, exote is trying to shorten the sequences of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously generated by surplus.
The proportion left over it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borders Faulted in Immola Military Power
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military jury of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Borders Course Valuation was held on the garrison sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special border hockey is trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border ice cream.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special limiters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the oath involved five veterans of the wartime border forces.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A drawing of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible on the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The officers are Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costumes.
The unit has shown its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the police would not leave the whistles until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit in each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police, leads operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas shared by police institutions, and their mission is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own area
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to use registers, alarm mission database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the author makes up a certain image.
Preparations can be done either on the basis of the method of action or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit employees do not go through the city with collars, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both our own and criminals are not reported, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thus seeking to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police will publicly tell you about the methods if it anticipates them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, the method of marking empty dwellings used in housing breaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, knob needle, or tape piece on the front door of the apartment, with which they tried whether the residents were really out of town.
Pre-trial investigation material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the District Court minutes, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves in their hands.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in the number of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new course of action were taken as early as 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended until the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
ISIS schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Cadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join ISIS, has been rumored to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard her dead in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just while planning to escape a war-torn country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others that there are real risks to going into the war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate majority, says the next president will elect the person to replace Antonin Scalia, a member of the late Supreme Court.
Reid said Thursday in a telephone conference that he predicts "with some certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "wind the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland's appointment are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "cashmen" and "positors."
He said Trump was not suitable for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top generation of models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start presenting timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release, where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you rush to fulfill the comment section with irritable insults written by the nickname EiAllSoneCentral Men, note that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken new coming of the plates is not because more and more born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but the longing of the middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, the most likely to buy records are among the 18-24 age group.
It is also not just a question of collecting enthusiasts, but includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to hold their feelings (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would be busy before I stopped, I would form a cup out of my hands and say something authoritative, such as, "Let's look at it more closely."
Let's look into it more closely.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supplies now fill buildings with independent stores in the past - a handful of stunning specialized record stores remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to evaluate their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and touring shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge number of records and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can repurchase those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that disk buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and add, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the records have come back to fashion and have become a need to buy their old records back.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have gotten rid of their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl peas of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to trust the permanence of familiar sheet covers; objects that evoke memories of teens' lucky days.
"I think sometimes it could be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We are like their social workers!" another employee said suddenly from the record stack.
An April opinion poll conducted by the ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of people who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would likely look seriously concerned when I was browsing the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "winning" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not parents, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fop, where there is an almost entire floor reserved for vinyls today, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned movements - speakers of the freshest Wild Beast's latest synth and sex-filled pop, and not improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching the various records on sale.
He's making window shopping, not spending much money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so record collection is not really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm studying jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before Dad and daughter were thinking about buying Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered in the albums of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyls".
But given that even the small attention these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths to get more, there is not much to complain about here.
It comes no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one who spends the most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores, and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings flying around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television host as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspected middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holker has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female whose age is believed to be between 272 and 512 years and is five meters long.
French court rejects application to land trade in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected Calais authorities' application to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary trades, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pences), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the seats should be dismantled because they represent a non-paid parallel economy and because they are a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals offered by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
Court Lille ordered that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people running temporary trade, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people living in extreme precarious conditions.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the demolition threat was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe at the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals daily, English and French hours, and asylum advisors to hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - top reading - after the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food is falling sharply in Finland to the pleasure of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen the most in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
In the UK, only in the UK, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place of low-cost food, although the price of food has fallen extensively.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from similar countries.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the average of the EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes at VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
Those returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide that all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells us the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, schools start practicing coding.
Swedish education begins in sixth grade at the latest, and social doctrine is already being read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It used to think that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how they try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507 years old.
Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, followings only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined adult ice sharks from 28 females left in fishermen's gears.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon timing of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cent amazone fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 sellers will not be reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockmann, a department store company.
The companies in trouble ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction of about 300 jobs, the majority of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It says that the number of sellers in department stores is not reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 support employees are offered new work as a seller.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of them, the need for reduction was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction in the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realised during next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of €50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Stockmann's vt. CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not achieved the goals set by the company.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex in particular.
The chain achieved its best second quarter net sales and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales will decline from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but further south is pout.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, we stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as an athlete for the national team in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leadership, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials turned in to Anzrah's authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home, as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino said to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at the time.
It is not yet known whether there are consequences for the runner as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is in advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was only running with an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where is everyone?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow athletics.
A struggle for athletic medals began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day morning games and 65 percent of the tickets at the evening games have been sold.
The other was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulking out of the cheering people.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The disappearance of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have seen thousands of empty benches in rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stands was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only 30 percent of the 12,000-person stands were full.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
Even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
Competition organizers spokesman Mario Andrada said this weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium was enough empty places in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball Copacaba sand has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
People in the galleries were enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and communities can redeem rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire the right of holder for payment.
The holder receives a veto for its 187 square square meter block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Obtaining a court of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go to carry banners or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of control for his company, explains.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information in their block, which allows, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website shows the name information of those who acquired the holder rights on the same map where the block information on the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act somehow unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they are allowed to be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It mainly funds its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the worst of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are most tormenting Turku from the large cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and parts of them per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities this year's January to August.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, they took place four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, double theft occurs relative to the population compared to others," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of theft can be influenced by how much you move in the city on wheels and how much wheels there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu Ähäs.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike theft goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a different type of city where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and about 4,000 bikes per year in Helsinki alone.
"They're in large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime about bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are reported.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases in connection with another investigation, when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in a drug case in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the work itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, for example, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen as in previous years Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term own use, for example, but a large number of stolen wheels end up on sale, for example, via the web.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not come to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad much," Reen says.
Buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns, according to police.
Some must buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful, as he may commit a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if the wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa for the duration of his working day to the Kallio Library's shelters in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, the Moose says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk so far."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be hipster value here," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stuttered the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in some fixed, such as a bike rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose hull alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from friends that the bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such snot-Jos."
A bike was stolen from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, so Valve knew how to wait for it to be usurped.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer crews from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to those under 15 years of age who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"Everything is guided by the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that not everything would be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel but reflect on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer of Palmu, which followed the experiment, Iikka Lovio, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of those under 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you're choosing on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
The paper said the open letter was aimed at Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party money to be directed to the congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence, and record disfavor, threaten to bring a sound avalanche to Democrats in this election," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to the congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti- Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Politico said Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not to support anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy would go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly through private money.
The building program is a handhold for American due jobs who suffer after factories moved to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it's gonna have to pay the withholding tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As president] I am opposed to any trade agreements that work against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program released by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed sharp discount on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making the products himself in America," Clinton said.
Such are Rio ratings: The races have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of viewers so far.
At once, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Championships in Athletics a month ago received nearly 800,000 viewers at a time for TV2, and the European Football Championships are well over one million.
So far, the most interesting of the Olympic sports have been the cycling of Sunday night and the rack gymnastics that both reached nearly half a million spectators for the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that viewers are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports race to which Yle has owned an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio race broadcasts will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lame interest - if it is now considered lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the initial races, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other species interested in Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't have the ratings on the web until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired by all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the defects have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with a delay and other small technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are visible in Yle's canals and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech conveys races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Risinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving trainer Matti Kannela found a print of about 20 square metres in Ristiselta, with a dive computer looking 104 metres to depth.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Looking at this way, Päijänne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction of August 12 at 2:29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax sale: Taxation of pensioners is still more intense
The taxation of pensioners remains more intense than wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came up under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think that should definitely be in it.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners had income reductions that eased taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in Parliament who grilled the then finance minister Alexander Stubb (c.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
In the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (doc.), tax cuts are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo for the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been reached with effort.
He says that holding on to the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government term.
It is done by labour market organisations, so it should not be shaken by questioning.
It comes to need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith for the future.
Prolonging unemployment in a fight
The Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in a budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties in Thailand attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to pursue Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact people at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there's no record of the attacker yet.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and a referendum on the constitution drawn up by a military junta last week.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, in turn, an ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population is smold, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, in the past, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thailand police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, Thai police say, according to the AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours, after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination favored by Finns, four bombs exploded in the holiday island Phuket at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current reports say they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the magazine.
A total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani in southern Thailand and the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is through the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Ch, head of the military junta that controls Thailand, said the attacker is not yet known so far.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions for caution, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the Finnish night and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where she believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack that exploded about every half hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-match
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second score of 60,098 and Alija Mustafina of Russia was the third with a 58,665 point performance.
Biles, 18, is still seeking rack championships at the Rio Games with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics in terms of the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permanno championships three times in a row as well as the boom last and the year before.
For the US team, Biles has achieved two world championships of the team competition.
The fainter World Cup medals in Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isk has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will result in anything more wonderful, Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies that hit Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, then hardly this either.
Huovila's company office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual this morning.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the attacks.
At 7:30 a day in Thailand's time at Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol observed two men suitable for description hidden in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of operating theft, theft and aggravated damage of the motor vehicle.
Police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russian Leader Changes: Clear Moving Out
Russia made a high-ranking leader change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the cause of Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from building up power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been chained with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, is moving to special environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the amendment to a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Perino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old curves, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Outer Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as a human race to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human race to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbiji, which is important to ISIS last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Fixed the previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, the ISIS fighters actually kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run under the prestigious games against time.
He injured his butts in the early part of the season and was forced to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a complete preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's a key issue," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Pori Bolt, the star of Jamaica has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres in the time of 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and competitors' confidence in the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
The world records in Berlin by 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 at two hundred are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes that it is born but Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger of Bolt is Athens' 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth-seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in the finals of the Games if he has made it.
In Daegu, the 100 World Cup final was left by Bolt not running due to fraud.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympic Games that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals about Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping crime.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Appeals for Sport.
Xinhua says that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in Xiny on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent a athletic coach home from Rio due to doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee IOC said Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
Media reports say it's Kenyan express coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
There's nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in a 200-meter season of his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed season before Wang Shun, China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read this week on Iltalehti's website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed if there is a little noise in social media or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough revealingness - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no rear steps.
It's important to look good, and little bits are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to scare and perhaps startled, but he emphasizes that he does not want to play the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus must be in athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelto grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from (the host) dress.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police filed two arrests due to suspicion of terror
Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people due to suspicion of terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety supervision of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, the members of which were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages that call for violence had been spread in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police detonated suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-section match in the empty hall of the Rio Basketball Tournament on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
Police let the public in after controllingly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the beginning of the match, because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only then let the public into the hall.
The pot woke up the Spanish team that started the race.
Spain, who started the two losses, won Nigeria points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police already completed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling goal site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-final game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentina's dam dressed Petäjä-Siren - Finnish ponders protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren was experiencing a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine dam dressed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening departure of the women's surfing day.
Winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck due to the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn stayed in place 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
In terms of the tip, the crash was not much affected.
Friday is an important day to race the 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Special Things That According to Science Extend Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirect affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that can't be affected by a person themselves can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to spend... just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to determine the secret of long age with a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented the seven strangest research results.
Science says all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Again, studies speak for alcohol that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental use can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on this blocking gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway investigated how laughing affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is considered, according to many studies, is good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring more years, that is not disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute solvency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won an Oscar at the Olympics, he is more likely to live further than a regular bolt.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long age is due to a person's social status - which, on its part, allows for recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be pursued, for example.
A study on shopping behaviour for people over 65 found that a person shopping daily, is likely to be older than shopping.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring forward death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpi-human drunk driver derailed into a truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car beak crash took place on Friday night.
The accident occurred in Koske, mid-Kontie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came against had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left up in its lane after the crash, but caught fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and beyond the ditch on its roof.
Born in 1972, a woman who carried a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of a woman's blowfire was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sent loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk sweets because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So if you don't rush in the lawn cutting, the sign said.
The sign that foxes the merchant is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting.
Grass cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a little bit.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few patches were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed into the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to do a partial delivery (Saloon) in three, but we only took five pallets today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was first reported by the Evening News.
Teija Haltia was not indignant in the sign because he found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.
Dizzi weight loss! 30 pounds lightened Lotta Backlund released a picture of his change
The comedian producer has hoared tens of pounds since his child was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos on Instagram on Friday.

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures on Instagram for his soaring performance.
The picture shows how tremendously Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after picture pair has collected several commendable comments from co-evaporators.
You're great.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one glows.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a terrible amount of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when you are lying on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds on the Let It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he finally wanted to get to normal weight, which was then ten pounds away.
During the three-month fitness course, five pounds eventually fell.
Wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Recollections of the victim for police dogs
A family of 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update to convey the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary station recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work fearless.
Good friend.
We still cannot fully realize that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own courtyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer's tracking involved police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
The district court sentenced Posti for breach of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the District Court of Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
The district court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the detained salary and EUR 2,000 as a refund of discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have arrested only a part of the tutor's salary, which corresponded to the part of the induction throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU Association Decision of the Postal and Logistics Union on the prohibition of orientation.
During the November last year's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti employees will not familiarize themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its letter, the Journalists' Association asked Sipila and Soini to express their concerns in favour of freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland repeatedly brought out the importance of freedom of the press and speech to Turkey.
Putin fired the chief of his administration to replace Estonian persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, the grandson of Communist leader Karl Vaino of Soviet Estonia, will be held.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration's chief.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close insider, will join the Kremlin's special tasks in environmental and transport.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Perino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era for KGB espionage.
Many thought Ivanov was a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's withdrawal ban - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record of football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opened his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starring world-leading artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival event area is hidden with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a head stage and beer tent," says Thomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival, which will be held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors like to go to?
It is quite different in event productions that we think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow will be sold out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people last year by 5,000 people.
This year, the festival will feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things need to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that is controlled in huge pathways.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent of 15,000 people will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and award for the work done for Kallio is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s of the event, the operations were very dependent on the city of Helsinki's support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately EUR six million.
It can be used to produce "cres things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out primarily with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan group in his own genre, but he has not the most typical performer that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and she's been doing damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samomer Yoosumra said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was favored by Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to have rebel forces that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police have recently seized the activities of criminal organizations that are engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby sets will first go into battle in a war situation
In Akut, in a war situation, conscripts are not ordered for combat missions until several months after the military oath was sworn, says Keski Finland.
According to the Defence Forces Education Manager, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, interviewed by the magazine, for example, of the garrisons serving 5.5 months in the war situation are only those who are in the final stages of their education.
According to the Head of Education, reservists belonging to the readiness forces are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it emerged that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations even during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for homehouse
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough dispute about the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It maintained a district court judgment ordered the seller to pay a price reduction of 150,000 euros to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller is forced to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs for a total of €47,344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the apartment had already been known to buyers when making a housing store.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors of construction were substantially more serious than had been made.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola said in the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically sought a home in good condition because they did not want to take the repairs.
He had had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the fitness inspection report were no harm.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters flowing along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left to the impression that rainwaters from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly within a few years.
The shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it emerged that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 the building found microbial growth, which, according to Witnesses, were due to both rock rainwaters and capillary ground moisture.
On the west side, the house of microbial-polluted air could also get indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast that allows health risk, above the limits, was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also argued whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
The terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, based on the information they received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that the Court of Appeal had no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finnish people in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, USA, about a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi brides.
The documents and license cards come from the racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Office was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the matter.
The Race Office investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The intention was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be prepared to abandon their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency handwritten biographys and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Race Office wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not state what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum website reports.
Instead, Nazi demographic policies focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for receiving children.
The German mother's honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
Petäjä-Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first departure of the Finnjolls Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was the peak of the whole crowd in the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought RS:X-class day departures in places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at number 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so stiff"
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of the Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who has reached the cruise ship's bartender to 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance pallets and festivals, is still staggered and is currently in a wild lift.
Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, a book about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career for both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total rise as he won the crown of the tango king in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
The fairy tale castle became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song, however, did not go quite as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so on the canvas!
Bridgehead recalls in the book.
The recording of the song that became a huge hit would not immediately guess it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand a perfect and top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence about the man's most popular paragraphs, which the book reports, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about divorce were not true, but it was written based on the news of 7 days.
In the newspaper's news, the difference between Jari and ex-love was reported to be Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was full bullshit and was not true.
Jari called the book furiously to the record label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagd for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a scrapped booth in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In his latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is responding to the Brexit disaster from the profession.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of the position of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed people, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
They were particularly perceived by the BBC equity, which gave as much room for economists representing only a couple of percent of the economists who support the EU difference as the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letters combinations of the difference are.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were not cared about, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not have common interests.
Academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is an economy too
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant is congested by your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each café has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Each health center's waiting room can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they didn't exist?
Each school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the right British children get a school if they were to get rid of them?
Every municipality is home to foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and if they succeeded, their answers did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security, thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A more detailed preparation for the victory of the camp in favour of the EU gap began to be prepared a few weeks before the vote in case the result is broad.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large-scale liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We wanted to grow cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
In total, the company's funds are worth about £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even below it.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp in favour of the difference between the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good due to the cash collected, but it too had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they didn't really close trading, but changed pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is now worth pulling the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it was quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds, for example.
However, there were many surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds' trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
Open funds, which were covered by closures, dominate about 4% of British properties.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have become downwards, but the situation does not look "humor" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and the market also has a 15% discount sales compared to the period before Brexit voting.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit increases in London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't look very much yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power word was in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B's side now," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
The City of London was already completely alive despite the morning.
TV screens normally made silent at the office exhausted the news, and usually the loud people were completely quiet to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell him about his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought he would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate stores after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the British real estate market, and especially in London.
In London's office facilities, up to 20% minuses were anticipated in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still in the air.
It is not visible on the face of Vanhanen who spent its last summer holidays this week in Helsinki.
He still thinks it is far too early to say a lot about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference will happen and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information has already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The data from the real estate service company CBRE on price development cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, 6.1 per cent minus, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equal drops hit the years of crisis in 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting even because Brexit was compared quite quickly with Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the parable is not quite apt, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity," Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally found.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway
In fact, he does not think the price correction movement is a miracle - that could have been ahead without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other first cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
The drop started really high.
London prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, London's population as well.
Another big trend is that properties are the last ownership class that is globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment targets abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt leverage has now been used clearly less than during the 2008 boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, prices leveled up last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was some turn to be expected, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He dares not judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or even going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the pit is solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have dispersed, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail than before
Soon S Group knows what you are eating, as the trading group said today that it will start collecting even more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once information has been collected from the total of the receipt so far, the group will start to hug it from the purchased products in early May.
S Group will come after Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing with permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousomas.
He said Kesko is not going to react to the S Group registration change.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups, according to food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Interest customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planned for now.
Suomen Lähikata has its own First Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product groups, we remain at the level of the receipt total.
So we know in which store the purchases were made and the day and the customer receipt total.
We haven't gone to that level like K Group or S Group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program was to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
Basic information has included not only personal and address information but also the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method are stored from the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, the information from S bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
As of the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodi Terro and ABC chains, data are recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in the bags anyway, whether you want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes placed in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play it with its favorite toy.
A jar of shells for powder gas was revealed from the box next to which Heila sat.
The powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and online store admissions
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports when necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been confirmed," says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs' duties is mail items passing through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet store, up to 40 million mail items run through the airport each year, including military supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, and their precursors from Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be a big benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research," says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to train with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs of Customs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be reached at home without Hello, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from one-time.
The cameraman of the Evening Messages loses a camera mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila immediately returns a cover that looks like a soft toy from the "gir" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether education is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet the dog on top of the work vests, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner's care.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active sections last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for as the owner of Heila.
Luck hit Suntion, which has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than one million people in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has ordered August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off is held the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 pounds after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy withdrawals, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of work in Rio and 145 pounds for the rapture.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push for 175 pounds in his last, as did the other.
On the third company, the weights rose with wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of a Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian nodder Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian nods Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over ten player agents with over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemes meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
A daring Modern Family star is shining again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern Family comedy series, again, Ariel Winter blinks by introducing his voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder.
The star has posed in its photos on social media in very few clothes and had numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter on the eve of adulthood has also recently released several pictures of itself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show up, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more revealing the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so tough, one woman on Winter's Instagram says.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge you not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glowing a young woman.
Japanese prefer to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract the Japanese to start the Northern Lights trips already in early autumn," Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations for Japanese Northern Light Tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly combined with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is very demand for winter northern lights in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts from early autumn and continues far into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the northern lights making the vision two-fold fairytale, says Anne Lind, Vt. Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Light campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would miss clearer unique attractions from Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver with Fidi master class leading to gold
The UK's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to the final challenge of Fiji in the Thursday evening final when the team experienced a 43-7 crush defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master course in reading, chewed, evasive, support game, running lines and sheer power when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of Britain's Day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semi-finals played earlier that day from South Africa could bother them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of top 15 people in this condition.
Great Britain may be able to - but probably not - comforting that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, former English boss of Wimbledon.
The British journey has been quite a bit.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they only lost one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started out excellently rejecting UK tackles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running moving buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived at the corner to the goal area.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led the goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male-mountain Leone Nakarawa's third goal, but it was just a slow-motion for Fiji.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, and the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored another start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...the first half.
Vatemo Ravou then plunged through UK loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the situation was 29-0 when the break was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's exactly the case.
In a break, the UK made a bunch of changes that blocked Fiji's dam for four minutes, which compared to the first half was well until Josua Tuisova scored after Fiji's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored for the UK when he scored at the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea whose supporters sang, waved tickets, and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's joyful approach.
Mata Viliame with his last minute goal had a frosting in Fiji's cake, which did not need to frost.
The whistle was whistled, the fidites hugged, and Great Britain fell on grass, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semi-final 20-5, and the UK won South Africa in a tight semi-final, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with dazzling footwork and scored under the paint poles in the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the 15-aside rubby team in England, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning into rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 tough twists towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning at Estacio da Lagoa in their golden moment.
Although they were rowing alone, the boat had three votes, and coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when the two denied their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairing race - the first women in British sports history books that achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance invincible, which is also record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes connecting a swan with sweetness on the surface, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, after receiving a cancer diagnosis 30 months ago, knew if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was narrow.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to have his treatment started in early 2014 outside the season, causing as little disturbance as possible - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first in the couple's thoughts was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional ruin this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just emphasizes how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he's very grateful, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors did not reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, as New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very attached in an instant.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we're just working for a good row and winning the race, and we did.
A couple are waiting for a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
It took about six months after London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to switch Panama leak-crapped government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are claimed by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes with tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the autumn election result.
In the June presidential election, the criticality of those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claims Obama was founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest noises.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton also involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that down, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims prefer to cover the use of burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited by anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manner and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear, which grandly express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to ISIS attacked church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - in Pyykösjärvi blue-leak seam
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue algae opacment has been observed on the shore of Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, environmental operations in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits given in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococcal levels of the water on Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue-green algae morning observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water sleepable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, forming blue-green algae mass in rafts.
Environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue algae opacity turns into blue algae bloom, the bathing beach bulletin board will also be announced separately.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in next year's budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on forest farm generation change.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal has four goals: to promote generational changes in forest farms, rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, increase forest farm size and increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good," comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism of the tax change proposal.
Forest gift reduction is presented for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal assumes from it, by making a reduction in clean capital income in forestry, prevents the loss of forestry capital income, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if it doesn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the forest's return value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the holding.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail shower surprised motorists with Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rearing in the Kalajoki Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars driving in a row derailed into the ditch, after which the one who came behind collided after driving ahead.
According to the on-call firemaster Harri Pyyhti, the derailment of the ditch is suspected of being caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove before was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few miles towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results of researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effective.
The findings made by the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignant nature of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be able to improve by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family house killing continues at court, prosecutor claims murder sentence for other perpetrators
Muhos' family house killing continues at court for both convicted people.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years 4 months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of gross endangering road safety as a young person and the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The district court's sentence was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and a man with a more severe conviction.
The prosecution calls on a man who has been punished to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the district court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as the instructor of the child welfare unit in the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had gotten out of the grip and trampled the young person into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
Among other things, the director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental state study, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had planned to escape a family home since at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing until the age of 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, reports a study published in Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic such as Greenland, an ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not increase until the age of 156.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only a centimeter a year.
Only a species of clams are known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The researchers discovered age with radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw one way or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
Up to one third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he introduced it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a really staggering amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived altogether.
Trump accused the state of excessive regulation of business and driving small businesses bankrupt.
The decided environmental standards for the rash must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector is dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be discussed again.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump said the "smooth" trade policy is one of the main causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be disbanded.
There would be a 45% penalty tax on imports from China and a 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel lifts new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday for Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street grain - accounting with the past can begin.
It summed up the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous steering job Travel Lovers (2013) was a tiny and ronskin-sided satirical comedy, the preceding Skin I live in (2011) the peaks of a Spanish artist's career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a serene love, relationship and family drama of conventionally, with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is amazed all the way to the rest of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times his daughter who grew up the stages of her life.
She begins the time before the daughter was born, at the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, a TV-supported time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that it's pretty cleverly and literally with a one-time wipe.
Almodóvar films often characterized by such ambiguity, up to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is a equally played, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite sad, with such elements of elegia.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there and in such a way that it begins to sting more slowly in the eye as a pure shape than a working dramatic power.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costume: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the scene at hand, do not particularly improve.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is external and little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a script on the basis of the three short stories of Alice Munro, a Canadian Prize-winning Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-thick written literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably even more robust drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are carried out by a roap shop.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (c.) under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic security of unemployment and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so hard that no new cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes different directions from government parties, will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the government party of the Finns Party expects a sludge loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest by 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, many of whom will be realised next spring the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the governments of the three parties about as large depends on the fact that the British can last.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come, first of all, the fact that next year they will be done violently and secondly, trying to soften the historic attack on the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of a shift in debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to hold on to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session on top of the former.
The budget would be ravaged at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will be accepted what comes.
With these measures, debt is not folded
It is quite clear that with the current actions, indebtedness does not fold, no matter how Juha Sipilä tries to foment a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget bulletin prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR three billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will reach 70% in the mid-year.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks for municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of children's day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, is evident from the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also scroll responsibility to an individual municipality from libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province, on the other hand, is the most obvious desire for provincial zoning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
None of the tasks responsible for the order of municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from the police patrol in Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half a.m.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from which to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the more fast-legged police ran to the fugitive.
The blow faith for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross risk of road safety.
A truck in the stone cargo fell into the ditch
A truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on the Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on his side to the ditch.
The rescue services lifted the injured driver through a door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
The vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on Ilmajoki
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahti Village in South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman with white hair that extends under the jaw of about 165 centimeters.
Observations and clues about the lost movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre's tip number 0295440513.
Major accident ingredients in the air - see the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The surge flow that knocked down the parafest festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be financially noble, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of Friday night in the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 3 pm.
The program is held as planned.
The surge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward air flow.
Changes in the water state of the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the downward air mass cools and its pace towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is reported that rush flows occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of crash flows is difficult to predict.
The crash flow hit the Joensuu Art Museum's backyard, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in total.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child who was transported mildly injured in further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an peers living in rural areas.
Fine particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A Cac study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel walking around congested streets.
London residents may try to protect yourself from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed - pushed a man standing in front
He had moved rocks in his yard on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and gone to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor could push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Championship, will leave the series that will be launched in October from a better starting point than to memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.
A common tune can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säis, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, a middle-doctor from the foreign trio, begins his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who has appeared on the Rwandan national team, is a 20-4'4 mutter.
Garchet is a passar respectively, Brazilian has 198 cents.
Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Cup since 2003.
Now the sixth races are already in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I was working in the market and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The US was establishing a floorball national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at SM level as floorball.
The telegram was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM series with the university for the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with the game, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
The Joensuu-based floorball club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Eno-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki-based Wilderness, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men's national matches, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen of Switzerland, Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from the thigh diaper and is part of the national team's standard fleet with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of Seinäjoki Gaming Brothers, was also named the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, the head coach of the Finnish Floor, is the head coach of the Finnish Floor.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be settled this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over three days, medals are played in both adult and young leagues.
In collaboration with the SM final tournament organised by Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, will be eligible for the top six pairs of the rankings of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by Elimäki's YMCY, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the Pessis Stadium.
I have not played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals at home corners, Hasu tunnels.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark into sports and gave good lunches to a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 at Elimäki's YMCA's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big a jersey, the knee pads on the ankles, and the staggering ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the club president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice for indoor volleyball counterbalance during junior.
A party has been played on the curve pond beach since the 1990s.
The activities have always been active in the toilets.
I also went to follow the junior SM tour races thinking that one day I would be there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki this weekend in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo's goal is clear.
The realistic goal we have a medal.
SM-gold, we still lack the prize cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be Hasu's last in front of a familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are waiting for civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow poured tents at the disabled event in Joensuu, the major accident was close
The crash flow poured three tents at the Parafest festival for people with disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one larger tent.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Firemaster Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the paper that the situation had the ingredients for the disaster.
The paper says the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly left as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working as a continuation of their home space, along with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Kol.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt-taking and increasing the farm size so that the bread could come in the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I have always loved to be on the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I have put everything on the game.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I really went into the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will still be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cars, aims to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for a young food producer in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria first reports inflation in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation measured by the cost of living index was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase was observed in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says anime has served as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows for about 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, dog, or character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial twisting tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app advertises a blackface, or "blackface" mask or favors bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens for some users this week that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface," or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's larger problem regarding diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said he had shut down the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photos were widely distributed, said in her email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison with a side by side with a outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme degradingness.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood, and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of more racially older young people can mean they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, "it's much harder for these guys to be unobtrusive."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu mainly criticized the company's white male leadership and finished his writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Do they have no diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions of this kind," Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to the representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and take forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding, "Is it the case that they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
Congress panel says military officials distorted ISIS intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, the Congressional Panel said that intelligence reports were shaped from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces Military Military Division to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what events justified on the ground.
The interim report of a team set up by the Republican Presidency, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Fund Subcommittee found "wide dissatisfaction" among headquarters intelligence analysts who said that superiors tampered with their estimates of Americans' efforts to win ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the military war jurisdiction in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The outputs of intelligence accepted by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the US anti-terrorism efforts than justified by the facts on the ground. They were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other authors of the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom events are impossible to accept - our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," spokesman Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
Centcom management failures reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems of headquarters descriptions and analyses of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the Obama administration's high-ranking administrators ordered reports to tamper with, it describes that analysts felt like Centcom leaders put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, ISIS.
"Over the first half of 2015, many headquarters press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back Mosul could start even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still in ISIS' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders at the U.S. Armed Forces Military Military Headquarters manipulate the proceeds of headquarters intelligence to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created a team after hearing that analysts had raised concern that intelligence from the Islamic state was manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more extensive results while the investigation is underway.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has begun an extraordinary, ongoing investigation into Centcom's inquiry.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Adam B. Schiff, the committee's leading Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "longed the release of intelligence outputs", worsened mood among analysts and "give enough room for different perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions to "pre-set or political narrative".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's chief inspector has launched an investigation after Centcom analysts' complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congress report as long as the superintensor's investigation is underway.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential national security topics."
The study has other aftermath than just the question of whether US-led bombing measures in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defense authorities now claims).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on headquarters to deliver honest estimates of military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
Review of Islamic State intelligence reflects a dispute over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite protests by several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding Islamic state intelligence.
Authorities said last year, Hooker's group concluded that despite the contrary public statements, air strikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's country hockey, holding an interim clarification with Britain
The day after the team scored three goals when the team won 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday when the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But this is what he knows: Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan on Thursday 2-0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarters, and this game determines who ranks first and who is second in their six-team group.
First ranked, avoids a strong Dutch, second group leader, slightly longer at the start of the quarter finals.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, Americans have aroused controversy with their surprising success here, four years after they were the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up the ground hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (he his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) related to the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to join the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we have now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started making the first half goal with a knuckle near the paint.
India had entered the game with any wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then toured the middle and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to a 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to let one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good tune.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoliin peace in the midst of the Olympic most frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time is, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem like a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming bat, which is transmitted from the archer to the swimmer and gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to the conversation of a fellow man next to the coffee shop in line without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic first-timer and future heart crusher with a smile pit, could well be one of the names that everyone knows that is presented at the best viewing time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-minded TV ads - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade, are the species that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a chest, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, its presence is so few observations in the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not progress until the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medal.
However, Trampoliin is associated with a certain kind of underdog charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
The species has opportunities for amusingness, as noted by the color of the endless bounces of cartoons, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming jump, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means springboard.
The master's reachers jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of nearly 30 feet, and they must perform rolling motion sequences (turns, folds and volts) and eventually descend on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated based on implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those who wish to measure must go further, faster, up and over when looking for gold - sometimes all the way to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt a finish line or a starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another sling border: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even make the viewer's tears.
But that's also the reason why watching the games can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest from this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, affecting weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this lacks competition or difficulty, but there is no fierce rush towards the end during the program, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen space as can be reached at the Olympics.
Women's qualifying competitions and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's races will also come on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon software starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, attractive moment that is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to stare and objectable (as male gymnasts in the United States some time ago suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley just expects his sighing new fan base.
"Slager Shows" in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, protests against the government in recent months have shaken the country as they spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police fired and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spreaded videos recorded in demonstrations, believed to be from the end of last year or from the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people in light while forcing them to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' main human rights authority is now calling for extensive research.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country will receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa has even a new train for commuters.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, while Ethiopia has not been a model image of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken about government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Etopia, said.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover all the coalition ruling from land use into a strangulation extract.
After the much-rated elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to take advantage of turmoil and rearm.
Numerous factors explain why, under years of surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the internet service improved.
Even if the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through location-hiding network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, oromos and amharas, get along better.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the amharas, who come from Ethiopia's mainly Christian highlands, were successful in politics and business, taking advantage of oroms, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this is changing too.
"We are on our way to organize under one umbrella," Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many amharas and oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people. The people cover about 6% of the population and dominates armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Current government has no basic instinct like that," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that tigre-controlled security services do not trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
Ethiopia was last in the power of such turmoil in 2005 when thousands protested about the elections that analysts said seemed that the government first and then robbed them.
In the ensuing intensive attack, many protesters died, although less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders from visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and considerable advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly, this has not stopped the intensification of contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable allies to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there is real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based ISIS claim as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy that took over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious when he was numerous times this week incited that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American audience.
It also put his defenders, who have been struggling to defend him during a turbulent period, in a difficult position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After a hint at the Wednesday campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same more and more enthusiastically in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in early Friday morning's Twitter, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a turnaround from the previous day when Trump said in several interviews he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump defect his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, a Republican presidential candidate took this in his hearing ears.
The latest critical storm comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amidst the results of the polls that are falling into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought while talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Again, fleeing to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes, and that he gave the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July after he faced extensive criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I guess I'm sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then return if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' direction or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's cunning about his statements and knows they're vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a major voting audience, Trump has been more thicker in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, released on Friday, showed that Trump lags out after Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump, as a rule, seeks to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an ever closer look at the presidential campaign over the past few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to a lot of effort to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost an unknown, small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on news media that grinds every word of him and are biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts trying to find out about him, saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was inappropriate for president.
A previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, only cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, which had no wireless network, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street arm on Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a middle-class city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it is also re-inventing.
The revived Verb opened last November to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and has the same unscaught atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe, the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same kind of espresso machine.
It even used the lights of old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu contains bacon-cane cheese sandwiches, and capers and browned onions are available on the coatings, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regular clients.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers too," he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a moment.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his regular ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making spicy bagelia with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes her usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, she orders with spicy bagel bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge for a soap shop that took over the old spaces.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare Verb for a special soap, which would use the coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also approved the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up soon on some point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
A local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-cut coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the adjacent building.
Many customers are enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When a new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he was coming home while walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: depression paralyzing food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office room.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as a foy liver pastry, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree, and plum pudding for dessert.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message for Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life from the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some form of their own culinary solidarity, they meet with a journalist at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsceasing lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression period.
"The bites were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut moorx, liver moorie, bean moose.
They were made from the ingredients and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Coe ravist.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in the stomach," he said.
In years before the recession on American tables, especially in the countryside, it was like eating-so-much-jaksat-noction table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways the nation survived that it suddenly was no longer a country of abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing subject for Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes such as crumbs and boxes became the main foods, and the box was a "great way to use food residues," mentioned Ziegelma, because chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparing luxury product.
Special compilations were tried with calorie levels and nutrient levels more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While conducting research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman produced an era dish where fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is not suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, directed the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to start as "budgeters" and to meet the challenge of converting lumps like puree spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me eat cake attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxed dining room wearing a tux.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered one of Washington's most dreary, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the paralytic eating methods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The inheritance is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing a book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she couldn't throw food away.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone sank their spoons reluctantly in a sticky, brown lister.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sang once and another.
Sounds like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead is reimbursed for lawyer costs in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to receive the attorney costs it incurred in a dispute about hepatitis C patient against pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in payments after violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvoni, which followed when a U.S. judge discovered Merck's abuses, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a sentence filed on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to be freed from the compensation it suffered in the fight against the action.
Merck tries to catch Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for the ownership of laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir active agent for Gilead drugs.
US-backed forces say they have taken over Manbij, ruled by ISIS.
U.S.-backed forces have taken over the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border, since the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 strained flags held captive by fighters, Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally force, Manbij's military council, told Reuters.
"The city is now under full control, but we have started investigating it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released his 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Secretary announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster for his book about her career in the State Department.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, released 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a standard for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and cancels his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to usual, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have invoked the tax government's audit as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties with Russia, for example.
Clinton has addressed the problem, releasing an online video on Friday that brought up visible Republicans who urged Trump to release their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate of the last few decades has done: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very few taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist borrowed numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett to ensure that those who earn over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, located there by the Berkshire Hathaway Conglomerate, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also running a tax government check, and that Trump will not "fear" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an affordable, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance Tanzanian elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual way to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The way has proven to be effective, and the idea was invented by the Honeyguide Foundation, along with the Nature Conservancy in the United States, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in northern Tanzania villages to use a nonviolent four-step way to protect homes and hundreds without animals being injured.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have observed a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing an invading elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, let's throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground, as well as a sparkle, after which the condom is rotated so that only the ignition wire remains visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts with roasting and bursting chili powder dust into the air.
One touch is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is the trigger who shoots a Roman candle in the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area number at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary film about the Holocaust, broke his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country's area number list offered by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new German, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of the explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there "shocked him."
The hotel's recipe-onist said it was "The Thoughtful Decision of Kempinski Hotel Management".
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli area code," the employee said, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and this hotel chain in question.
This doesn't need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gived" to alleged claims by Arab customers.
"Get out," said another publication, which pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel himself quickly denied all charges and called the "unobservable" and "forgive" Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel in the Quick Choice List was never made," Kempinski's spokesman reportedly said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who demonstrate their minds
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to protest against government public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break up a group of students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to proposals by Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out as one force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested from office, with the country's Senate voting for his tenure.
RT Business: trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly growing by 71%
Since the removal of sanctions, the turnover of the trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagary.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown great interest in business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagary said.
He pointed out that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period of 2015, with a total of $856 million.
Russia's exports to Iran in particular rose by 91.5%, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth of trade was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagary is waiting for a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Representative Council in Iran granted Iranian citizens about 35,000 visas, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries that visited the most tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They have kept monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner crashed as the British caught cycling gold
Callum Skinner in Scotland praised the men's team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the British team's trio defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in a role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man when he went to the finish line, grabbing the advance favorite of the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly ranked sixth at the March World Rally Championship in London, although Hoy has since finished his race.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of Special Sender Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who British coaches held in front of the Scottish potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny who won the championship with Hoy four years ago and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation and included Hindes' driving at a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old person, said, "Comparition is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later pulled his comment back and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "It felt like it was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply great.
One event, one gold medal for the people, which won seven out of ten cycling sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are waiting for a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on the condition shown by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic golds in one of the Olympics.
That would mean that the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (on that apparently sacred day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It's won with friends.
Winning alone is honestly lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest four-person, four-mile team chase in time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The 2012 gold record in London is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins is certainly the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time periods when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The UK team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, the smallest of which have not been the difference between technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, as well as the end of the race career of big people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on first-night competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the now legendary reputation of the UK will rise to its peak at a perfect moment could be true once again.
The future of Portland's smelting is questionable due to cutting electricity contract
The future of Portland's Victoria's aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity company that distributes electricity to the factory revealed that one of the factory owners is ending a distribution agreement, so a cut of all distribution agreements is expected.
The measure follows the decision made by the Victorian administration earlier this year that the subsidies required to keep the factory in operation will not be extended.
The maturity of the 20-year specified period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's smelter loses money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of the factory production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects three other owners to decide their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the molten physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements" that were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they actually end in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects contracts to deliver results for the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible performance impacts for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already "in anticipation of termination" reduced the value of contracts in its accounting by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoan ... the ability to keep the smelting operation or secure the supply of electricity from the smelt."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was to come into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why he withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been on guard both the Portland smelter in Victoria and also due to the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, as the industry's economic situation is poor.
Earlier a week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts each year.
"If both factories leave the market, it is a significant reduction in [electricity] market demand.
For us, as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, fourth daughter of the clan of Kris Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of the desired September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and was a model at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of dear people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just a Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and was accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment set, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but ended at a classic turn: they planned a surprise party.
It is a cliché plot pattern on almost every children's television series "birth date period" (Seacrest utters the lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn bunny drink), but Kris had to make her other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to a new Kardashian era with the September Vogue site.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have reached Vogue's cover first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion calculated that last year's 832-page opus 615 was advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is expected so fiercely that for the last two years the images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on deck have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities that serve as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's honorary position.
But if it happened that Jenner, who the magazine describes as a "success model" of his generation, would hit the former category, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "more than a moment".
This feeling came to the surface again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But spinning in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all his sisters sell you pictures of himself in his own applications behind the paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter she took to LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further financial cuts on its already extreme activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who do not have the opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the community prepare for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centers are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of legal centers in the Queensland Community, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need each year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippled debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate among complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the level of the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk Board must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued that they allegedly did nothing after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina action chief threatened the employee in February while they were driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in an action filed by former software trainee Vincent Bordin on Wednesday in Charlotte, a state court.
Bordini said for months he waited for months to deal with the situation internally before realizing that "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "showed a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After applying to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"There is no need to trigger the weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "people of another addition" - which usually includes gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and were allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he is not in favor of violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond to the comment request immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, as we went to tremendous effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new traineeships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, as well as removing youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come with thought that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games, and that we would be ashamed before the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is presented to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and an economic growth of £211 billion, as well as leaving the heritage of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, T2 built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway supported by £16 billion in private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is also.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Righton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Cat and Mouse Play for Blocking Ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, companies bypass the program that blocks ads are "cat and mouse play," said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad inhibitors on their computer-based pages, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update the program filters to prevent ads on the social network pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code on its website will be changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's orbited a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-trip battle between the open source advertising-blocking community and its orbiters has been underway since the ad block was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great deal of ad blockers have become to the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million use ad blockers, reports last year's Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is after the ad blockers of computer-used pages, as mobile ad inhibitors do not work in Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram," the spokesman said.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to make Facebook look worth investing this type of action.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it dailyed its "advertise" tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-adverted content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Ad inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit car on Swiss freeway apparently due to suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway during the early hours of Thursday, in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and settled in the dark lying on a road where she was hit by several vehicles," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the event have already been questioned, but not everyone has yet been identified, police who appeals to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
Criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the involved drivers will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It will remain for the prosecutor to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases of the past five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, both of which had a person who walked on a dark freeway, it was estimated that motorists can't wait to meet a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted against the death of neglect after he hit and killed a man who was lying on A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police who were reacting to the emergency call were in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely to be once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies research center developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled air circles could sometimes have ground-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30% fainter sun.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus reveals it to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth's current ones.
The model produced a story of Venus' development, similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have been habitable at some time, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere was left with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche coach's job
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the actions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey, saying the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's vice president/Chairman Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as Vice President and Head Coach of the Colorado Avalanche hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the view of the coach and the vice president of hockey matters must be fully aligned with the organization's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently realised.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him happiness in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award to the best coach in the league in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division win, but Minnesota knocked down in the first round of the Colorado playoffs, and the team has not been able to go on in the last two years.
Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference wild card playoff spot.
The Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
Industrial battles for North Sea oil workers are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service company Wood Group have been held randomly on North Sea drilling rigs led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to resume a process aimed at resolving the current dispute," the joint statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings starting early next week so we can take a fresh view for problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in over 25 years, was an objection to possible, up to 30% pay cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors' fees by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's remuneration deduction follows a 10% reduction of contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary mode of movement to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has reduced thousands of people from their payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its giant fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's summer decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's largest North Sea work disputes.
He said the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in investments in new projects is expected in the North Sea, while the previous five-year average has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation speed in Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the rotation speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
New information helps astronomers understand why star stars rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we are now learning more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even its history of the solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared processing and analysis, said in a press release.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the group were born about 125 million years ago, and are right now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
With its high speed of spinning, these growing stars plunge large amounts of star wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers who make devils slower than smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow circulators are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing star properties at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades' cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars to theoretical models that comprise both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
