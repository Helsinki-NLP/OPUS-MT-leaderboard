Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed as mentally ill, and now she makes art on the subject - "A person should have a right to his own body"
Dozens of patient records hang from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts Project room.
Each of them reads Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outside people have written up their interpretations of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you my personal medical history to make the violence in the process visible," Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year-long research period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process begins with a referral to diagnosis studies of "gender identity disorder", which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
In Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was well advanced in his own repair process anyway.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that gender can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the Act on Strengthening the Gender of Transsec Sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to forced sterilization in order to get the right sex into a population register centre and passport, for example.
Currently, a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive inability are required for every sex remedy.
A person has the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is unbearable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translain has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight comments on the law and the European Court of Justice of Human Rights has a preliminary decision obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change in the law under the leadership of then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections came and the Finns Party entered the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
It is a matter of domestic political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty International's Finnish Department.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two major installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist of the Transpoli at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a story based on these that would define Auer's right to receive care and help.
The consciousness of the reality being studied appears exposed to faltering.
The subject's perception of self appears fragmented in a border-level way and the unstable features associated with personality are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted sex-repair therapy.
According to medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
At the time, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpoli waiting lobby into the television.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was born on that television, where Auer reflects his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but it needs a diagnosis to remove your breasts," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are other than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is more difficult for many for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, citing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many who seek the process have psychological symptoms behind: depression, anxiety, potential bullying experiences.
On the basis of these, medical staff may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that is something that people usually find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in childhood and teens.
Why the wide chin didn't seem to fit your own body and why the chest muscles should be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people near him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify so much by talking, dressing, using voice and movements," he says.
Today, Auer feels he is already seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts most when loved ones are misgendered.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't or can't internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, no official confirmation of one's own gender can be obtained.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of the legal sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination in terms of legal sex.
The adult applicant makes a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he or she feels of the other sex.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry will issue a new personal identity code to the applicant.
This sovereignty is also required for Finland and this requirement is also crystallized by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil Rights Organization issued travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which promotes African-American civil rights, has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP travel newsletter for Missouri will come into force on August 28, 2017 and calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution while traveling in a state where numerous questionable racial events have recently occurred," the organization said in a statement.
The recent law, which entered into force in Missouri, makes it difficult to export discrimination cases to court, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionately directed at minorities. According to NAACP, these factors led to a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are stopped by skin color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri president Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of as many cases before in an equally short time."
The travel bulletin for Missouri is the organization's first warning about the state of the United States.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel.
The travel release also referred to a statement by the Missouri Attorney General that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than white.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be wary and warn their families, friends, and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People must prepare, for example, by involving money to pay guarantees or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, the highest number of hate crimes, or the highest number of U.S. states.
Travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for companies to sue discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU organization, who defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that oblige police to arrest people from immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and apply to other states, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO's supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, Minister of Economic Affairs in charge of the State Ownership Guidance, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension contribution received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is in conflict with the state's will expression.
The supplementary pension of EUR 130,000 received by Vauramo emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
The Finnish Kuvalhti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would waive supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has agreed that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company said the decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on corporate governance.
Sanctions immediately increased speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met in connection with the G20 in Hamburg, seemed to be getting along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
New economic sanctions adopted by the United States Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were reacted bitterly in Russia.
The most stunning response has been heard so far from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a "full trade war."
Even if Russian reactions are only offset as exacerbations and excesses of political rhetoric, the tightening of the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month after Trump's election.
In the United States, the passing of the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Congress, however, passed the law with considerable consensus, but the president was much more difficult to accept the law, as reported.
Trump recently criticized the law he signed "significantly inadequate."
President Trump's sprain may have been the cause of Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting its own powers must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States on both Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's Russian connections.
The tightening of the relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of honeymoon.
As the White House staff have changed to a tight and various scandalous twists have almost been revealed to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being made in the United States under the leadership of the president but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the Russia relationship is a kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core Baltic Sea is also tightening relations.
The EU has prominently held the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united in its policy on Russia, at least on the surface, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that makes a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make many European companies more difficult.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important to the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has a Statue of Liberty
Addressing the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, poured Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideologies of the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word test on the president's proposal to reduce legal immigration considerably.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organizers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was the significance of the statue, and especially the fact that in 1903 the poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal —17 years after the statue was completed.
Miller was radiating Acosta: "I don't want to go to history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in itself, but it's not just about history, as he himself said.
The essential are Lazarus' touching words, the only ones of its kind, where the state calls not only immigrants but "the poor poorest": "Your tireed, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearing to beathe free, / The Wretched reason of your teaming shore."
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, and he made it clear that the "poor poorest" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the importance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal, and they knew well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to manifest the connections of French and American republicanism by classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
The incorporation of the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh — a kisser who can now be considered some kind of sign of Trump — claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of neoconservatives, taking the torch of the United States into a world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty comes forward.
He takes freedom to torch from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the statue of freedom depends entirely from a perspective.
Lazarus saw it like poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
Their torch does not lead the way, but stirs the flames of anger, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the leader of the UK Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, Scotland "there is something special" that UK athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it long enough to understand what's going on," Black says.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the union's activities,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is based on their activities.
And an ordinary streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something absolutely great, which is why."
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah for a 5,000-metre run. Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredibly stunning," Black says.
"Sports left the event proudly about their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidhi's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in a 400-metre fence run, and these are his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "incredible" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a mid-distance runner, has run five UK and two European records in the year.
He competes in London for 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and he is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes wins in the UK World Cup Qualsies and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scottish of the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "huge proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
"Getting into captain is a great honour anyway, but it is even more special because the members of the national team voted the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the Scots who got to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize positions.
My Captain's speech?
I think it went just fine.
I focused on how lucky we were to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be amazing."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
Our country's father knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began criticizing him for all possible domestic policies to his political principles.
Criticism must have irritated,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led foolish and quiet as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Federation sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was downplaying online as well.
"What difference? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best reviews of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hotroll.
He has led the state firmly and firmly adhered to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his voters and published a picture of his baldness in chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking users from the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintain with tax money.
Hogan spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, and he said it was just a question of modernizing comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spam or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, considerate, and proper.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked the question of hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments on the Washington Post news.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately considered an organized crowd and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "focused attack". Someone else could call them important to promote things that are considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It is really the same thing, now just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official accused of wading Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudou County government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution in preventing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation visited Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At Washington's time, low-cost postage had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they barked at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, i.e. the US-UK Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement, as shown in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about fifty locations, and also online announcements from a couple of three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then individual from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Greenheads have died from a parachomonosis shine.
It is caused by an protozoa, a scientific name Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially the pulge.
However, in the 21st century, the disease also began to be detected from peippolinny.
In 2009, it was really hard.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a large collapse in the green finch in Finland, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have been sick green finches now, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of the Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus) at the University of Helsinki.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former Europe's first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage for the next three days when Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Northern Irish Rafferty led the tournament held next door to Archerfield Links last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new place and serves as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvad, the club founder and CEO.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at their best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is the avid ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great introduction to this field."
Eales is defending the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," the player living in Southport says.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to go back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to real action on his own soil, and he went on tour after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty strongly.
I am happy with my game so far."
The trio will be followed by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking in the car costs five pounds if the car has only a driver, and £10 if there is at least two people in the car.
All proceeds are donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In Säkylä, possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade's communications company at least so far, the brigade reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
The reports began when a man who interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health weakened the barracks due to poor indoor air.
Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff at Pori Brigade, said no problems have been identified in the health situation of other conscripts.
It turned out that it was an individual case and no health problems have been affected by other servants in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to work this out thoroughly.
It is not known at the moment that we have any indoor air problem," Holma says.
Brigat's statement says that due to the July arrival batch, goods must have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have allowed dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of that, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use stove in cooking.
He rarely uses a boiler.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato — locally "nota" — directly to the fireplace.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten with a voraciously bare, unwashed hands.
There is no furniture in Degei's home, sitting on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as in cloudy water picked up from a nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet is delivered by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and is not assigned fields to be treated.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969, preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village prices were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, who opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger into Jakarta's government, which keeps the area under strict control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and bleak, and the journey begins on an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a five-hour drive on a rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated rust has been dyed into yellow browns.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries came, Papua's Mee Pago tribes worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have occurred.
"We didn't have clothes like this," Degei says. She means his colorful, hand-woven wrap headgear, dark skirt and bright colored blouse.
"Before we only had leaves as a cover of our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian gold country.
Paniai is a highlands about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants. Only about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of wood reserves.
However, for the Papuas, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of Indonesia's strong army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with up to $150,000 paid individual officers.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are silenced without mercy.
Human rights activists say the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 papuan since 1969 and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of Papua tribes in the 1970s gained proportions of genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people in the region were arrested by Indonesian police in peaceful demonstrations.
The Brisbane Archdioces report We Will Lose Everything of 2016 has reports of previous year's atrocities such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means — and ruthless attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws have been tightened when Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes move Muslims to the region in hopes of a better livelihood.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado green essay in peanut sauce.
Locals find it difficult to compete.
"Changers have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a lower price than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and moved to the province's capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to intervene in Papua's injustices and human rights violations in his 2014 election campaign.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's presidential castle.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Panias experienced some kind of wave base just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The feared children told the soldiers that they should use headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark, and according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
Reports of victims and Witnesses say drunken soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell as a result of a coma assault.
A couple of hours later, the state election board building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to take place.
About 1,000 papuan — young men and women and children — gathered at the football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They had hunting springs for festive rites, and they began to play the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, where they dance in the ring and imitate the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere heated, the soldiers were ordered in the internal radio system: "If crowds resist more than three times, shoot them as death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been announced to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader in the Kego Koto area, sensed the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"There were several shots fired in the population."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I drank to him and made sure it was indeed him," Yohanes told TIME magazine sad. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that police were just "protected" police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many injured.
Knowledge of the killings was carried to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that Papua violence would be addressed.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that never happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speeches immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he wasn't going to start surveys in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the death of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of Papua human rights violations, including the events of Pania.
Families of Paniai victims are bleak unbelieving about claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this already."
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Italians are afraid to discuss the event.
He reports that he had been abused by the soldiers after he had helped bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will find me in their hands after the victims were buried," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai in Deiya.
One was killed and 17 was injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which originated when the director refused to take a man who lost consciousness to the hospital.
The man who needed hospitalization was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in water while fishing on a nearby river, who died on his way to the hospital.
The hated villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, locals say the mobile police unit of Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire towards the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified, and we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded were brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for fired police officers to be held accountable and a moving police unit is withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem with the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which live on Papua's lush middle highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels, which claims to defend the rights of the papuan by occasional attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Paniaista, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The military has responded to the rebellion by arrest and arbitrarily capture thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of the detainees never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals,
As well as bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest are sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in local and migrants' livelihoods have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and usually go to better educated and wealthy migrants than locals.
Few beans have enough capital and expertise to run their own company competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is given little attention in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escuudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare filming permit, the official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises, and he has not increased transparency and contributed to development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Indonesia's restless eastern provinces on Papua and Western Papua have new risks: refusing a visa and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of action of the press means that the Indonesian government is only pressured by Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "read and widespread violations", including the Paniai shooting.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up evidence of human rights violations would be difficult."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When the Dutch official delegation led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, says an anonymous source who participated in the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the beans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi anymore.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Italians: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, practically without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Italians, like the other beans, consider the votes they gave to Jokow as a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again showed resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the military office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let the responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says head in the depressions.
"What else can we do?"
Derek Chisora barks at Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Derek Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 in Hartwall Arena.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora rolls the reason for flopping the rematch on Helenius in a recent interview with IFL TV.
My match in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora is rude.
Helenius and Chisora first met in a full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point sentence.
The ticket sales of the rematch went subdued, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match.
However, the cancellation is no longer annoying Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled after Chisora got sick anyway.
On Thursday, three days before the time of the match, I woke up in severe pain.
The tyrant was about to explode.
The hospital said I needed to be cut, Chisora says.
The British says he is currently in about 45% condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in the sights are Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss for Whyte in December with dispersal.
Fire took over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai on Friday, with hundreds of residents forced to flee a 79-story building 337 metres high.
This was the second fire within two years in a building called Torch, torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured, and there was no idea of the fire's cause immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and we woke up with the sound of the fire alarm and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue officials said the fire was able to extinguish the fire at four in the morning local time and remained cooling the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left its home.
The case can re-emerg questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of high buildings around the world.
The Torch building board commissioned a study after the 2015 fire, which found that the most damage suffered the plates used for facade cladding and insulation.
In the UK, police believe that London's Grenfell Tower insulation and cladding plates could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from Joensuu parking lot during the night
A moped was stolen from the Joensuu parking lot between Tuesday at 9 p.m. and 5 noon on Wednesday.

In the United States, more than 20% of air passengers take banned items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly exported prohibited objects to aircraft past the U.S. Traffic Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least 6% of passengers had knives or other blade-equipped objects that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said they only afterwards learned that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey and was implemented by the Stratos Jet Charters subscription airline, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers who deliberately broke the rules of the TSA were representatives of Generation Y and less than 15% belonged to generation X.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than 3% admitted that they consciously took blade-equipped objects to an airplane, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men said they consciously took banned drugs to an airplane.
The survey was attended by passengers from all over the United States, and the company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken smuggling goods past security and how many had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that the most travelers also most often take smuggling goods past security — knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the surveyed company states, TSA's instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what fluids to take to the plane and how much.
It is no surprise, then, that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while, there were also thought that books should not be taken on the plane.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not for international flights.
US Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt fainted his decision to delay Obama's decisions to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states had sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA, Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during Obama's reign to reduce emissions to reduce the emissions of the smog.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency led by him takes greater account of the needs of the state environmental decision makers.
Pruitt did not mention a word of the action brought against his previous decision in the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should begin to comply with the 2015 ground ozone standard as of 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he will move the implementation of decisions one year ahead so that his agency has more time to familiarize themselves with the plan because the agency "does not want to intervene in local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was an Oklahoma state prosecutor before President Donald Trump appointed him the leader of the EPA, and Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden mental change is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a decision that the EPA leader exceeded his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which ordered companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Pruitt claimed that his turnaround on ozone regulations only strengthens EPA cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements according to schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it, which will reach an agreement on schedules," Pruitt said, in his previous action, sued the Environmental Agency more than ten times.
"We do not believe in regulation through trials and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it has conferred on us."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt could continue to exercise its "power to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a wider change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA's trial this week, said the group was going to continue pressure.
"The EPA's mental change as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of the smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is generated when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical factories, for example, respond to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The smog thus generated can cause serious breathing problems for sensitized groups of people, which is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make a guy responsible for our breathing air use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other groups of self-interest."
Supercar manufacturer becoming a SUV - "appears in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to stick to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents their new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of measles in East Savo of the same type of virus
The measles infection in the beachsalmi is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo, THL reports.
The National Institute for Health and Welfare Virology laboratory has ensured on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is the same strain as previous infections.
THL has ensured that measles infection confirmed by a beach salmelian person on Friday 28 July is the same type of virus as previous cases in East Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in eastern Savo are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good because that means we haven't come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth sick may come up until mid-August, and the epidemic is therefore not yet over, says Mirkalena Erkkilä, a physician responsible for infectious diseases in primary health care.
No new measles infections or doubts have emerged since the fifth confirmed incident.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-dateness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä recalls.

Finland prepares for a promising scream
Pontika soup was not even considered to be legalized.
The underlying argument that the process produces methanol along with liquor, which is toxic.
Making a shield at home is legal next year, but legalizing the pontika soup is not even considered.
The shield is made by fermentation, the pontika again by distillation.
Behind the regulation of distillation is the basis that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
There has been no political will to enact the pontika soup as a right of every man," said Ismo Tuominen, Government Counsellor at the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the Alcohol Act, pontika distillation was not considered to be legalized.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation," says Outi Mäkelä (c.) by MP.
He is in a group of negotiations between the parliamentary groups of government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permission to distill at the pontika's home cannot even be granted on application.
Commercial manufacturing remains subject to authorisation.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for the home preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be prepared by visiting home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can make a legally scream at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavors and aromas and allows the manufacture of the scream, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation still needs to happen so that the raw materials or the flavor and flavouring materials created during their fermentation are clearly noticeable in the drink.
Under the new law, you can prepare as much drinks as you want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It must still not be put on sale.
The fight is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now for review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be processed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to heart attack suspicions.
Pistorius has already been out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered breast pain, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesman confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for investigations.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family, on the other hand, said that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-fold Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Stenkamp was shot by Pistorius in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The literies of US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to end his public speech not to pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States called Nieto for having knocked out the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also released a literation of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and there was a tense exchange of words during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia must be "laughs", "sulky" and "stupid." Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on colonization of refugees in the United States.
Trump dropped the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia massacre: Activists set up racist lynching in hope of justice
The Ford Mercury branded car bypasses a crowd in Monroe's small town in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
The car has four black passengers and a white driver, and four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The team leader, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath of his cigar and bricks through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man snaps.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-launch that aired on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the hanging loop is threaded around the neck of "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reshape the events of 1946. At that time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for the murders.
"It's confusing that no one has been arrested during these years — even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the arrangements for re-launch.
"It is a disgrace of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian congressman.
For him, re-launch is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to be tried, and we want things to finally be finished, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives for lynching have been known to the locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, Georgian state blacks were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election, and the Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
The FBI said an incident occurred at the time of the election, in which black rental farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently touched Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child for her.
According to FBI reports, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged for the murders," the FBI report said.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks puts it more concisely.
"It was a suffrage murder," he says.
"They were murdered because black people wanted to signal that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-launch of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating, a description of the shocking racism that many would like to believe have already disappeared from today's United States.
It is difficult to watch the show but even harder not to look at what Greene says is to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark side," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've been through."
On the first day of this year's performance, about 30 actors — a dozen black and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been re-launching the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years, but the role is always equally difficult and repulsive.
"You feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this side of history is also displayed so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are practiced.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said leave my land, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then the punch leaves.
And then all (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the toughest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too fast?" he asks.
"No," Greene is throwing.
"I just don't think whites used the word n--u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the show is unpleasant, but the room is taken over by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, and they want to respect the memory of those killed.
The scene begins over.
Now Rascona's words are mocking.
Nobody laughs.
The restage ends quickly and violently.
Scream, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks with every other word.
A few ten meters away, fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost exactly half of the audience is black and half are white.
There are a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York State, but most are local.
They have been on Brooks' guidance on the victims' graves in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have become true from the story, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song performance, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to look at artificial blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters like to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who played the thrillers take off their cloaks and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman involved in the show comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors gather for dinner together.
A white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the performance with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski has a hard time finding words when she describes the feelings that the performance evokes.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and watch the terrible things they say and do people who look the same as you — just because they look like you," he says.
"I made me find that lynchings are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's performance.
"Reset is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it is also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Vegetable ration in stores stirs up: This is what the removal of "extra parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
What about taking off a big hat part from the pineapple, it weighs no matter how much?
The answers share opinions strongly: for one, it is an indication of the sneeze that is taken to the extreme, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that do not use and who still go to the trash at home.
This phenomenon is identified in stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetable department of Ruoholahti in Helsinki, because many tear the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to the biowaste of the store.
According to news published by financial messages, snooping on a vegetable counter is a wonder for traders.
But how much does removing extra parts of vegetables before weighing really save money?
How significant is the numbness really?
We Women tested how the price changes when you take off the leaves or strains from pineapple, latva artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The price of cauliflower cost 2.10 euros was 1.80 euros when it peels all the leaves off.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple paying €2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 when its position twisted away.
Latva artichoke: The price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short position was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without positions, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and strains go to pluck off, you save a few dozen cents at best for one vegetable.
As percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
So these purchases would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of 222 million euros.
The huge €222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League braked the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first payment attempt.
Under the rules of the league, the club buying cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his or her own contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be presented to a new home audience at the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA examines details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide the payment to the European Football Association UEFA so that the union can determine any disciplinary action that may result from the case.
Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, has suspected that PSG is breaking UEFA's financial fair play rules with his spending.
UEFA can punish a club that makes a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its financial clauses.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts, UEFA was announced.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned qatarian company.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing regular work measures on the plane at Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of coworkers when suddenly lightning struck a plane from a rainy sky.
The power of lightning threw the plane into the land of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that his brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if she was alive," Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a morbid.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain hemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
You can't wait for that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the transport company itself decides whether to follow it.
Pearson reduces 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting
Pearson, the British training group, announced Friday that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut dividend by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that he would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third austerity program, which aims to revive weakened business as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell his share of the Penguin Random House to his partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for this year unchanged. Its net sales increased by one percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and officials said a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others were wounded.
NATO said five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the Qarabagh attack in Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the Thursday evening explosion occurred when a joint patrol by NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by a "self-made explosive device" by a person.
The statement reported that all injured persons were stable and treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Corresponders say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are significant concerns about NATO forces near Bagram.
The UN said at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of whom were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, where there are mainly Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said he was behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people died in downtown Kabul in a bombing, the country's most devastating militant faction attack after US-led forces overthrown the Taliban in 2001.
Violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses its decision to postpone the implementation of smog regulations
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fainted its decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during Obama's reign to reduce emissions that reduce the smog-induced emissions one day after 15 states had sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the so-called "otson compositions" for 2015 late Wednesday, and the agency said the decision was a testament to its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions by one year for October 2018. According to the definitions, the smove rate is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution must be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, and they said it was illegal to postpone enforcement.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate the environmental regulations during Barack Obama, and Trump said the measures are part of a broader economic growth program.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leader in ISIS, had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Doubts said the bomb was scheduled to be taken on board on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police are not telling us more about why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device that secretes toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes decreased, but struck the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will be able to complete the strategic investments we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 pounds, met Thursday for the first time.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN sports channel premises in Los Angeles until WBC's invincible lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked along the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper feather series champion.
Garcia won on Saturday on Showtime by unanimous decision of former four printing world champions Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the comparative list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How you doing, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on seven Saturday.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between the men would be "perfect in terms of size".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved the series above [63.5 pounds] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight series.
He's got to get up in the light series [61.2 pounds], then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the match should be held on the payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in the lightweight series later this year and will fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight series Forum on September 23.
"The interview could be on the payment channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else is attracting as much attention.
I'm fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredable fighter" and he might plan to go see Saturday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted the praise for Garcia's fjord and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he was first focused on showing the impact force and then boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them is to be realized more and more strongly.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great fight."
Average salary of 5,300 euros, education that happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Last time, Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the banker's investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and various sales of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The reductions are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define competence requirements.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees to a company called APV Investment Degrees Ltd, whose degree working group sits experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry actors.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV investment degrees Oy, says that the pass percentage of exams is roughly 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, roughly all investment services have completed either an APV1 or APV2 degree because they are mandatory according to the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have avoided completing the degrees, Savikko says.
He said there are "a few" such bankers.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people and approximately 3,000 people recommended APV2 degrees for investment advisors since 2000.
Some bankers consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
More than one other industry has much stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is then that is where competence related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros in average per month including commissions, fringe benefits and performance fees.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly wages are approximately 5,300 euros.
Men working in the tasks earn over 5,900 euros on average per month and women, respectively, over 4,500 euros.
The tithe of those who earn most earns an average of around 8,100 euros.
The tenth of men making the most earns more than 9,000 euros per month or more, one tenth of the women making the most earns 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Up to now, self-regulation has been trusted at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, the audit it carried out received individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the advice's activities.
In principle, investment products can also act as a seller, even if professionalism and qualifications are at a heavy level.
In principle, the situation has been wild and free in this regard.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each undertaking is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, is likely to be given the power to determine what to know.
Fiva's market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the current is the legislation on the requirements for the competence and experience of investment advisors and investment product sellers.
According to the court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is likely to be empowered to order knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided during the coming autumn.
The company must also take care of the necessary training and, if necessary, monitoring and continuing education.
All of this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to display that this has also been the case.
The court specifies that in practice, the company must, for example, map out the staff's job descriptions at an individual level.
This will certainly be different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or sales of products.
According to the court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone who has experienced a deadline if the knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain time.
According to the change, the rules will become more intense and concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drawn" on top of a giant aircraft in the United States
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in Flightradar24 service.
The flight was conducted on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner aircraft to test the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
A plane leaving Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 km in 18 hours and 1 minutes, which is longer than any permanent commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within the borders of the United States throughout the journey.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming school doesn't get a rain or a toast of the sun - Iines Kaikkonen pushed persistently with the help of a swimming pot village
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools will run in Slette and Lempuka this and next week.
Although it rains sometimes and then it shines again, the young swimmers are not a mox, the leader of swimming schools, praises Taina Itkonen.
This week's swimming schools will increase a total of 13 children, a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and eskari are already starting at that time, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation by the Sports Association project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere on the Liette beach.
The sun was shining and young swimming schoolchildren trained to stay on with swimming tables, someone even without.
The water also enjoyed smaller siblings.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first thought deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to push towards the beach.
You're doing great!
Iines Kaikkonen said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the sludge beach is good.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming was persistently engaged in swimming with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too get to be happy with today's achievements, the swimsuit praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again wanted for water wars sometimes.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, who followed swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learn swimming.
Even though the weather has been what happens, Anna has loved to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swimming schoolchildren packed on the pier.
The boys had enough activities with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the pier, snapped fruit, and basked for the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no rush on the pier.
That's not part of the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's such a unifying story"
You can see all kinds of it.
A couple of days ago, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product series.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks, as well as a "wc brush with a border brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film in these autumn.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been found on social media: When do you get Unknown Health Ties?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Blue Product?
We are the partner of the film.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Määttä.
He says that the products will be a special introduction to the stores, and the film thus gains visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories attached to them would have something in common?
Yes, this is a common story that we are a Finnish player and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
He said the company supports his same Finnish core values, supported by those who have seen by the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other business partners in Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saluto, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall vichyt has been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products were already perata Suomen Kuvalehti's blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are already available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film to premiere, so there is still a continuation.
The unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, for example Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers age tests announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of the asylum seeker more closely than before, and the new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for its failure to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests so far, and the forensic agency has now released the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and late July 2017.
80% of those tested, or 2002, an asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age, and in addition, in 25 cases that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under 18".
Tests were only conducted in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson's forensic agency says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are quite consistent, and there are no big differences in statistics in previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of the 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "references that the subject was 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joint. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, the endocrinologist of the Karolinic Institute, whose work includes an assessment of the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can determine whether a person has had puberty earlier than usual or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right way.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "Generally, it can be said that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old, and then the risk is about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 sections with a result strip down in the golf European tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left place 11 on Saturday, but was found to divide 41 at the end of the tour.
Ilonen was accompanied by three bogs in a difficult weather.
Others were having a difficult time, too.
Ian Poulter, an Englishman, rose to share the top spot in one under the par tour, although he told me that there was enough work to hold the umbrella.
The weather was raw, but I hung with me and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top place with his compatriots Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor to Change Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at the Trump campaign event that he would change parties.
"Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection... Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience burst into fresh applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His property is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) published a statement Thursday night that "the party change of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party with no leadership whatsoever and cannot find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Flashes sow damage - Thursday becoming even summer's very thunder day
More thunders will also be available in southern Finland at the end of the week.
Over the past week, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be a very thunder day of summer so far.
Thunder showers have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, it has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the Southwest Finland region.
At the dust, lightning struck the power center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue services received a notification of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in the sauna space at the end of a terraced house.
The rescue department dismantled the roof and wall to find fireboxes and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
At the edge, lightning lit the outbuilding in flames on Harjullantie before midnight.
When the rescue services arrived, the building was already at a full stage of the fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the spread of the fire.
An outbuilding of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio, lightning struck a detached house.
The people of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashy lightning strike.
The rescue services visited the scene to check the incident, but this time lightning did not produce a fire - only a few fuses escalated.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the defect was received on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which trains were replaced by buses in the meantime.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before five afternoon.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the run-off section of thunder.
Lightnings have sown destruction across Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively low this summer.
These thunder stuff this summer have been completely dead! estimates meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Wednesday and Thursday's thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the little lightning balance of summer, it also feels strong for many.
This might seem like a really hard thunder, but that's what it's been compared to this summer's thunder, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, land lightning blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential for even the toughest thunder day of summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 land salamis in the plaque.
If lightning continues to the early evening, then more than two thousand lightning can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record weak thunder year was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning volume had risen to 18,386.
So there is still something to pay so that this year does not break the "record" two years ago.
However, the old schooler can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a birth environment acceptable to thunders.
The main focus of the elderly is likely to move from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturday and Sunday.
A more united rain front is expected to be in the middle of the country.
In such things, Tuovinen says it's only a few.
Coe praises Russia's "open" apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the world's athletics boss, praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made on Thursday due to the doping scandal. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to stop Russia's ban on participation.
Russian athletics leader Dmitri Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup on Thursday that the ban on Russia is appropriate and that he intends to fight doping with determination.
He said he was sorry for "for all the athletes who took a gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban, and Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-supported doping in Russia was presented in the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA report.
"I think his answer today was very direct, and it was a very open-minded motion," IAAF chairman Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything possible to reorganize its operations."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" by Russia accepting the conditions for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We will have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday, meeting the IAAF strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF working group, said Monday that Russia still has to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate, and the coaches who are banned from operating are still operating freely," he told reporters on Friday to the IAAF Council after his performance in London.
Production company disappointed by the weak success of Tom of Finland
Tom of Finland did not become the kind of success as the authors hoped for," says Yle.
If you say honestly, I am disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff Yle in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience may be conservative, and it seems that is what it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, compared to the film's budget, about five million euros, compared to a little.
There was no lottery win, but now it is important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams from foreign distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the economic rules of football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions restricting the spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player transfer ever.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced the financial rules for fair play in 2011, which states that PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club will move in tens of millions of dollars.
There are many economic aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG has no difficulty paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to his star guard, as it follows to fund Qatar's oil-enriched dynasty.
Clubs are allowed to spend large amounts on player acquisition, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The fair-game financial rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platinum, elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success in debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners drew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitor their losses.
The change meant that Roman Abramovich's first business model used in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases, and created a global brand.
The current three-year period of assessment of the fair-game financial rules will last until 2018. During it, the clubs are allowed to make a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave the tasks of UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will apply them in the future as well," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the financial rules for fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can amortised amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual period of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the fair game's financial rules, the first sanctions were distributed in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies related to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA does not calculate the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority for PSG was oversized.
It has also become apparent that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG might be funded by payments available from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, the PSG and the organizing committee have denied that Neymar would be making an ambassador to the World Cup, which would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to the previous sanctions by PSG, UEFA is monitoring companies in more detail than usual to circumvent the rules.
Sources from the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not revealed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last period's financial statements have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and game shirts.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly irritated by the world's best player's departure, tried to make Neymar move more difficult, allegedly breaking the economic rules of fair play.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish League chairman Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, who referred to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the government funding the activities of the football club. Arsenal is owned by the American sports yard.
"The case is the result of ownership that has completely changed the environment of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"Everything is possible after the government owns a football team.
Compliance with fair play financial rules becomes very difficult. There are so many interests related to the famous player representing the state."
Now I'm in a hurry: Finnish World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
Length jumper Arttu Pajulahti and trimeter Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump pruning and Mäkelä on Saturday in the three leap pruning.
However, the coach of the two, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter in the British major broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a documentary, but it has not been good enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what," said Jorma Kemppainen, Coaching Director.
He has always handled visa issues himself successfully, but now there are some problems.
He'll do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't have that big meaning.
As long as someone looks at the stadium with the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
World Cup medal for FinlandLondon requires a miracle
The World Athletics Championships will begin in London today on Friday and last a week ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether success or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is given to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one rank to another, where by acquiring experience, matures the athlete's performance to the level that the Adult World Cup Medal is truly possible.
Now the small World Cup team in Finland does not have such young athletes, or even veterans.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It pulls bench athletes to the television screen and glues to follow the games, even though the London medals are not solved until late evening due to the time difference.
Of the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Uskaliks are waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the other one is told by the recent results of him and other throwers and the stay of Pitkämäki in the qualifying last summer's rankings.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes in the games, access to the finals or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and believe in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the coming years will give a good success in the international awards for young people this summer as well.
Processing young talent and financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweat work from athletes and patience from training as well as bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the intimidation of terrorism or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is ranked second in a big air race in Colorado, United States.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson in the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried the Caballerial 1080 with his last jump for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeed.
I feel good and good is now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite.
I will try it again from now on, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship stuck to port in Helsinki
Viking's new express ship FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was a loading on board at eight countries.
The ship was already late in Helsinki.
At least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving a little, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian who is waiting to enter the ship in the port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical defect to the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles waiting for access to the ship in its cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund says to IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8:15 p.m.

Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story is simultaneously looking for both the days of character's glory and the 90s grunge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great series of The State sketch for MTV) and their own time — before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved to larger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant memoir we have stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to have lived in time.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (which, among other things, the backstory of a vegetable can speak with H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lustful teenagers approaching age, highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys, for example, 90s stalker movies, such as the horror film The Hand that is rocking.
In one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The kind-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot features Ronald Reagan (so Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (who is aptly played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best is side paths.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a beard follicle under the lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddin, played by Rudd, is starting to be an old man.
Moments of random madness may bring this series into flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series again appeals to a different nostalgia: The Americans' Cold War Spirit, Atomic Blonde, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas, made as a Romanian 1980s police drama, where a Bugarestian cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring Gregor and idealistic Iosef will be seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been duwned in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But it's not much more.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (policees spend time watching chess on television the same way Americans watch football).
There are a group of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in imitating clumsy socialist drama — for example, accompanied by a killer hidden behind the Reagan mask, which is why the series often really starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or abundant.
In summary, the series might work better as agitprop satir, for example when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. embassy and there are always two fat men devouring hamburgers in the lobby.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and their history as a turf.
Toni Tauru, Kouvola, will rise to the ring in Macau on Saturday, facing former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight up.
Toni Tauru receives a hard bone in Macau, as Leandro Issa, a Brazilian, still fought in the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of Jujutsu and the World Championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting an older person.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru says.
Kouvolalainen was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were received with a quick schedule for the Chinese self-government region Macau.
The Taurus has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying, as it took a lot of time to prepare and training.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time was brought to the struggle.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not improve in a week.
The condition can get worse if you practice too much now.
In its previous few battles, the Tauuru has faced opponents whose strengths are in erecting.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa of Kouvola describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he's coming on hard in the first round and trying to take him to the carpet.
He's won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he can wrestle.
The previous match in Kouvola did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially: he couldn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit my eye angle.
It was a shame for a really long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise more densely into the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three games last year.
Now the second struggle of this year is ahead.
Sometimes the pace has gotten pregnant.
In recent years, I have been training and been in good shape all along.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard of the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the joy of doing things back.
We got some really good training when we had one guy from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvolalainen will have to prepare for physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit rationally.
If there's a chance, I'm going to take the property myself.
Down exports should not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who fought in China before.
I hear it's Las Vegas in China.
I think there's a big and fine evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged once economic growth has been imputable and inflation has stopped speculation from interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the bank was shifting interest rates because of increasing pressure on family income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by 6 to 2 to keep interest at 0.25%, and this month the interest rate received less support because economic growth has been imputable.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank fell its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%, and also warned that there is even more pressure on household income levels, as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to three per cent in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-enhancing inflation, and the bank also announced that loan costs may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to cancel some of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost funding to banks 15 million more through the programme, or a total of 115 million.
The Bank's interest rate decision protocol states: "According to the forecast of the Financial Commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income reduces consumption."
As far as interest rates are concerned, the Bank reiterated that a "some degree of tightening monetary policy" market expectations is needed to curb inflation.
The market is currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases were "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5% to $1.31, which weakened by 0.4% compared to the euro and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates was made after lower than expected growth figures dampened increased expectations of interest rates, and GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope for households with accelerating inflation and scarce wage increases, and the bank says the situation will deteriorate even before it gets better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "can not prevent" income decline in the coming years, but it expects that wage developments will recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of a weak pound, which will reverse some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after the interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after the EU referendum result, which plunged the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to show prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, interest rates had become increasingly demanding as inflation tightened the pressure on households, and three decision-makers demanded a 0.5% interest rate increase in July.
Inflation eased 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation would tighten again in the coming months.
According to the bank, its 2% target level was due to a "whole" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be further tightening as lenders feverishly apply for customers and want to quit the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, Coreco Mortgage Brokers' director.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also no cost-free options available."
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed a "reverse" anti-HIV prophylaxis, and the Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the financing of the drug in the English public health care system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A drug taken before sexual intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in individuals of high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal held the Supreme Court's ruling last year, which states that the NHS is able to pay the PrEP drug, although it is claimed that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS in England, called the "significant new intervention" announced on Thursday, and the national AIDS organization described it as "solving for an important moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to start accepting enrollments for an experiment that will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine taken before sexual intercourse, which reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
You can take the drug daily or two hours before sex.
The target group of treatment includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender, and people with HIV positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
Clinics choose candidates who meet the conditions for the experiment from men, women and transgender, as well as those whose HIV positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in the treatment of a general practitioner can also apply for an experiment with their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of targeting, taking and implementing treatment.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV," says Stevens.
"It's yet another major achievement in the fight for solving one of humanity's greatest health challenges for more than 30 years."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those in need and at risk, it may have a turning effect on the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, those at risk will receive a drug through NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of a lot of people.
This was welcome news."
"Now the most important thing is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and no one at risk is excluded from it," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used for testing has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was prolonged in vain in several months due to government slowing down," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a turning effect on our work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, thus protecting those exposed to HIV and getting one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of living: interlayer and smart interior design solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who was enthusiastic about the renovation of real estate, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's era-style house, and the success of Remont is that Joanne has not yet packed her rig and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment screen and found that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved right away and made an offer the same day."
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where you could only get into the bedroom from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an interlayer to take advantage of the room height.
"I wanted space, large windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed design agency in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space of rooms nearly four metres high and creating an apartment that would not be just a renovation and sales destination but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an interlayer where it could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The textures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged on top of each other so that they do not have to crouch.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on and under them."
Erfan was able to place two full-high rooms on top of the space with fascinating details.
The interlayer opens a copper cross window of Retruvius to a stylish lounge.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the sense of space and light.
The mirrors at each end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than real.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirror-surfaced furniture of the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
Kitchens with folding door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It required a little design," Erfan says of a steel reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It's balanced, meaning it slides when lifting very easily."
With the design of reasonable space use and storage space, Joanne received 16 extra squares, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
"When selling the apartment, the area determines — or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"In the case, a real estate agent walks in the apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly created based on them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to the electrical wires on the walls.
They are important too, but not the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.

Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His due time is September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue dressed a princess nicely.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden, on a representative trip this week.
Sofia completed her living on a small bag.

He grows us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Market where Thai food was sold.
The Lahtins did not dare taste, but walked by.
The food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at that time.
Since the people didn't dare go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Bays to eat Thai food, spring roll at a time.
Taste of countries, he said.
I got hooked from the bay.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and places limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
Slowly we got to know each other better and became friends.
Eventually, I sat at the plate with the dictionary learning Thai language.
Two years went on the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to change because the spice pastes made themselves were said to smell too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the Market Hall.
There's room.
Now we juteers are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times we have to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows his client.
He's told the news where they've been visited and who was seen.
He knows what food each one eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food club changes.
He remembers what man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me when he was skinny and fat, and remembers what I was like when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door, and change the news with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
In addition to our sense of taste, he has opened our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him Thai - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Although he's had a hard time, he's always kind.
He's hardworking.
He goes to the restaurant job in a sponge and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day went by work.
Discovered on underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
In early the year, security officials got their hands on a significant list of anti-terrorism work.
The list contains information from over 170 ISIS fighters ready to attack Europe.
According to the German magazine Die Welt, there are 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people mentioned in the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They are from Belgium, Holland, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have become more accurate.
The newspaper said Iraqi military special forces found a list of terrorist personal data and images while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and sent them forward to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person's home country.
The list also specifies the specialties of terrorists.
For example, Sami J, a German 27-year-old on the list, says Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, first traveling to Egypt, then to Libya and later via Turkey to Syria to join the ISIS ranks.
A suicide bomber is written next to his picture.
There is no more accurate information about the fate of a man.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe, whose fate is not certain.
Man sinked under surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save the life of the drowning.
A person under water was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, firemaster of the Helsinki Rescue Department on duty, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescue department diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
Rescue services received a notification after half past four this afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency care.
Estlander says it was a man about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation between the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a mission led by the Border Guard.
Those present also guided divers excellently.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, says the firemaster on duty.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four a.m.
The crash occurred when another car turned from behind the warning triangle in front of another car, the firemaster on duty says.
According to the Rescue Department, there is a speed limit of 80 km per hour.
Brothers fight over $500 million for real estate assets
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate empire worth over $500 million, and the dispute is related to a family business founded by their Italian family 40 years ago.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Torah district just three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave a family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about one third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as "a family-rich power and central figure".
According to court documents, the asset distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was heard last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediation attempts.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin said the claim is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor care of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn testimony that he would like to reach a solution.
"In line with our Italian traditions, family is the most important to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of false statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first denim store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school while Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to his sons in amicably.
"Luigi often said he didn't want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two boys in the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, and Colin said Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million while leaving the company.
Paul says Luke and Mark are "the bitter of the financial conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, although it is a former member of the board of the Australian Football League Society and television star Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he told me in his text message that he could not really comment on the matter because it is being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to withdraw our family according to the name of our family to a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued and said he still hoped that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our deal will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Human Resources plans to limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally succeeds.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House Chief of Human Resources plans to limit President Trump's media use and news tracking so often the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with management staff on his first working day, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he plans to limit President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information — those who have been printed and heard at briefings — must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has decades of relationship with television — and as president he still watches a lot of television.
"If presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media were dealing with issues more equally," Sam Nunberg, an advisor to Trump's campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign workers, it is essential to manage Trump's Twitter use that her personal media flow includes a steady flow of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's Twitter use would never have been under control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't know — maybe Trump's tweets would have been even more fervent without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
The problem is partly because there are competing groups in the White House trying to drive their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on a case:
"Trump's current and former employees say he can become immensely enraged from newspaper clips that criticize him — especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, then he is absolutely forced to know where the data came from.
That was the case in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, founded by online provocator Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Staff Chief Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously filed false accusations and subsequently withdrawn them. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started reading the story to ask the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive himself and his assistants are still driving their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signed a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who played football in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of 222 million euros.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been dissolved, and was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The huge €222 million transfer amount is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was at Manchester United, which cost 105 million euros last summer for French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned qatarian company.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi from Qatar.
Neymar is believed to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcome alcoholism and fear of flight with hypnosis: "I'm in my life's condition"
From the TV series Rose Time and Pure White Sheets, known as successful writer Raija Oranen, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold Grandma so in addition to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now a rental apartment also left in the spring.
To the light and sun, out of the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The external essence is 20 pounds lighter.
Weight went to fall when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were anti-depressants.
I once got help with hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, a radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has also worked in the tourism industry, has been going together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That kind of queen of drama she has always been, finished her life from that, Jyrki laughs at her wife.
Oranen, who made a major career as a writer, remembers only the clean white sheets of the TV series that touched and moved the Lama Age Finland.
I finally finished the clothing industry as the company of the Fresh Family when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on the aircraft.
I was the daughter of the stitcher myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes was mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He thinks the plot and story of the series changed the Finns' attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active time as a writer, has many manuscripts in the work - ideas hundreds.
The circulars returned over the ditch to the "millionaire alley"
One of the wealthiest houseowners in Western Midlands are again on hair seines with persistent orbiters who managed to cross the well-needed ditch of the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The circulars park their twenty caravans near the street called the alley of millionaires in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that the municipality needed for a walk barrier, bringing children, horses and the army of vans with them.
The circulars managed to cross the passage barrier at a point left unprotected due to the path.
The enraged residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident says that the detourists came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had thrown passersby with stones.
"The municipality must be roughed to work because it seems completely incapable of solving the problem.
The circulars were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another native who remains anonymous, it is ridiculous that the detourists returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even laid a horse in a park grazed."
A spokesman for Solihull Municipality said the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for collecting evidence that as many locals as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for court proceedings."
Enraged people surrounded Portuguese crash machine
In Portugal, men who made a forced landing on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died yesterday as a result of the forced bill.
Two men who flew the plane can be charged with manslaughter.
The longest of it can be 16 years in prison in Portugal.
A small plane flying by men had to make a forced landing yesterday on the shore of Sao Joao da Capaica, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran to escape the descending plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was on the cell.
Immediately after, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, told Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
The people on the beach surrounded a small machine immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it, Celia Rocha Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured on the forced landing.
The Finnish star tragically lost his leg won the World Cup gold again: "Without an accident I would not be the world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated Finland's time early Wednesday morning in the World Cup gold banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
Greater Hamari also won the World Cup gold in the games.
In total, three World Championships have already accumulated.
Pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was treated, with a pretty good heart rate pulled, Greater Hamari reached by phone rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole paralumboarding has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are reduced, and there are many new skiers involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse coming from behind.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Greater Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count since he was young with his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get to the slope.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it is useless to ifss.
With those cards, which are shared, Greater Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to sign a serious accident and losing a limb into a stroke of happiness, and Greater Hamari doesn't do it.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to their advantage.
I would say that the situation turned to victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest board enthusiasm for 23-year-old Suur-Hamar was already fading.
The job towards the top did not start really until after the accident.
I trained young with friends, and we always were excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dim somewhat over time.
After the accident, I found myself in the X-Games start somehow.
I couldn't have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this was going to be a really long life if I stay here to embitter and mourn.
I decided to pull the overalls on the neck and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The calculator was very pleased with the wheelchair reeler Leo-Pekka Tähde's choice as an athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at the sports gala held in January.
According to Greater Hamar, Star victory is an important signal to the parasports industry.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely earned.
This will certainly open eyes to the parasports world as well.
When is it time to launch the athlete campaign of the year by double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar?
We'll see it then in due course.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Sour Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he craveted.
Next year, this is a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We will go for a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugee youth will not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe to return to their homeland permanently.
They say that the end of the war in Syria and leaving ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing a change to the Syrian conflict.
Burson-Marsteller, a communications agency chain, examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February to March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half are men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think they are returning to their home country and 4% could not say.
The study found that young people's decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of war to be the most influential factor in permanent return home, while the quarter believes that the most important thing would be ISIS leaving the country.
Only less than one tenth will make the most important factors affecting the decision to improve the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not resolve conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
A quarter keeps al-Assad's presidency an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the conflict in Syria that is now underway.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS' power weakened over the past year, while the fifth feel its power has strengthened.
Respondents say the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and in general, terrorism is that the media would convey to people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly as many raised military measures and education reform as a priority.
In the opinion of the 10th, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided into two as to whether Russia and Iran's participation has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the internet in order - the database he has developed is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example, Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB, a Espoo company, is developing the "fastest growing" open source database in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs nothing to users, and can be developed through the web by any employ programmer.
Google and Wikipedia, for example, are users of a Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With databases, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they utilize MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is the technology director of MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
A man who works remotely from beautiful ones contributes to ensuring that the internet is working smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, the software giant Oracle devoured Sun for 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle store took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they would leave.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company at this point that began developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired Sun's twenty best developers and thus made sure that the continuity of the code is secured with the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
The name just had to be changed.
A foundation was established to oversee the freedom of MariaDB's code development.
"During MYSQL, these confirmations were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO at MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company's key figures.
So much, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates to receive orders of EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to change databases, which can be a contract for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
From MySQL, switching to MariaDB is done in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating systems distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we're a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Among our customers are one of the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks, and even a few central banks," Paqvalé lists.
The database market is still prevalent by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players such as MariaDB are still negligible, though fast-growing sines.
In the database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, because most users do not pay anything from these software.
Research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open at that time or the transition would have at least started.
Large companies do not get new customers, because most will next select open source.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as in the past with a lower number of customers," Widenius ponders.
Because changing a closed database is arduous, most customer companies have obediently swallowed price increases.
"There are a lot of customers to whom it is really difficult to move, because their old applications and others are closed in the closed database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the size of the customers is coming to the full.
When license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received €25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now to hire more.
One reason for EIB funding was MariaDB's impact on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is upset how to waste money on closed health care systems in Finland, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does something that you cannot or can do.
In addition to another Finnish Finnish developer Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius, is one of the most famous open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this subject.
Italy is intensifying its attitude towards NGO rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue refugees in the Mediterranean on their ships that they must not continue to operate unless they commit to complying with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the newspaper La Stampa in Torino.
Minnit's warning came the day after the Italian authorities seized a German ship from Jugend Rettet, suspected of cooperating with human smugglers that promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which operated for just a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement published on social media.
"We can only assess the accusations once we have gathered all the information we need and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who regained the boats.
One such case is claimed to have occurred just a couple of kilometres from the Libyan coast, as evidenced by the prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and the enthusiasm for helping is considered a motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must involve an Italian police officer who oversees the activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it would consider the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue activities.
Among those who refuse to comply with the Code of Conduct are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, said that with the rescue efforts, the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that action to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that plans to continue discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees moving towards Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing his cohabiting partner Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case for prosecutor
The suspected crime occurred in the Kuttase of Enontekiö last December.
Police say a 36-year-old man in Czech was suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect would have fled to the terrain with two dogs after his act.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when he caught.
The case must be charged in less than a week.
The case may be discussed in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-haired Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The death of the actor was announced on Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for the role of magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and his veterinary role in the All-haired Friends television series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's popular series was filmed in a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter sentenced to prison for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered to have incited her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, performs 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, and her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed to the verdict and was allowed to wait for the application to be heard in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and creamy blouse, listened to his sentence with his hands crossed a crying look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking conditions that Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "life or maturity level, and not even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his act."
The prosecution read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement saying that "it won't take a day to mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can get through all this, and I try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain we will always carry."
Conrad's sister Camdy's Roy told the court that she's "persecution" the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding and not be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never ease," Camdyn said.
There seems to be a precedent for the incident, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had incited his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Shut yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommate in Italy in 2007, released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox poll stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the poor Congress between the countries, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
BMW's director said the company believes that "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions." He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering limiting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would make changes to engines of over three million Mercedes to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to achieve CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installation of emission neutralising devices is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under strict surveillance, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of following major car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed scam equipment in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but leaders' actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head responsible for thermodynamics in Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emission requirements, based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi's investigation can significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote began fraud investigation, major demonstrations to be expected
The company said the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, president of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures the crisis will end
On Sunday, a Representative Council was elected in Venezuela, which is intended to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its change.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be underway at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, national security forces in the country began local time to take over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The troops are intended to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender had decreased due to drought and disease-bearing insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, with a clear reduction in rainfall in spring and especially autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence.
"This shortens the lavender's life.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cascals to the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are tough.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long spots and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing completely," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing watering, slowing down soil moisture evaporation and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water.
Murder of journalist embodies growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the once-week newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine deals with the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt authorities, and an endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, security is being discussed due to the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leave the children home or involve them in a delivery that was accompanied by a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.
They ask the journalists for names for each group, and no evidence is needed, observations and sensations are sufficient.
The board is written about the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make Mexican chaos life-threatening.
Violence is non-stop, and increasingly the attacks are journalists. According to the Suppliers' Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under the protection of the federal government. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration in Riodoku.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image in which Valdez shows the middle finger. The picture reads: "Right". Thirty journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned by Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a trademarked panama hat.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists discuss their joint trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor was established, especially for handling journalists' cases, but according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
Journalists' murderers are rarely tried, as are few of the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime each year.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about Sinaloa's violence, although they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting is little useful because the killers are unknown and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left Riodoku's delivery in Culiacan, the state capital, on 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks on his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away Valdez's car and crashed it some way away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn for a wife and two adult children.
Rumors move quickly and free in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is mouse slowly.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competing factions want to fill the vacuum.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death daily, and the cemetery has decorative two-storey tomb buildings of drug beards, larger than the households of many.
The coastal state has a "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty about not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival faction that is at war against the Guzman sons.
The case may have angered Guzman's boys: customers suspected of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to start Riodoce with five colleagues, and shares in the magazine were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to be known about its bold and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award of the Journalists' Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of Mexico's drug trafficking without ceasingly.
He openly admitted to fear.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Journalists' Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "life lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"The deliverer must accept the task that falls for him — or act as a fool.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce staff needs Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always got a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always used a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were fatal to him.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how they can best do their job and stay alive.
"Criminants don't like it if we deal with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trade runways.
They were excluded from the cases," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trusting one's own instincts.
If you feel like everything's not right, you have to stay away.
The problem is Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal said that "the impression can fail, and that's what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies, and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce's safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some of the journalists were half joking about whether it was the two police officers among the 50% that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
This week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main things.
Boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother had been killed in Sinaloa.
The magazine also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the names of a politician of the ruling institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governors belonging to it have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they would receive reliable information about the kidnapping from the Valdez column.
"Previously we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim physique, Ohukainen.
"Now all connections to our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse that preserves signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The employees of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists who promote press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with him the next morning when he left front of the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration due to another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on DNA tests by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder throughout the country, and "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, leader Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they tell the truth.
He has since asked him to be removed from cases on the government because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, crime-reducing authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his final book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the orders of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Articulo 19 monitoring team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body had a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my writings."
Next to his cut off his head was the computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the papers have decided to close operations, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on his front page, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals searched the journalist's hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — who was once to become a poet — admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on his way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce journalists sat on Friday at midnight on the sidewalk on the sidewalk after the magazine's latest number was completed. Suddenly, their phones began to color as a message.
19 people had died in the shooting between competing gangs and security forces at the Mazatlan beach resort.
The war accelerated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists put the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be re-submitted the next day.
Sirens howling nearby — another shooting.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoce's editorial continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider ending operations. "How could I close the paper when our intern asked us to get to the street to do the case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, Hannu Manninen, who was 39 years old, was short, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
It started a long period of illness that stretched to nearly five weeks.
May went practically completely when I was sick.
First there was a flu and finally, a pediatrician as ear infection that I had to eat an antibiotic course.
I was only able to do ten percent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the training enthusiasm, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion was not granted a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU roll mat test of the Competition and Top Sports Research Centre on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertips with a needle.
Last fall I was on the carpet for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fired the wall, Manninen says.
In a better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says she remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises with which I have tried to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now it's a really good five-week episode.
Midsummer was also a week and a half from the flight business.
I and my family also have time to go to the cabin.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition when Manninen rose to 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first snow games, Ruka would have a three World Cup weekend.
In December, it would be planned to be part of at least one weekend in the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would be still in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name can be found on the Olympic team list," Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth Winter Olympics for his career.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, the Nummela underline celebrated in Salt Lake City in the 2002 gold team competition.
Dinosaur protected from his enemies by camouflage
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miners that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its scaled skin was reddish brown and had had a "problemous past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best representatives of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the chalk season 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to National Geographic, armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Museum.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a boulder of 1,100 kg.
The results of the hard work are now available.
"If you squine your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will go into the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha's studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a major threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red and white armor disguised it from predators, and was also protected by darker and lighter coloring from below, which still occurs on many animals.
Experts say it was thus better able to mix with its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have named it from Borealope, according to Mark Mitchell, a museum technician, and Mitchell was a team from which it took over 7,000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a general coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on the top and lighter from below.
The observation was still a surprise because Borealope is significantly larger than current animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed it to the extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of the current animals, for example, deer, zepros and armadillas have similar coloring, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier catches, suggesting that nodosaurush was seriously threatened.
"The prey of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the chalk season dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds of nodosaurus scales reveals that its leather was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into the river when it died and drifted to the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was as warm as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go far beyond today.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its scale leather has survived and has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early chalk season
It doesn't take much imagination to perceive: if you squint a little eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The union period was an era of theropodes, the vast two-legged dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years earlier, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
For example, Tyrannosaurus rex was preceded by the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, which believe that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummyd into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from muzzle to the hip.
Nodosaurus averaged five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two half-meter spikes rose from their stages.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the current Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has survived to small details in the underwater tomb.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains on the frosted plates of the armor along its skull.
Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as a lottery win.
The more accurately you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The frosted plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on its footbed."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb apartment on the bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old young person, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweetings from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis, who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone off, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police closing tapes and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, whose sign he read, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where police stood in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also said he saw a video in which another police officer tuned his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers that he said.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years has been the documentary "Who Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is the story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with a flower dress and a daughter dressed in a crown compatible with it, they re-examined "what it is to live black and under what conditions". They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how blacks have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of past events.
My daughter has a right to know it and grow up to it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living black. And he must know what we need to do to free ourselves, to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect him from blatant racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I would harm him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station, becoming a campground for activists as they were waiting for information on the case and finally learned that there would be no charge against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of minority nursing students. At that time, she focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, assistant director of the documentary at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell you" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was a suspicion, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell you what's happening, or do you want a story you can use?"
The suspicion was driven by the countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually whites who just wanted to benefit from its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan recently said in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism with death-sponsored prisoners.
Davis' involvement caused Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals, and the filming team followed the events in the years that followed the shooting of Brown.
"This is not a documentary in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how local people are played in the movie because I'm played the same way."
Folayan said the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was wanted to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community". However, Ferrell proved to be the most open to be described.
That's why the documentary features surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he said what it felt like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human description of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story times and re-enters the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shooting black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement up," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees, "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, including a lot of queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-purpose" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, though, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the point of cutting many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
Ferguson has been left by news crews long ago, but relations between the community and the police are still tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years left parole, convicted of blocking the freeway at the demonstration.
His description of the social political atmosphere of his home corners is short and concise: "Sex."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized in the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our obedience is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Appropriate resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has hung in the middle of the showroom of the face — white, black, and brown faces, between which you can perceive resemblance in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leavenworth prison, where he completed his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transwoman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentenced Barack Obama on the third last day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though slightly theoretical statement on the customity of DNA data, ambiguity, and the underlying causal relationships and identity of the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that he identified with women since puberty. He was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage violation, computer fraud, and theft.
Manning, convicted of prison, had only one picture: a granular, black and white selfie, where Manning, who is uncomfortable, sitting in the car in the driver's seat. He has a platinum whale wig on his head, which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, and he received DNA data on cigarette butts, for example, and created pictures of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a new exhibition at a news conference.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be filmed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondents, writing each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future where the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven tough years in a civil prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now that Donald Trump is waging his own war against data leakers and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways to strengthen the powerful divides he was actually supposed to mitigate on Twitter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
There is an artist's statement on the wall of the gallery and under it Manning's large autograph, where the last name i is the point of the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA episode: a long line of letters C, G and A written on a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotide, such as the artist, the scientific definition used by the artist — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we are all, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition helps people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and there's 30 of them on display here."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, with a megaphone in his hand.
"If they can silence you, they've won," the picture says.
"Never keep quiet."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," an artist from Philadelphia says.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning comes along, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the showroom.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA episode is written with a pencil for height, which is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
"The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film Chelsea's mass movement, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee are sought as suspected of murder
Police say they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County Court documents show that arrest warrants were issued on Monday from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death. Arrest orders have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released against bail.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27, 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with several incision wounds in their bodies.
Authorities say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder, and police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice principal responsible for social relations at the university, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal issue that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University helps with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by an email from a university and Somerville College spokesperson states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities investigating the case in every way possible."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Chicago Police Department Information Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he urged suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly checking our search," Guglielmi said.
Guglielm said local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
He said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the sight as terrible at the scene.
Guglielm said it is unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Team published the following announcement for residents: "The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of aggravated harassment, among other things.
Police said they were alerted by the bookstore staff on May 23.
The staff said the man had "damaged to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for threats.
The threat was not related to the events of the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as a suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesman said.
I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told the police at interrogations.
As punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid social service and pay a legal cost of £620, or about 690 euros, and compensation of £85, or about 95 euros, to victims.
Scotland Yard's spokesman said several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will complete the actions under the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the actions under the WADA roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been taken, and the RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the British Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in these respects," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers.
But it says it does not contain anything worrying about Russia.
"Everything is announced, and everything is carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly accept the results of a study by WADA, a Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the state's alleged role in doping Russian sport.
Mutko said, "The investigation is underway because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we cannot admit something that did not exist."
Mutko's words had echoes of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission in Russia.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, who spoke to Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping organs. "We have said several times that there are controversial statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, it was authorised last June to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organization was "right on the road" towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation for Finns: There is no evidence" of health benefits for maternity packaging
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packaging.
The BBC and Guardian say that the Lullaby Trust, who fights SIDS, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packs distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package reduces the risk of SIDS.
Hidden death means the unexplained sudden death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in the UK health authorities in the child's safe sleep.
We no longer allow our official brochures to them because it would suggest that we recommend this product," the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, only two dead per 1,000 born.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of a variety of reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, that cannot be said for sure," said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland free for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of supplies, such as children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard as a place to sleep for cardboard boxes.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no cradle or cot available.
The organization recommends using the packaging for naps only and stop using it at the time the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the package and to make sure it doesn't get wet or dirty.
Vikkelä villain ran away from the Japanese zoo for the second time
Japanese zoo staff are looking for a escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told me.
The 35-year-old villain is female, 55 kg and about one meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is free to travel in the area of the shelter.
The zoo has not received eyewitness observations of the turtle.
The previous run-up of the villain occurred the week before.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups help your business avoid Uber mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her online store startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured us that the surveys were anonymous, some workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside aid.
More and more new types of human resource management startups have entered the market, helping other companies find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target certain teams and population groups, and provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, direct contact past management to the board.
"You can follow your own health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is companies Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained an even deeper view of his employees' thoughts and feelings.
The program can be used to conduct quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can draw up a map that shows at a glance at which departments the employees are most dissatisfied and which of the leaders have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Errett may have drilled to the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they must follow the workplace culture so that they do not become the next Uber. The transport company has been stirred up since a former employee wrote on a culture in their blog, where employees are harassed and people talking about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments website, can reach over $18.7 billion by 2020.
Convertent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
Convertent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
It also recently signed with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to do customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect a manager about negligence, the complaints go directly to the company's board.
"The general opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convertent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and are easily connected to the headquarters.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out the phone number or email address to make a notification to the headquarters. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Legal Director at Ruby Tuesday, who said that complaints made by the employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated faster.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related trials."
Quinlan said companies began to be more serious about ethics, values and employee engagement after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activities in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies understood that they could no longer prevent public clearance of their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came to control ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convertent provide their software as a service, the use of which is charged regularly.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convertent have venture capitalists to support it.
Convertent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies show that employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
"Employers are more strongly committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn, LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors get returns when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in the workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of a change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Russell Raath, Director General of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies have too much confidence in collecting information alone.
"If the company doesn't take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
And does their opinions matter?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts staff surveys monthly and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and provide communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term staff permanence in the industry known for the high turnover of employees.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it will lose customers as well.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of concealing their naked female neighbor, TT reports.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home after she noticed her window outside the cell phone hanging at the end of the string.
The woman says the cell phone camera filmed in the apartment.
The woman scared of the case had run to another room to dress.
After the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon then re-entered the window.
A 20-year-old man suspected of decryption has admitted to filming a woman.
However, he claimed to have only described a woman's face.
The video shot on the cell phone had been removed and police had failed to recover it as evidence.
In interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but denied committing a crime.
The man had justified his filming by saying that he loves his neighbor "just crazy."
According to the news agency TT, a man will be charged with the incident.
Teachers demand more money in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but should be narrowed," OAJ chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cut of public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into contracts that would not have some holiday money cuts involved in the review.
In the municipal sector, contracts should only be reached after private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that the terms of employment of OAJ, for example, have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals were not yet revealed by Luukkainen.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public trained conference organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday money surgery increases differences in earnings development
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, a fixed-term holiday money cut further steepens the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be defined how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who are best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
Bruins players' day was prolonged when NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have stayed to talk to the other side of the new training fields on campus.
Some have stripped their jerseys, their backs shiny from sweat after the first day of the training camp toil.
For many of them, this few minutes of chat is a midday break.
Players studying in summer courses at the university return to the dorm after three hours of training to read the final exams. The next morning they gather from half past seven to the Wasserman football center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changed Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one, with the aim of reducing the number of players' work, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final final exams are held.
That's why the first three exercises of UCLA started at 15 minutes in the evening, and it was difficult to find space in the players' full schedules anyway.
Limiting training sessions to one day means there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier than last year this year, and this is the first time in the Westwood coach season that continued through Mora six, when the exercises are held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season begins: UCLA will meet Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, although it made players' schedules even stricter.
"We load them a lot for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are willing to work, they're great friends.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outsiders after camp. It is not easy given the direct view of the training fields to the adjacent parking area and the Luskin Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed with footballs flying over the grid behind the goal pole.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and shoot exercises for video there. It is not an exaggerated concern.
A lot is paid for the video shot from the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head on it too much.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda
Presidential elections will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially aims for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for crushing the opposition and limiting the word freedom.
He has also been accused of distorting poverty statistics, for example.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to pursue because the constitution, which was limited to the two seasons of presidency, was amended.
However, in Rwanda, Kagame is also a truly considered leader.
In his time, social reforms have been made in Rwanda and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the land divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised its people more freedom since the land is raised on its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up the verification of facts
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to independent facts inspectors and present the results below the original article.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fax inspectors and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the largest distributors of fake news, and many people think that fake news affected the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has emerged in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombed with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the verification of facts will be tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass independent inspectors. They also want more background information so they can decide more enlightened what they read and share," Sara Su, Facebook's news feed product manager, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook continues to test the Related Articles function and makes other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now this castle, in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop hair writer fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says cataractist.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first archive-based book. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, whose inspiration was documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent who worked for the Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Arts Council, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle a little longer than he had hoped for without delay.
He spent the days studying Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles of centuries in the moat.
He was circling on the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest guards, gardeners, and sometimes artists who illustrated the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is quite unknown, as the castle was not completely transferred to the National Trust Foundation after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation staff were just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that archives had been held for hundreds of years using the same method: by taking everything extra to the attic.
There were diaries in the archives, letters from the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, here families fought even one birch.
I thought it would be allowed to be already."
Some of the stories in the book advance from castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joins the peasant revolt of England shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of a priest hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have framed his own funeral with stones filled the coffin (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The family's men seem to have been quite a little bit of carbs. They were constantly on debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The Darrell family men solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who could court the heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life's Hill, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, from which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
Relations with Russia the worst since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has deteriorated clearly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could work towards close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO is still committed to doing so that tensions would not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and the new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia had even reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the poor Congress between the countries, which passed new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko to quit - rematch against Anthony Joshua will not come true
Vladimir Klitshko, long-time heavyweight world champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who hit gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times, winning 64 of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000 and 02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury scored him in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild match in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in Las Vegas in November.
However, Klitshko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitshko's reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to terminate was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision," Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, a daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup of various unions at the same time.
The Finnish weatherbreaker is picking up conditions: "Export the vibe"
Seiva jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken the woman out of the vibe.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Cup in London.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer against Minna Nikka.
I wouldn't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I couldn't even get small stakes to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here, who knows how many times and I have never experienced such varying winds in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises," Nikkanen said in Kaleva's Games.
The weather was also spoken in London on Thursday.
It's been quite challenging to get the technique together - whether it's cold-nommed or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
Thanks to his hall jump 455, he reached the World Cup.
It's been 445 outside.
The condition is not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be moderate and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday's qualifying.
Why don't you move on working abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany in the early part.
I got a jump together and the technology standardized.
I think I should have done the same now.
Normally, you have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
25 degrees warm.
A small wind will go as long as it is constant.
An experienced ex-official rude politicians at Yle: "We don't have any division now or for many years"
Despite the positive atmosphere of the economy, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice in the hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades, warns the budget.
He says there is no division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed a retired Virta in Wednesday's First Morning.
Construction of next year's budget is just beginning.
Recently, punitive politicians' proposals for raising a guarantee pension, calculating car tax and supporting electric bikes, Virtanen considers election speeches.
They mainly say that elections are starting to be close because when 10% of the state budget is funded by additional debt, we have no allocation now or for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about the division when debt is taken," Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owes children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 as a Budget Secretary at the Ministry of Finance and then worked as Deputy Manager and Budget Manager of the Budget Department.
The last time he retired, he was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the projected 3% economic growth is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a spike from which we will be going down next year, and Finland is expected to grow one per cent for decades.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump said that the rules of the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, would be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain immigration and replaces the current program.
The new application process benefits applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
Danish Queen's spouse does not want to be buried as the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret shot in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and his wife Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, the Danish court says.
Traditionally, the pairs of rulers in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King Room has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral," the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lee Belleby, the court's communications manager, commented in the paper.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural result of not being treated as an equal footing with his spouse.
According to the court, the Queen has long been aware of the wish of her spouse's burial place and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: The car was to come on the freeway
Tom had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but do not receive money from insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash took place at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from Ring III construction site.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says his family had miraculously survived in a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportport in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From Ring III's exit to the Hämeenlinna bus, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was driving to the family car side, Tommi says.
Without the evasive movement, the car would have come with Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car ran into a railing at a fast pace.
The parents and the two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other under one year old.
Apparently, it was pretty good when nothing happened to us.
No one who passed even drove us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
The staff of the ambulance and rescue services arrived, and the family condition was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says he and the cohabiting partner have a small income, and they received relief from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family will not receive money for insurance.
That's why the family hopes for observations from eyewitnesses about the car, which is why the family drove into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the kindergarten and work without it," Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we'll have to count every cent today.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or know something about it will be connected to the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department are confirmed that they have had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday night.
The title and case corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, another car did not come to the lane of the people receiving, but had to drive from the acceleration lane to the family car side.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with relationships through humor - The Self-Representator will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings his first director to the What? Theatre.
The self-exhibiter is a musical theatre performance of relationships and inadequacy that went wrong.
According to Director Lotta Jäppinen, it still feels good.
The subject is addressed by means of humor.
You don't have a bad feeling, he says.
The touring summer theatre performance has been implemented with a picnic budget and a large, young heart, according to Jäppinen.
The name of the performance challenges you to consider what a person reveals about himself when he gets to know a new person.
Is he perhaps pulling a role or is the other jacket approaching open?
The plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
Jäppinen has both directed and dramatized the performance.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws from young people's thoughts, it speaks of all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Exhibitionist does not directly tell about his own or the relationships of the working group.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
My own world of values is certainly conveyed by the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but I also don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, is a prerequisite for happiness.
Many people learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist draws a current picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least the fact that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rauté and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes the dresser Ella Snellman.
The music adaptation is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying as a director of theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
There are two years in the back and another mokoma ahead.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The music classes have been an assistant to Kouvola Theatre and played at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
Guidance has become more and more interested.
The observer premiered last week on the Narri stage in Helsinki.
The performance, which lasts about 45 minutes, was also seen in the future, at least in the city of Jäppinen, Turku.
Exhibitionist at Kouvola's What? Theatre on 4 August at 7 p.m. and 5 August at 2 p.m. and 19.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered for a year from a terrible motocross accident - neckline broke
Few athletes in Finland have an unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtila.
The ace of the copper landing toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter for new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemist has not tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtila says.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahti had a motocross accident.
As a result, his neckline and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I licked wounds in my home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtila had bad luck.
He also admits that age could have played a part in the crash.
Driving a bike may sound wild.
But I didn't pick up boundaries with it.
It's just so hard as a sport that this is not worth doing too much!
After the accident, Lahtila was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long start as head coach of the Japanese freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the job immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching time, Lahti often challenged her protégé on the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't feel reasonable either.
Not even with the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because for once I just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtila as head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he would have burned out.
It's easier to find places in the body that's been broken than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach of the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace the fly species.
I switched motocrosss to frisbeegolf!
It left the shoulder right away.
At worst, I was throwing seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-inspiring trainer, he does not require his coaches to be the same as him.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
There is room in our sports culture to be their own and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots come and we should be worried
It's here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry — just as it started to feel like 2017 can no longer get weirder.
Yes, yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
"We need to start taking the proliferation of sex robots seriously," says Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being skied, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more," Sharkey said at the report's announcement.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and features created by artificial intelligence that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from eye color to the shape of nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, for example, shy.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, with a mood of story, or "in the mood."
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots, replacing genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resisting, for example.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot to vibrator on his website:
"Women have a vibrator, why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession in gender equality towards sexual interaction, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only start acting strangely or offensively when the market gives permission to do so.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become more common at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and a president sitting in the White House who has boasted of harassing women.
The Handmaid's Tale is not the most worrying about its powerful imagery, for example images of the hanged body and excavated eyes. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There are as many attempts to make sex robots like real women (by the proportions of porn stars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel genuine and the movements mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will or history of their own — nothing referring to independence or breaking the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist acts planned for Australia, group led ISIS chief
The head of ISIS, the extremist organization, led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to Etihad Airways' aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leader in ISIS, had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Doubts said the bomb was scheduled to be taken on board on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police are not telling us more about why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device that secretes toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, for example, public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continued.
Trump's good things?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a common sense
In Trump's term, it has already been repeated until boredom that the strong divide of voters has also broken up families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers' advisory boards guided how to get along with relatives who voted Trump.
We all want to puncture our information bubble.
Less attention has been given to Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been a button against our family Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousins all acquaintances — including a Republican-supporting sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it is a good thing, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we will talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to horrify his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrible chance that Trump normalizes the right extreme Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney's restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (and at least his tax return we've seen). Compared to Trump, they seem very mild violations.
When Trump's season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just has to be clear, and it immediately seems like a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to the Carousel of Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing you get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Karusell's horses are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and animals looking behind in horror — are ominous, and the underlying screaming music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's hallmarks become disappointments over time: views of tall buildings begin to get bored, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the reality of the city does not match dreams.
And I still haven't gotten over after 35 years that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-spirited pub, but it is not counted.
The carousel of the central park, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two 40-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week in a department store to evaluate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the cafe at my home corner, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to get coffee at the counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service representative to put their person in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store's salesman smiled as sorry when I was tired of giving five stars to the user experience of my credit card.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter - "There was no management confidence"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq's club's coach.
The responsibility for coaching is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who was previously a assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in its current tasks.
Piccareta, an Italian, has previously been an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching group, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, sorry for what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was no other option now," Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
He, together with the rest of the coaching team, is already responsible for tomorrow's home match against HIFK.
According to Ilta-Sanomat reports, the team has been sparkling throughout Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been set aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly clashed in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the '80s, would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hassles have been added to the picture, which allows you to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself wonders serious about a young woman looking at the camera.
Long ago, serious, he's communicating.
If the picture is not visible, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of her past and also spoke of painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a pair of pictures of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as a mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I've learned to like myself and how I look," Lampenius wrote.
After the text he had added to English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about her eating feuds from previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was eventually not revealed until 2006.
Healing slowly began.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which he received after falling in the cell, according to prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed to the original killing sentence.
He killed Stenkamp Valentine's Day in the early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to complain again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the appeal may be dealt with as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported the country's ministry, according to the BTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorizedly camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
The television channel bTV said the State Department later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already giving substantial fines to all who camp in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
Neste's share sinks - sunk already -7.7%
Neste's share has sunk by 7.7 percent at about 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes decreased, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
The stock exchange trade has started slightly on the frost side today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the opening of the stock exchanges, the extensive European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange General Index OMXH had fallen by 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points after approximately half an hour of trading and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that suffers from about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, head of the study, immune cells guard the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes that are hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome may result.
Experiments found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacterium in the intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to start developing immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the building ingredients of proteins.
"We found the connection between Lactobacillus reuter and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan in the diet of mice, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen bowel tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
In studying tolerance-strengthening immune cells, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was associated with the intestinal microbiome of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was studied, six species of bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were administered to mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They increased Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerance-strengthening cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mouse food, the number of cells that strengthen tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell to half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-strengthening cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuter bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "neron" in his ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United got a "neron" in his ranks after making a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted in Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last season of United in the previous game before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira as a defensive midfielder.
However, Matic was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved on the blue shirts Asian tour before the season began. He only did 45 minutes on the field — there must be a change before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and way of thinking make him a genius - he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'd help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were starting a game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting lineup for the beginning of the season.
This week, the Independent revealed that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he put first.
"Three out of four - we must give thanks to the club," he added.
"I'm happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women teased Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match in the World Cup Qualifying Tournament to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of gaming is high.
The game was steady in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third period Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we could rock along, Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, which collected 14 points.
Finland, who lost three out of four games, will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury already sends challenges in relation to Trump Jr. Russia meeting
In the United States, a major jury has sent challenges in relation to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The grand jury, convened by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges in relation to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer known for Kremlin connections Natalia Veselnitskaya.
This is reported by Reuters, which at the same time confirms the information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday about the convening of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges in relation to a meeting of Trump Jr. and the Kremlin connections, which took place in the middle of the United States presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, White House's current advisor Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington, D.C., means a closer pace of the Russian investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to help an investigation that seeks to investigate Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his immediate circle cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify on oath.
The great jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether the charges should be filed.
British inventor microchiped himself to get home and car with hand swing
The British inventor has been the first to microchip himself throughout the country so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and launch his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam thumb and index finger. Now he provides service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq company technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, consulting anesthetician hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets the medical requirements.
Microchip uses the same technique as microchips of cats and dogs, and it only takes 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also turns the locks of houses and cars compatible with a microchip.
Northam is married and has one child, putting microchip technology in both his home and the BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House show item cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the White House southern grass field for an event presenting American production came to cost taxpayers $24,000, as evidenced by military documents received by TIME.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on board. It was a attraction at an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017, where American construction programs were introduced.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials became acquainted with the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, there was a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift Mississippi.
The White House military office had asked the helicopter to the site by task-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern grass field for a "exceptional" event, as shown in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of this, because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an email to his superior, an assistant command of the Navy Flight.
The message reported that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field at 17 July seven in the morning and the event would begin at three in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave the scene until after the grass field would be emptied between six and nine in the evening.
The message also mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed due to service time restrictions.
The original crew was in a helicopter during the event, and the unit security personnel were by the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by TIME will not determine whether another crew was needed in the end.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event was breaking the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant command replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke in favour of health care reform at the time and looser state regulation at the time.
Using the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled up the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which introduced products made by American employees from all 50 states," said White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with centimeters of accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training bills for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly training quota for the crew.
The unit helicopters also flew 11 hours in "non-presidential support positions" that day.
The White House said the event did not entail any other expenses for taxpayers.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter presentation on the White House southern grass field.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter compensation level is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico base from Virginia State to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
The White House says the helicopter's operating costs are clearly lower.
"The calculation of the costs for taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The required level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND research company, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and thus employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defenses that many Americans have worked hard on.
It is entirely appropriate to raise it."
It's not certain if Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down in the seat of the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasan track - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical failure, says the Track Traffic Centre.
Trains will be replaced by buses for the time being.
The traffic control system failure was caused by thunder.
The railway centre did not yet have an estimate of the duration of the repair in the morning.
Venezuelan state prosecutor calls for justice to prevent the country's new Representative Council from being appointed
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court decision to prevent the appointment of the country's new Representative Council.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the Representative Council elected last Sunday's vote is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a Representative Council was elected to the country, which may, among other things, change the country's constitution.
Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision has been requested due to suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation on the vote.
He appointed two judges to the position after the British company that organized the Representative Council vote said that the results have been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro allies were nominated for the Representative Council, and the chosen 545-member Representative Council has, among other things, Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Representative Council may dissolve an opposition-led congress and change the laws.
Maduro was described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition considers the modification of the Constitution as Maduro as a way to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro claims that the new Representative Council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
They have wounded numerous people and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new Representative Council is scheduled to begin.
Russian man handed over by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court in the United States sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US claim.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland ceded Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, AFP reports.
In March this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had gained the benefit of millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after the prison sentence was completed.
The Russian Foreign Ministry strongly blamed Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be handed over to the United States.
The statement about Finland and the United States criticised the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
Prosecutors say Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used data by further directing internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, the head of the Department of Justice's criminal department, said the incident shows that the United States is also capable of chasing other cybercriminals.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.
Edited at 8:58 p.m.: Fixed the name of the convicted person.
Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel goes to the lead in Netflix hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the series will see the third and fourth seasons. The third season trailer has been announced and presents the new villains in the series.
In the third season, the US DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more bribery and violence from the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a comeback as Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola carries out an exceptional work of light art in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional work of light art in honor of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris on May 16 next year.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument outside it.
I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in cities of millions is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With my art, I can make the things I experience important to be concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about her work.
I am well taken from the invitation to be involved in the first international Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she illuminated UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the holiday.
I feel very privileged to re-establish my art at UNESCO headquarters," Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand really significantly.
We will announce this later during the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The International Day of Light aims to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fought at the shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a dispute in Espoo in the parking garage of the shopping centre Iso Omena on Wednesday morning.
The parties said the dispute began when one party accidentally drove into the prohibited direction of driving.
There was a word of mouth between drivers.
A driver who drove in the prohibited direction of driving would shone the driver of another car, resulting in his car moving, bumping into the driver's car.
He then hit the car that ran into the machine game.
In a preliminary statement, the man has admitted that he caused the damage and did wrong.
Written by Timo Soin under the question mark: "After that came the Flood"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post titled under the question mark on Thursday.
The article is short, only two sentences.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs' government party.
Then came the Flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soin's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the books of history have left the phrases "after us the Flood" or "the Flood after me".
UN says Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
Elections are only representative if they can vote for all members of society, including women, said the head of the UN Embassy in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the UN Relief Mission, said that hundreds of women are nominated in the provincial council elections, three women are seeking vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"You can't overemphasize the role of women," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election is the first time power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of registered voters are women.

Flood of certain tourists threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the target is only a few hours and rushing through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is a quick day trip to tourists making the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice will no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further from the historic center while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian are written by the New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given two or three hours.
You follow the flag-like guide to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini's prevailing and problem-causing tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must maintain this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark's Market is also one of the most popular places to visit at the historic center of Venice.
On the edge of the market is St. Mark's Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
The historic centre of Venice is home to only 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
They say tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment, and drives residents away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years, there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, a demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring the income it desperately needs to Venice and create the need for a large number of jobs in different fields.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is planned that cruisers would go away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, felt that the situation would change if the Venetian administrative area, where Venice is located, would have more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited every year by about 20-30 million tourists.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
Bad miles of congestion on the motorway
The lane north on the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has had miles of congestion from Thursday afternoon work at the time of return traffic.
The area is being used to pin the motorway, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km hourly speed limit for science instead of the usual 120 km hourly speed.
However, even in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon in some places at virtually walking speed.
Road work proceeded on Thursday afternoon on Lake Siilin at the Revelation Statue, or Golden Capricorn.
I get along well without such attention
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released stunning photos of herself in the scenery of the Grand Canyon, among other things.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in his current country, Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March by circling during the track tour 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre fence race at the time of the Norwegian record at 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media, quickly after his records, found that fame and publicity have its downsides.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Iuel in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close outside his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "study photos" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into private," Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he received in an interview with VG.
You can probably guess, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after running, but I get along well without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, father is a Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when the Amalien was 2 years old.
When the Amalis were 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first because of his father's work, then Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discuss than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches ask nothing, but only give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally deal with an athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records by 400 metres and 400 metres in a fence run.
Foot injury took the snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career at stake - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice to not hurt anything"
It's been nice to count now when nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland's most successful snowboarders, has really enjoyed her beloved sport this season.
Last summer, the career extension was at stake.
The footboard stress injury had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the foot didn't want to heal.
The hand had also been hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was doing, whether or not the board was going on.
Sponsorships were out and many things open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to pull the slope again.
The follow-up decision was then easy.
I knew it at the latest when I first went to snow.
I was so damn, yes, this is so much fun, let's pull a couple of seasons.
Korpi was not able to count properly until September and October, but since a long landing break, training alone painless has been a big deal.
Kisoja Korpi has only toured a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years for one race, and then you're hot for that week.
I can't think that way, Korpi says.
Today Korpi is racing at the Halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races don't like him on board, he always lights up in a tough company.
According to Korve, the appreciation of the Games organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, although some boarders chose X-Games in Norway to be held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, visibility is big.
I always think that appreciation depends on the conditions and the level of the games.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland's 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was at the point that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings you a new stream, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up on the slope, but otherwise I don't, that's the amount of power in the guys!
In the background of the ferry career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of the controller legend Pekka Korve is hooked on race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses, for whom he makes training programs.
When I am traveling all the time, there is no more time to be in the mess.
But I watch at least the results of the race every day and usually some departures, Korpi says.
Raviolation and race coaching are a potential career plan, according to Korve, when the board career comes to an end in due course.
I don't want to plan that far, but it's at least a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to stay on the nerves of time and develop, in the summer, maybe some departures.
If it is my future profession, then it is not difficult to start when you are already inside the sport.
Raw stuff also includes Elitloppet cruise with host Jajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that heads to Stockholm in late May to the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has been very sold, and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months, let's hope to fill the ship," Korpi says excited.
Attendo's care home project for Kitte has surprised everyone
Attendo Esther is the name of a new 41-seat elderly nursing home to be built in Kitte.
The building of a wealth of 1,700 apartment-based square meters will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbour Health Road.
With crystal, a common wonder is what customers are enough for the new treatment unit, as now during Siu's war, many private nursing homes are suffering from customer shortages.
Anne Flink Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kitee will have more demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes from Kitee Kanervikola and Eerika.
The deal was about business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo has no acute need to move operations out of these facilities.
More on the subject today later.
GMB is concerned about the continuation of McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the leaders of the McVitie's cookie manufacturer for long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the British General Trade Union GMB Scottish Department, the company has not announced its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has over 500 employees.
Pladis, who owns McVitie's brand, said it invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be the first to be reported" if there are changes.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB calls on the company to "answer concern that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, is of great concern that the factory manager is not informed about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and weak livelihood.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, and Brexit, rising cost of living and continuous reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow desperately needs successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis's spokesman, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed several issues.
We discussed with employees, among other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are constantly evaluating all our businesses and offices to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the spokesperson, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and we will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verrat
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after paying a £89 million transfer amount to terminate the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
Sensational move is the most spoken case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football series team is ready to break the world record for colonies. The previous record was less than half the smaller: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a £89 million transfer amount.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be furious about PSG's activities and the way Neymar has forcibly left company. A source near Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that it was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking best players at PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're after our players, we'll become their opponents and contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they seek our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verrat earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona is losing its star player Neymar because of this.

The calls Trump was invented - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never occurred," reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed calls with both the Mexican president and the leader of the Scout organization have proven to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had occurred.
He said Trump was not lying.
Sanders said many of the Scouts' leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto had been talking to the G20 in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone, but face-to-face," Sanders said.
Speech to Scouts sparked disapproval
Trump said Monday, the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for successful illegal immigration.
Trump said Pena Nieto said few will come across Mexico's southern border because they know the trip is going to the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not occurred.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump praised his speech at a large meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever been given.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, a Scout organization announced that it was not aware of any of its leaders' call Trump.
A previous statement by the organization's leader Michael Surbaugh, in which he had apologized to Trump for the Scouts, speaks his side.
Trump's speech at the Scout Agency meeting sparked a lot of confusion, as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of the presidential election last autumn.
