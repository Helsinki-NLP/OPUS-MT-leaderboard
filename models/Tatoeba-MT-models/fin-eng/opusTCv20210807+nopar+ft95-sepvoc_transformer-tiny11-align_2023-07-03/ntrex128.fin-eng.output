Welsh Representative Council members fear they look fools
Some members of the Representative Council are confused by the proposal that their title should be replaced by MWP, i.e. Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The controversy originated in the plan to turn the name of the Representative Council into the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the Representative Council are concerned, regardless of the party position, that the change can make them ridicule.
According to one Labour Representative, the group is concerned that the name "rimes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupidity and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group views the name change "openly", but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the word MWP to the word stupidity.
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context in a similar way to the letter U in Yorkshire.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently preparing a legislative amendment to the name, stated as follows: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council is of course the members itself."
The Welsh Administration Act for 2017 gives the Representative Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals that the appointment of the Representative Council as the Welsh Parliament will enjoy broad support.
The Commission favours the members of the Representative Council as the title of members of the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviation WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Representative Council are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to make a bill for changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on the amendments contains other changes in the functioning of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of representative action and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative reading, members of the Representative Council can give their last vote on the title under which they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot box in referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether the country's name will be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic".
The referendum aims to resolve decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbor is in practice an area requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership efforts.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' watches quiet as Harlem churches live in difficult times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say that there was a bar or church in every street corner," says Adams.
"There is neither today."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "People's contact has changed."
"Bars are no longer common living rooms in the neighborhood, where people gather regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that inhabit people are not those who support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"The most people who buy apartments from these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will speed up the day when these churches close their doors forever, because it is unlikely that most people moving into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original Caucasian Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by the black congregation under pastor John Howard Johnson, leading the boycott against the 125th Street merchants on Harlem's central shopping street 125th Street, after their opposition to hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martins, proudly called the tower bell game "poorist clocks."
An expert who played the tower clock game in July called it another name: a "culture treasure" and a "earless historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first tower bell game played by a black musician. It was Dionision A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell game to Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins didn't replace him.
St. Martins has developed a complex skewer in recent months, contributing to architects and contractors hired by the church's lay leaders and, on the other hand, the episcopal diocese.
Sacasti - the governing body of parish lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll the costs" to the scissors, even though the sacrific had not participated in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark damaged 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and damaged him while the boy dives lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help her water.
Hammel told me that he thought the boy was just excited after catching the lobster, but he then realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After getting to the boy, Hammel says he found that his entire collarbone had torn open.
"I yelled everyone to leave the water: There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, of which his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the affected shark is unknown.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been detected a few weeks earlier in the area, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablad's Ponto Beach to the Swam in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty departments serving expert advice.
This is a major movement for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which will continue to grow, even though the sale of fashion and household goods is deteriorating. Larger beauty care departments will be tried in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets aim to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's says its range of beauty products will double into 3,000 products, which include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
Supermarket will also launch its Boutique makeup range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open to Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition of food shopping to small one-time purchases in local stores forces supermarkets to come up with new lures for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Ald and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and in addition to Habitat stores. The company says this has promoted food sales and made procurement profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how the income from pharmacies in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows the acquisition, where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan that extends the range of luxurious skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said as follows: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in special coaching employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand range meets all needs and our attractive environments and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "drain" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his "brain" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household supplies and accessories for Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
This Morning's 37-year-old host announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business in the last few moments. She now plans to focus on his new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "ridden" at last Tuesday's tense meeting held at the Jones Business Empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that his new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their household supplies and accessories for Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin's Goop brand and was guessed to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million assets.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was supposed to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left all in amazement.
No one had faith in Tuesday's events so close to the release.
Marlow's headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting for sale."
This Morning host is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and his departure, according to experts, can cause millions of losses for the company due to product investments, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing for household supplies, not to mention the delay in the publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Trulyy in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked with M&S's new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source near Jones said the night before, "that we don't comment on his business."
Tight talk and then fell in love
He joked about the criticism of his comment in the media, which some would consider inappropriate to the president, as well as their positiveness to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said pretending to be a "news anchor" voice.
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first July meeting as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear weapons negotiations have precipitated.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North will not see the United States a "equivalent reaction" to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
He said, on the other hand, the United States would continue its sanctions, which are intended to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"With North Korea, it's going great," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said efforts to improve relationships with Kim have produced positive results. Missile tests have been discontinued, hostages have been helped to freedom, and the remains of American soldiers have been restored home.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out to this crowded hall for 10,000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience ahead.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroyed island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's population had been left homeless.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it very clear that they do not ask for international help, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children forms the Return group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to participate in the aid work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account the repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
Palu was likely to lose lives due to the missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in force.
Traveling between the numerous islands of Indonesia is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship ordered to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Return, but it will take at least three days to reach a new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's past infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign, and he has filtered money to improve roads and railways.
However, either the administration has been plagued by the funding gap, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Either pressure is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority in the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, arches and arrows, and other primitive weapons, which has led to the death of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sunk late level against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in the goal's losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the back pole.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Eventually, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell to the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and triggered without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match in half 1-0 Belgian Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave a heel feed to Mateo Kovacic in the situation before spinning away near the middle field and sprunk to Liverpool's field half.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed on the midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a magnificent pass.
Hazard ran away from defense and passed Liverpool with Alisson Becker's left foot shot in the back corner.
Liverpool will face Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death victims rise to 832 dead
The Indonesian disaster agency reported early Sunday the number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami to rise to 832 victims.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
The fragments of the collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Palu with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all those in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, and they may have vital information for the investigation."
A female spokesman for police has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, any people who may know a woman have come to the scene of the crime who have asked about her place of discovery.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim of what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless to learn what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it could take hours before they are released back in.
One officer was heard to tell the man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman who was tearing appeared at the scene.
He repeated his repetition that "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the area isolated in the afternoon, there were two huts, and an additional third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area that controlled the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call anonymously to Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 using the ID 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of the history rewriting deck
So evicting the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatic Puritan supporters destroyed English cultural and religious memorabilia as well as the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typery" and "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that an ongoing debate about removing statues would make a target of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not tell or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
False Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell embodies 19th century opinions and is a historical proof of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell a defender of Parliament against the external pressure, which was of course caused by the monarchy in this case.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate?
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th century dispute has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as a state nurse deserve praise and remembrance."
Killer pig sulking Chinese farmer to death
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified with his surname "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province. The man's artery was broken and covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pigher prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin were reported from a nearby Yunna province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the nearby pighouse door was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big boar with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed a 250-pound boar-sulking farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's feet were bloody and bruised."
Surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market's leaders told Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't hurt other police gathering evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market officials are reported to negotiate compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, and he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the wife managed to rush the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can serve as a "kicker".
"They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected appropriately," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring extensive heavy rains to southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is likely to weaken as he moves over cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, Sunday at 5 a.m. to the east coast, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is formed over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture north towards the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will then form extensive rain areas southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 25-100 mm causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in deserting.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimeter rainfall per hour in certain deposition areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
In certain areas, while especially in Arizona, up to 50-100 millimeters of rain are expected.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms produce local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal fences of Southern California.
Rainfalls over 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the area.
Fragmentary tropical rain showers begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but with the tropic stay quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
The central part of the United States shows an excellent example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of the summer will try to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern United States, with a temperature of +26 degrees off the southern plains to parts northeast.
In New York City, the temperature can pain to +26 degrees, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, there are good opportunities for higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched a hearing by Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million watched a broadcast by six television channels on Tuesday, in which Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual crime in the 1980s, gave his fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies suspended at a last-minute turn, according to which the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations based on an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Legal Affairs Committee that he was 100% sure that the intoxicated Kavanaugh groped him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the viewers' average on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels that sent the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers looking in offices.
Something about proportions is that the reading is equivalent to the number of viewers of the American football playoffs or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment. The channel averaged 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC was second with its 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC $2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million, and 2.52 million viewers on CNN.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras described how the protesters' cries escorted him to the elevator on the way to hearing the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed me straight how he stood for minutes with a look down while flying.
"I stand right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Flake said that his office made a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to report after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting on taking Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as claimed by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, based on his conversations.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of spying Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people criticizing his EU withdrawal plans for outpatientism that threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
Next to his interview with May, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls for a proposal that Britain and the EU would inherit each other's import duties, "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyto Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at LSU.
Dytoon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and delivered to prison, and according to Baton Rouge Police Department, is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a showdown between Sims and Simpson, where police say Sims lost their glasses.
Police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted Wayde's shooting during interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his guarantee was set at US$350,000.
The coroner of the municipality of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, a state police crime lab, Southern University police officer, and residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's physical activity director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement agencies for their "newal and justice execution".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father played basketball in LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "terrible" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Ash erupting from the popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexican.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions had been registered during the day.
The center registers thunder and vibration several times.
In social media, images were published in which in residential areas like Xochimilco in Mexico City were covered by a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have found 72 kilometers southwest of the capital increased since Mexico was shaken by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan Paratists bring together before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in a confrontation between protesters who support independence and riot police in Barcelona, and thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the resignation vote.
Police arrested a group of masked independence supporters who threw police with eggs and powder paint, which formed dark clouds of dust normally on streets filled by tourists.
More skirmishes broke out during the day as the police used their batons to control the mottles.
The clashes between the independence supporters and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, with the previous ones shouting "no forgetfulness, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received in the demonstrations.
Tension is still on the surface in an area of independence one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but celebrated by Catalan paratists.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was boycotted by those who opposed the low difference.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments in our lives."
I saw my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we are stuck in place," he says.
Despite the narrow pace achieved in the regional elections last December, but despite the vital victory, the pace of parties supporting Catalan independence has faded this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or detained waiting for trial in their involvement in holding a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a police-supporting demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the controversy.
"The situation is getting tight all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody until last years, announced that they would attend next year's European parliamentary elections.
"Being a European candidate is the best way to condemn the crumbling of democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into the house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car reportedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, we could shoot per car with a crossbow.
Livingston won Rangers with 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
The serialist Livingston stunned the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew was left without the first guest win of the season in Premiership, and next Sunday it will face serial leader Hearts, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet in the Rapid Vienna Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his loss-free pipe in the series for six games. Head Coach Holt has not lost once after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places against a visitor who suffered from lack of blade
Holt's team should have run long before their goal after giving the Rangers serious difficulties with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide with a goal advantage to Craig Halkett's buffer feed, but directed the ball past.
The hosts favorably handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
An important goal came in this way.
The Rangers caused Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga, where he was able to move the ball to the middle of the penalty zone and finish.
The Rangers had been holding the ball by then, but stated that the defense of the home team would hold, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not able to try much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow directed the ball past one more special situation in Livingston.
In addition, a penalty kick was demanded in vain - after Halkett, after Halkett, the exchangeman Glenn Middleton and the ball hit the hand.
"A great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to every player, continuing through the rise lines.
The team's way and crew have not changed much since it rose back to the highest level of series.However, Holt must be recognized for the way in which he has strengthened the team after arriving.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worralll on his toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but was now far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they managed to open the defense of the home team only once, and this should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, the middle caste on the league table.
Erdogan received varying reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is intended to correct relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000-headed people from meeting in front of the mosque, justifying the matter on security reasons, but still a lot of supporters gathered near to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the distribution of opinions, and some German Turk greets him as a hero as others blasphemed him as autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with a car
The cyclist died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwestern part of Deptford near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with lively traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the nursing staff came to the victim's help, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's accident site.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform him.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been directed elsewhere, and motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured by men's high security classification in prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 on Sunday British time and continues.
Tornado special police have been brought to the site to calm down unrest, backed by eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "HMP Long Lartin prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that the responsible people are taken into police care and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The warden was reported to have received hospitalization in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, riot police officers were alerted to the prison in October due to serious unrest, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drying areas can benefit)
There are rarely tropical low pressures in Arizona, but that is exactly what is happening early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remains move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rain floods.
The national weather service has already issued a warning of heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City cities.
Rosa is expected to move straight across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix's national weather service remarked in a tweet that only "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest modellings at the National Hurricane Center predict 50-100 mm of rain. On the Mogolin ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimeters in some places.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including central rock mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are actually obtained. In some places, it can rain up to 100 millimeters in total.
Rosa's rains can also be a blessing in an area affected by drought if there is no danger of heavy rain floods.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can be useful because severe drought has been suffered in the southern lunch.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, the second highest class, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes an invasion on his route on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. It is still a hurricane strength at 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when facing cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts, Mexico rains can be tough and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"Of 75-150 millimeters are expected from the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, and up to 250 millimeters are possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues his journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border on a tropical low spot on Tuesday's morning hours, and from there it continues its journey across Arizona to southern Utah by the late Tuesday.
"The biggest risks of Rose or its remains are likely to be associated with very harsh rains on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and the United States Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after 16-year-old son had been found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset during the night.
Police are asking for contact with anyone who may have video material stored on a mobile phone about events.
Trump says Kavanaugh experienced democratic party's "excitement and anger"
"On behalf of Judge Kavanaugh, there is a voice against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's "excitement and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified of his accusation in the hearing.
The president said on Saturday "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"The voice for strengthening Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with excellent merit in public service," he told his West Virginia group of supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican voting turnout in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the fullest," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took on the task of "opisting and preventing resistance."
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in the Kavanaugh nomination procedure is expected to be held to the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, deaths are expected to rise
Authorities said on Saturday after at least 384 major earthquakes and tsunami hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia, many wiped with giant waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many washed their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunam was caused by 7.5 magnitude strong earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach, and did not immediately escape, when they were victims of it," says Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the UK major accident relief agency BNPB.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but carried cars, tree trunks, houses and struck everywhere on land," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km per hour in the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air images published by the Disaster Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's technology assessment and application agency BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped to Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay could inflate a tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and that the damage may be greater on the coast of Plade 300 kilometers north, an area called Donggala, closer to the center of the quake.
Communication connections "are completely broken and no information has been obtained from Donggala," says Nugroho.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, there are over 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not saying that the tsunami struck Return, but authorities said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floors of the building is fervently shouting warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a water wall strikes the beach, which takes on buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a wide power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transport aircraft, but the evacuated still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has only been reopened for relief operations, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami has a victim count exceeding 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff have been able to safety in the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in the tent fabric shelters in the office's courtyard.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As the aid groups started their inconsolable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers are prevented from traveling Return.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only begin to flow once the accident area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"As long as the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can start receiving international help, but the declaration has not yet been made."
As the second night landed over Palu after a Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing people entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian suspension team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi says.
"As an older member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he had desperately tried to reach Palu's competitors who participated in the beach festival on WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the interdependence community.
However, only one grey sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blues.
"I understand that no messages were delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in connection with ATM supplement Newport on the Wide
The thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's guard worker on Friday morning while he was completing an ATM in Newport on the Leve, which is reported in a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and completing an ATM in the entertainment center," Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "a man ran behind him" who stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several people flee the scene, but police did not specify their number.
People with information about their identities are asked to contact Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name Ye
rapper Kanye West changes his name Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "a character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a nickname for 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who, according to the creator of the program, cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously reported that the word also has religious significance to him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
While discussing the album's name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "believed that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means only, and ended up in the shortest form Ye - which just embodies the goodness, evil, confusion in us, everything.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for its variety of names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he would prefer the names Love and Brother Love.
West's previous partner JAY-Z has also removed and returned the connecting line and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians, as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatellolo Plaza on Saturday, promised that "never would use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young people in Mexicans by providing monthly student financial support and opening up more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities would drive young people into criminal gangs.
Relations should double the funding of AI research
The United States should double the funding it uses to study AI as China makes the industry more efficient, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the United States administration, although the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to become a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Reducing the budget for AI research would be a good start, considering that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," says Lee.
doubling the funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI company called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held Microsoft Research's leadership positions as well as Google's Chinese operations director.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions in the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next would be arranged to identify future visionarys.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public assistance.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, but by large companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think doctoral graduates in AI should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government of its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to bring together partners in the industry and the academic world. The White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on AI.
DARPA also announced this month of a $2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
NSF, in turn, invests over $100 million in AI research each year.
At the same time, the bill for the establishment of a National Security Commission on AI has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum on changing the name of the country
In a Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to turn the country's name into the 'North Macedonian Republic', which would resolve decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the North Neighbor is in practice an area requirement for its territory, and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO.
The governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal in June, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether voting turnout will reach the required 50% limit to make the result legal.
The question in the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, could seek to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgiyevska Skopje, 79-year-old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of this House have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m..
However, the voter turnout was only 16, compared to 34% of previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when in the end 66% of the persons entitled to vote cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54-year-old, prepared a small stage and set chairs in front of tents boycotted by boycotted tents in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We are carrying NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like China and Russia as part of Euro-related integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership brings much-needed investments in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" sound was "opening our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute on Monday referred to 30-43% voter turnout in a referendum - that is, below the required activity.
In another survey commissioned by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
For the referendum to be successful, voting turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western-minded government after it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear trace of Brighton's defense at Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from the middle field.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero noticed being surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used his first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton watch Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet."
"We talked that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time."
Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the Premier League campaign.
The goal came in 29 minutes of the game.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in the situation.
He gave a beautiful pass through to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back pole towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker poked the ball into the net just before the end limit.
City will face Hoffenheim Champions League in block phase on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler in a match against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why force the start lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is always equally competitive, hopes to take over the pitcher in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have one win to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western series.
Rockies took at least a wild card with their 5-2 win from the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"Although we don't have a stake, at least we can get on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team here in Denver will create me the most demanding competitive setting I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to accept the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet released his starter on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer the opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training episode on Thursday, playing his 34 games at the start and feed on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and has burned the batter in the nest 300 times, with a inning statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican voting turnout in the mid-term elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big -- not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to the power handle by any means necessary, and you can see their meanness and malice.
They don't choose who to harm or who needs to be overpowered, that's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats took on the task of "opisting and preventing resistance."
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "hate and mean and malicious and false."
As he referred to Danne Feinstein, the longest influential democraticator of the Senate Justice Committee, the public responded with loud booings.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, uh, I expect a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am the latest in the queue's latest Labour representative, who is told I'm not welcome - just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentarian colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way just because he was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference stated on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I have served as a local Labour representative, Fridays of the party council have been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and the "friendly and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever started.
It is even clearer that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that every opinion is judged on whether it is suitable for the party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect a turnaround from me and statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it be national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is avalanche of insults on social media, which requires the withdrawal of my choice, the rejection of downtown politics and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day, and never waver.
Normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features in the politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that Labour should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with every motion of censure or rule of choice, the party will only become more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything goes well".
But that's not the reason I went into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago as a result of failure to the Thatcher government's single school, I have sought to promote better public services to those who need them most.
I have never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been surprised by my perspectives or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state is moving towards Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on questioning my trust in the Labour Party leadership.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at a block tip
Two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a win in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team of ten who has not lost any games.
A great defense and more successful taking risks was, after all, what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie may therefore be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "All honor to Ayri, they took risks better than we do."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes at Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, handed over by Warriors, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayr's management with a penalty paint, and just before half the time he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing Ayr's management to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayri Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose Bruce Colvine scored a goal after severe pressure, which the conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for scanning the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored the goal at the back of Ayri's maul, who left the sideline throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and spurred Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.

Getting it back is our duty."
In Bolivia, which remained inland, a memory of the coastline lost in Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource war is still strong — as well as the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, a spirit and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several Bolivians across the country are hopeful to follow the International Court's decision on big screens, hoping that the Hague will be advocated — at the end of decades of intermittent debate — Bolivia's position that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic President Evo Morales, who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year, will have a lot at stake next Monday's policy.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured in late August.
Some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if they decide, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin has no power to hand over the Chilean administrative regions, and the ICJ has announced that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is given only six months after the last statements are given suggests that the case "is not complex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has seized the question of sea connection," said Zárate.
The rhetoric that challenges Morales' quarrel has suppressed the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss at some point, but it is very difficult to hold negotiations after this.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
Former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia a "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right of connection to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament would not occur unless it can rely on the United States
North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to restart deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "far away dream" to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the Korean War's closing declaration would bring North Korea to their knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is on guard for adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang would be about to abandon the arsenal, which the state is likely to see as the only real means of guaranteeing its own safety, has received widespread doubt.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large headgear, which are soon also on your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a selection of special over-big headgear in their SS19 collection show that dazzled the styles of Paris Fashion Weeks.
Very impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also posted their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide plumber, which covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — just right before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with a snorkel and mask was more like a diving instrument, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for large fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing in the street image.
The hats of the exaggerated size strictly follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter lier, which has been seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the impractical hat, which has been seen in social media, also spurred another large creation into fashion shows — a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange reeded raffic bag with white leather hand straps was the striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Weeks.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I assume I see large hats and beach bags in the street picture next summer - designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of Scottish private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and communal success in sports, art, music and other communal projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council SCIS, are working to provide a high level of service to their students as well as students' parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, graduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an educational actor who can design and implement customized study content, we have found the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject to continuing in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships with people in other countries.
From this year's latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of the pass rate between private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the material, it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72 percent studied Mandarin, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently free-choice subjects, but are considered in the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study program as well as elsewhere.
Based on a survey commissioned by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it became clear that 17% of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job was explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of future career development for young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more relevant these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey commissioned by YouGov, 75% of more than 4,000 British adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language that was attended by a double-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in teaching languages is now important for children today.
Knowledge of languages in developing states in particular gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach languages that are supposedly important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child's interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron makes a debut on Sunday in San Diego
The expectation of supporters waiting for LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers ranks is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the season starts.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely playing incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the rehearsal, was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games before the Lakers.
"At this point, my career no longer needs pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election campaigns today at Wheeling in West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events planned for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennes and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the free place of a Supreme Court judge, Trump is working to increase support for future intermediate elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is likely to take a position on the hearing of this week's Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which became intense for sexual harassment charges that have delayed Senate confirmation vote as much as a week when the FBI investigated.
But the primary goal for the campaign series is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on the purpose of these next week's five events are "to wake up volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The control of Congress is so essential for his purposes that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign period," a spokesman who remains anonymous for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Today's venue is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, a state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls," said political scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting will to keep hope up before Sunday single games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-enhancing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe it, and more in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we'll take this success force a little bit," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind on the sails and a lot of encouragement, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas' condition, which allowed them to play all day together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior brick to green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the winning party intensified as his round progressed as he managed to level the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
Putti, which they won the 15th match was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You need to focus really well and just take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have scored more points while Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet two of Europe have won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo who didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this boisterous audience confirms that they are the favourites of Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, another more popular player to secure Europe's potential victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time in different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, which was mated with Alex Noren, a four-player hero of the morning.
One bogi and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish so deep into the pit that they were nowhere near surviving there.
On Sunday, no one will help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-player are fascinating to follow from a close perspective of couples collaboration: What kind of advice they give or leave out and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a considerable lead before the last day, but this four-player showed that the US team has a will to fight, although it has been suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the triumph of two wins from the rapping Tiger Woods, and got a score balance high to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain two years ago in Hazeltine that he lost a win, dominated a poorly played U.S. team in the four-ball of the morning, taking the match to the situation 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in the four-games, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's half needed eight points for Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four games.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball, they then finished the superiorly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously.
Woods, who barely survived Saturday's two games, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four games, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the four-balls of the morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to four, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything as it wants on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They acquired a resilient 2-1 win of Jon Rahm and Ian Pouller in a four-ball in Spain, and later 4-3 wins from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point chase station to levels at the start of the doubles, although the draw on Furyk's side is also enough to keep the win.
After two days of second, it may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea "does by no means" disarm without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that ongoing sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" in the past year, such as the end of nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the test site for nuclear tests and promised that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so under such circumstances, the fact that we are disarming ourselves unilaterally is not possible."
Although Ri repeated a familiar post of appeal that Washington does not accept the phasing-out of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every milestone, his statement must nevertheless be marked in the sense that unilateral arms undressing was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. sitting presidential and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, Kim assured "the Korean Peninsula's disarmament" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has formally sought to end the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang first have to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed facilitating the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for "to be stripped of nuclear weapons first", and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even resisting the "declaration of peace," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions will get us to our knees is the wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding, "If the party requiring disarming were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end."
Yet R's tone of voice was considerably different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing missiles to the United States towards the continental regions was inevitable after "bad president" Trump called Kim a "missile man" with suicidal intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea, but this year Trump boasted Kim for his courage to approach the abandonment of arms, but still stressed that there is still much work left and sanctions must remain until North Korea renounces nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he doesn't have a temporal deadline, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The strengthening of sanctions by the Security Council should continue to be strong and without failure until we prove a full, final and confirmed abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of ending the funding channels for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met North Korea's Rin in connection with the UN General Assembly, and he also announced that he would visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
Leaving Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event of the United States taking "equivalent measures".
Pompeo said Kim means the security guarantees Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course for adequate rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will attend a course this year designed to increase student rest. The course is a counter to a thriving macho culture at the university, where students weigh a long night with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basic issues related to their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of Harvard University Faculty of Medicine, who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first of its sport in the United States.
Czeisler had an idea for the course after lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me who said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I think was surprising," he said in an interview with the Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard University Faculty of Medicine and Deputy Director of Health Services at the University, says the university has ended up organizing a course after they had heard how students suffered serious sleep gaps during the week of study.
The class of an hour includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section provides students with a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants about how long-term sleep deprivation can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe they have the right to know about these issues in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
All-night study marathons are an increasingly proud topic, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even against increased weight, because sleep deprivation causes a state similar to starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after he had participated in one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave impetus to organizing a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all graduate students can complete a similar study module before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends setting an alarm clock to remind students of bedtime in addition to waking up the morning and urges them to keep in mind the side effects of "blue light" caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting for the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot won from Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were seeking their first win since February 4-1 game, which took place against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard now only suffered his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers remained eight points away from the current leader of the Premier League Hearts.
Menga fired the ball at the finish line seven minutes before half, and with the Rangers' fallen battle will, then no further leveled the situation.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game, and Livingston has climbed third place, and only Hibernia is above the goal difference.
Rangers may have other problems facing them, as Calum Spence was injured during the game as an object thrown from the guest stands hit the head, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the lineup with which the team had hit Ayr and progressed to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 lineup, with which the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again paid off when a well-built lineup managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate ball possession, Livingston was better off using situations for its own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free road to Allan McGregor's goal. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender Alan Lithgow only managed to shoot wide into the back pole.
The Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but the last third of the game was no longer self-confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly rejected the powerless shot of the Lassana Coulibally pusku and Ovie Ejaria.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing to Jacobs' long assists.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coldly escorted the ball to Menga for easy paint.
During the exchange time, Gerrard decided to change Coulibally and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack was cut off Kelly's impact on the rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long assists after another.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their leadership in the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could get to his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers exchange, also demanded a penalty kick after taking up with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanakka: Geigermeter inventor
Next, the page of our "Sunday Morning" almana: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigermeter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter also a key concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches" is well suited in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform scientists that seem quite like cattle:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter, used to search radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place the headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, an invention that still bears his name lives.
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see' malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ bad quality cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see' proteins typical of multiple cancers
Coerocotics have given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ HER2 proteins typical of multiple cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Based on our results, it's a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from the patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was caught in the teeth of critics after praising Trump at Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show did not go as planned.
Kanye West got boogings on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a snotty style and announcing that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song of the evening, "Ghost Town" Trump's Make America Great Again campaign challenge, West attacked Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
"I often talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The broadcast of the evening began with a sketch of Matt Damon's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Justice Committee, which relates to claims made by Christine Blasey Ford on sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's rant was not shown live, but comedian Chris Rock downloaded a fragment of it on social media.
It is unclear if Rock is meant to mock West with his post.
West also complained that he had been mistreated to the public because of the hat he held behind his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage this hat in my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm marginalized," West says in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to feel marginal?" and says he's wearing Superman cape because "when you can't order what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variety, West's comments sparked bugs from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of the present described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Conservative TPUSA director Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: "THE THANK YOU BIRTHING".
However, Karen Hunter, the leader of the discussion program, tweeted that West "is just himself, which is absolutely wonderful."
"I can decide, however, to have a whole human being (buying his music or clothing brand or supporting his "art"), which I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same goes for us," he added.
Before his appearance of the evening, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knife is charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after the man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyackamore area, according to police.
The accused is expected to have a Belfast court on Monday.
The charge will be checked by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Exhibitionist star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wavering hero role Jon Snow'na in HBO's violent fantasy series Throne Game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the machohero stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times' cultural annex, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the means in use to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, who also married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a member of the Throne Game star guard, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity evokes strong feelings in me at the moment," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth, which has led to now observable problems?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters that occur in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues, "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In an interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the pre- or sequels of the Throne Game after the series ends next summer, because he has "acquired enough of battlefields and horses" in his own words.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, who tells about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know her future Rose wife was the best thing the Throne Game has offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life ever since," he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygrite, Harrington played Jon Snow's love object in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estates in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: New infections have increased by 14% in China
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV positive and AIDS-related citizens by 14%.
Health officials say the virus touches the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, the HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of the efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican Senator information and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied the claims that his employee would have published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website.
A Democratic Representative from Los Angeles assured that the claims are distributed by "extreme right" commentators and websites.
"Slights, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the published information is reported to have home addresses and phone numbers from South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the state of Utah.
An unknown person published the information from the United States Congress on Thursday during a hearing from the Senate Committee, which concerned accusations against sexual abuses against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that according to the Hill newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address associated with Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he or she has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You should behave moderately and calmly in the situation."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' place in the mid-term elections in Congress, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that it had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies as a result of these fraudulent accusations.
"We make sure the perpetrators are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be held legal responsibility for any destructive and dangerous action against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again - an underpower Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already an established tradition of searching for Brexit references from any film that is tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which originated in 2003 on Johnny English and came back to life with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Newborn".
Can the language of the nation's satire made in the cheek become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the glared, cumin-like and incompetent Johnny English has earned his license hernia for the second time. Even his name tells us above all that it is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English world.
Of course, it's about the pole secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe a melting glamour around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unfortunate one-note musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical worldman who left sheer chaos, which Atkinson originally presented in Barclaycard TV ads.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor's stages are knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts get out, but the humor itself seems underpowerful and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious' film brands such as 007 and the Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
Humor seems aimed at children, and Johnny English's crazy noise doesn't seem as inventive and sharp-looking to me as the comedy of Mr. Bean's mute roles in Atkinson.
The annual starting point is that the UK is in trouble worse.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field to the dismay of the agent in service — which is presented as an unfortunate small performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the important-greenling and superficial prime minister who is already up to his ears in the swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson will do everything in the faces of the Teresa May parody character, but the script not only provides him enough space.
When intelligence advisors inform him that all spies on the field have been exposed must be called someone who has already set aside from active service.
It is of course numbing Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject stings some clever jokes; English keeps School of Rock types of lessons in the secrets of intelligence activities.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again his endless patient battle couple Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to be able to gain his rights.
Thus, catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of His Majesty to face the fatal supercriminal Ophelia Bhuletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey immediately becomes a farce: a duo disguised as waiters on fire from a fine French restaurant and causes chaos in a secret quest for Volta's luxury hunt. The company to explore Volta's house with virtual glasses ends up in a pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the authors are running out when the final scene comes, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit done for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English movies, I have come to the same reflection before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for four-day work week with five-day salary
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra holiday.
The plan would allow employees to enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would ‘suit’ for the party's economic program and its plans to tilt politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day work week as a means by which workers could benefit from the changing economic situation.
The source of the High-Level Labour Party tells the Sunday Times: "It has been announced before the end of the year's review.
Change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to support the four-day work week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive indivisible support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesman states: "The four-day work week is not a party policy, and the party is not considering moving into such a thing."
Shadow Government Finance Minister John McDonnell took advantage of the work conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "fainted dictators" and "debiters" of public interest companies.
According to the plan of the Minister of Finance of the Shadow Board, the current shareholders of water companies would not regain their share as a whole, as the government led by Labour could implement "reductions" on the basis of the irregularities found.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds that would allow 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to be transferred to employee management.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss 60 minutes on whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week a final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, and the delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In a 60-minute episode sent on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open compared to his South Carolina colleague.
"So, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I heard... I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut into the stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added Christine Blasey, referring to Ford.
"No one of the people he named was able to confirm the matter.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I can't see what could change about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a performer guard as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty from the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which originated in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in eradicating poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience must perform various tasks or "works", such as volunteering, send an email to a political decision-makers, or make a call, or perform some other act that spreads awareness of the project's goals.
But how has the Global Citizen been successful now that there are only 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others — a fantasy that you can change the world by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million "works" for different goals since 2011.
It says that these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles that are equivalent to over $37 billion, which have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the UK, committed to "helping the development of children to their full potential". The group committed to supply Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition in the country. This was after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries, and the world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the papers of history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also said the British government was urged to take steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children with more than 5,000 actions, and the government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions about the frequently asked questions on the website of the movement is, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's answer: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, like major civil rights struggles and anti- apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman date a New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the country could make it difficult to export energy by using the Navy as a "block"
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner, said Washington could "if necessary" resort to help his fleet to prevent Russian energy spread in the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's action in Syria — the invitation of a legal government — is an excuse for the sounding of new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia]'s reason for presence in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke said.
According to the office holder, ways and means are available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep ship routes open by its fleet and, if necessary, by surrounding to ensure that the energy they offer does not end up on the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public of an event organized by the Energy Consumers' Association, a non-profit group profiled as a "energy consumer voice horn" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "single trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements date into a situation where the Trump administration has sought to enhance the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with a much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To intensify this, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says will tie Berlin to the Moscow leash.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metres transmission capacity of the pipeline in use, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is purely economic reasons, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose it as a journalist," says Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I feel very problematic that the third state will get involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the German Confederation of Industry, recently said after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully" to run for presidential election in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "consider carefully" stand for president after the interim election.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and correct our faulty regime, and this also means a woman at the leadership of the kingdom," he said.
"After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider standing as a presidential candidate."
Warren estimated President Donald Trump during the event by saying that "he is taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren wrote "I guess we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, according to a poll released on Thursday, the majority of Warren's electors do not support this to run in 2020.
According to a study conducted by the Suffolk University Department of Policy Research and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the senator's running.
32% supported the nomination.
More of the respondents supported former Governor Deval Patrick running with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other famous Democratic candidates raised in the discussions for the 2020 elections include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump election ceremony
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and was charged with domestic violence
"What my son has to go through after returning home, I can well identify with other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers will bear," he told an audience gathered at Donald Trump's election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest ‘power horse in the living room' and said his son, like other war veterans "return home a little changed, they return hardened, they return, wondering if he and his comrades in the army and the Air Force have done this for the good of the country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling the gun intoxicated.
18 states and Columbia Alliance support a lawsuit against new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbia Alliance are seeking a change in a new policy that came into force in the United States, that asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a letter to friends of justice on Friday in Washington, D.C., and the letter supports asylum seekers who break the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been announced in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action, which was raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says he was abused by his partner "and his sons of a violent gang".
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, much of whom are from asylum seekers in the United States, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that spread to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the Board of Appeal of Asylum Applications in 2014 that undocumented immigrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, public prosecutor of the Columbia District, commented in a statement Friday that a new policy "will ignore states, federal, and international law over decades."
"State law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of application-specific facts and circumstances, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle" says.
Prosecutors also claim in a letter to prevent asylum seekers from accessing the practice of damaging the U.S. economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring the additional workforce needed."
Public prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges on entry cases to suspend asylum from victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Safety is intended for persons fleeing their homeland due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion," Sessions announced a new asylum practice in a statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even serious problems —which people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts of survivors continue in Palu — the number of deaths found has already doubled
For survivors, the situation is becoming more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while calming her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring new bodies one minute by minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered things, and try to save what can still be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from fractures of the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated due to constant, strong aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounted how a furious earthquake shook the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and tells him that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "provosing" with "propaganda announcements"
The US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using an American newspaper as a means of propaganda, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump referred to a paid annex to China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the November 6th Congress. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's efforts to interfere in the US elections mean a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, according to US officials speaking to Reuters.
While it is normal for the foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war, where both parties in turn impose customs duties on the counterparty's export products.
Chinese and American experts said China's revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa at the beginning of the Trade War that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime Iowa state governor says Beijing was doing damage to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," wrote Branstad in a statement of opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious traditions of free word and press in the United States by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the newspaper booths of Beijing streets, however, dissenting opinions are only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy at all. This is because the media is firmly in the Chinese Communist Party's leash," he writes.
Branstad continues by saying that "one of China's largest newspapers dodge the offer to publish" an article he wrote, but not specify what magazine is all about.
Kavanaugh fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind and defend the Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh can cause a counter-reaction, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections, according to analysts.
The emotions surrounding the case have been in big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to proceed in the vote.
"These things cannot be withdrawn," says Grant Reeher Syracuse, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse in an article published on Saturday by The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona) a last-minute offer of an FBI investigation appeases angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesman for the national reform group MoveOn on Friday, according to a newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November coming" as the Senate Corridors decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, an unattached political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans progress with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Speaker of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned. It's about how Republicans have acted and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, a leader of the Democrats-supported Priorities USA, pointed out on the news channel.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony as a narrow majority bends to the latter.
According to a new opinion poll made by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake pushed the matter forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one else, Deborah Ramirez," The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed Kavanaugh, before the Justice Committee, harassing him while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him at a student party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project in the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to which information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes Inrupt's intention to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal data warehouse", or POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal data warehouse is that it is fully up to the user, who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, Inrupt's idea is to give the resources, processes and the skills required to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently comprises a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt's website. All of this is available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss "Facebook and Google about whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned on their heads overnight."
"We don't ask their consent to the matter."
In an article published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt's "a mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of a new network built for Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains its position as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers the Hero Priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest awarded the Victoria Cross Medal at the Church of England, who was a soldier, after 100 years since the events have passed.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Pastor Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellengline and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, the sniper was created four days later without ever knowing the highest honor of the British army he received.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "acting symbolic"; the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in very dense fog and under fire from heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line and "the greatest valiant" led the troops to advance before his assaults alone to the field gun.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died a German sniper was created on 4 October 1918 — just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that evokes respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann counted the wreath after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to take part in the parade" and added, "The great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of the free match were waiting all night for Bellator 206 tournament - television channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the whole event will be presented.
The show at the San Jose event had 13 games, six of the main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6:00 in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to the great dismay of Pipsa Posuu viewers.
Some of the viewers were not really happy to stay up all night due to the match.
One friend of the break-up opened on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with a child drawn "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, the content in question was not appropriate to present at 6 a.m., so they had to switch it to the children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior assistant director for marketing and communication, changing the program."
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said the schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking about a remission to probably get the program to work," Coker said.
"However, it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't show up until Sunday in our time, which in turn is Monday in their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to go one way and the other and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but a legislative matter.
I can promise you that next time this will not happen.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of her sexuality
Swim jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of her sexuality, but this motivates him to success.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he came to secondary school that "not everyone is the same as me."
Daley, who spoke on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, says she talked about gay rights to give others ‘hope’.
He also tells you how, after having a child, winning at the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a permanent host of a long-term radio show, has taken several months of leave due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt 'lesser’ when he was young than everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work."
He says, "To this day, these feelings, feel less and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show that he is ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and appears at this year's Commonwealth Games to appeal to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
A three-time world champion tells of his love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — as a "come a surprise."
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age" — he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced similar compassion and adversity," Daley says.
The couple had a boy in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — which has resulted in Daley's "whole perspective" changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of just 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he's not going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I liked her hand when her breath stopped. It wasn't until he really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally realized that she wasn't invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this is something I've dreamed of all my life - jump in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song choice in the broadcast — Heather Small's song "Proud" — which evoked feelings as he prepared for the Olympics, and who still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-fitting Mickelson replacement bench at Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson, an American, breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must cheat considerably to avoid the record round being left in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time at an event playing every two years, moved to the exchange bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the duration of the fourball and foursome on Saturday.
Usually, the American five-time Major tournament winner, which is the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other side on the field trying to get his beats.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course, where a long-grown roughness punishes inaccurate beats.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, there is a well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari in the field itself, who will play with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to make a tube of all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but whatever else you could say in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today, and he applauded me in, scolded me, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how this went and this is the solution we ended up.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at people's expense and he's a funny guy that everyone likes company," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week, and it's funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his bet in the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup's extensive leadership before the doubles of the last day can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who survived the winner with lime lines just and just by his nose measure and won the narrowest possible margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds themselves of how we run briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, though scarce," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-3 wins both on Friday and yesterday, moving to a 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big kaliber.
We're going to the field and doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we only aim for that.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side, but we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
I am delighted with how his team players have performed a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until they drop in such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be given priority, and then we will talk about different things.
It is great to be in the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when the field is alone, then the player's capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be passed on to players — tomorrow everyone will be able to make the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require better performance by its players as individuals than they could be as partners. The exception of this is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's turnarounds in both directions. He was a team that won Brookline before ending up as a loser when the European team won "Medinah with a miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed his team's lines to the dawn of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like what happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When you get it moving in one direction, it piles a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our lineup accordingly and put the boys on the field the way we want, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to run a defense battle and meets Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the next to meet their European counterplayers.
"I put the group guys in this order because I think it's carrying through the entire tournament," Bjorn commented on his double choice.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy's latest frigate should have been introduced in 2014. The ship aims to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but will be introduced not earlier than next year due to defective systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesperson spoken to Die Zeit, ‘Rheinland-Palatinate', the introduction of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are scheduled to replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with efficient cannon, missile systems for air and surface ship control, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signals detection technology.
Important features of the ship also include its longer maintenance interval - new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
However, constant delays mean that warships representing the top of technology — which are said to improve Germany's influence in the overseas territories — are already obsolete at the time they enter service, Die Zeit points out.
The bad-happy F125 frigate ended up in headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to introduce the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk of essential "software and equipment failures" in German media that make the warship unworthy for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly central to the fact that the crew of Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half the crews of the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is remarkably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's chances of subsequent updates.
Rhineland-Palatinate, with a 7,000 tonnes of capacities, is believed to be twice as heavy as the same class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price tag for the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to the stunning amount of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of introducing new frigates have emerged as the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable ships "are running low".
Authorities say the problem has increased over time because old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg class frigates could have been introduced to the fleet.
Environmental organization eavesdrops on hidden lives of bats
A new study in the Scottish Highlands area aims to determine how bats utilize terrain while hunting food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide you in future conservation measures.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland observes arduous and dwarf bats, as well as ear beads and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
The study places specific storage devices at important points in the area to monitor bat operation during the period.
The organization's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the pronunciations and the species at any given time are ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created, where bat behavior can be presented in an image following the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's nature conservation advisor hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how different species utilize them.
The information is helpful in planning areas of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have decreased considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful in catching catches than eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning technology to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization focusing on rural environmental protection that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of areas across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, rest site inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only protected area for the protection of bats only on the lands of Thrave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway region, with eight of Scotland's ten bat species found in the area.
According to nurse David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bats need to succeed."
He emphasizes the importance of checking buildings for bats before taking place renovations, because the destruction of one bat resting site can inadvertently cause up to 400 female bats and chicks' death and eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to challenge the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram to his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel for allegations they have called "unworthy reporting on privacy concerns."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player demanded compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayora reportedly met at a nightclub and moved to the player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the papers delivered to the Clark County District District, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after an alleged event and told him to be a 99% good guy", but whose "one percent" disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and took photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a compromise because he was "in horror about the possibility of revenge" and concerned "to be subjected to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking abrogate procedure for still traumatized from the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the deal to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with a $100 million contract.
Brexit: UK "will regret forever" end of car manufacturing
The UK would "street forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit," Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered "careful" Toyota's UK unit's announcement to temporarily suspend production in Burnaston in his factory near Derby if Britain comes off the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays will be visible in job losses if Brexit is reached without a contract.
The factory in Burnaston — where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are produced by nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions to our factory's production," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit came true.
The main concern is that car manufacturers say that the risks associated with the supply chain when no-deal Brexit is realised.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT basis, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from the UK and the EU, and the cars are made on request.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and trouble from parts.
Keeping a warehouse lasting more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need a deal, and we want the best possible deal that not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity we need to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"Not only Toyota's statements, but also from other manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far."
Toyota cannot tell how long production would be stopped, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union official at the factory, says the concern is growing among members: "My experience, jobs lost will never return.
A government spokesman says, "We must present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be "must be postponed one week" due to the rolling womb, Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, which in turn is investigating Russia's interference in elections, Trump's assistants' contacts with Russia, and any action by the president to prevent justice.
For months, Trump has been rumored in Washington that Trump intends to fire the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardise Mueller's investigation neutrality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of dismissing the president based on the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is reported to have Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the day of the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "preferably" would separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with a hearing from the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI-week investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press manager Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said, "The date for this has not been set. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed another week due to everything else going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than repulsiveness of TV journalists' "retention", but said, "I don't deny the fact that they are noteworthy."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press should increase.
"The president holds more polls than any president before him," he says, and adds more evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"Press sessions will still be held," Sanders said, but "is infinitely much better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to do this often and have seen us act this way several times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing at a press conference alone is rare.
This week in New York City, the president possibly showed the reason for this when he appeared to journalists who were uninhibited and occasionally strangely gathered on the scene.
Health Minister wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries in relation to fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to Scottish health care workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hopes for staying in the country after Brexit.
Scottish Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for EU citizens working with specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal distinction.
I know that for all of you, these are uncertain times.
I would therefore like to repeat now how much we value every employee's contribution to citizenship.
Colleagues from all over and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers supportman Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team had disappeared 31-27 for Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tenesse journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombi oxygen on the sideline before placing him on the stretchers and took him to the side for a more accurate assessment.
Tennessee State official told Chris Harris, a reporter for WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has been able to undergo surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no knowledge of the type/wideness of insult at this point," and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for the first season from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used according to the Conservative Party's new plans to help the homeless.
The purpose of the change is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million per year — to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce a higher stamp tax rate from foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to taxing good-income people.
The increase in the stamp tax is targeted at people and companies that do not pay taxes to the UK. The extra money from this is directed to the government's actions to facilitate the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee — which is added to the current stamp tax in addition to the second housing and investment housing increases added two years ago — can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million each year.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-UK permanent residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers in the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital — have become ‘open cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to facilitate the purchase of young people's first homes.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to remedy Britain's "faminent situation of housing".
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of "confidential evictions".
He would also like to give councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says, "I said last year I was going to own my Prime Minister's British dream — that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, can buy housing as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "extreme goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots are enthusiastic about his challenge of raising the country's northeast corner home to its feet, currently in third place in British Division Two.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country's team.
I made it to team two and that was it," Ross reports on BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that's something that has always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only come if I succeed as the club's manager."
Ross' predecessors are managed by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic director says he was not concerned about entering the shoes of his renowned predecessors in a prominent company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I am carrying out my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think I'd only be successful if I can pilot the team back into the Premier League."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's assistant director and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
He then helped Alloa rise from series three fall games and raised St Mirren from falling condition to champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his player career in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at the actual crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he took the lead to Alloa.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I made a little good and enjoyed some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player must deal with a wide range of things every week.
I still go through the same things, like stress and the pressure of work, but running the team seems just the right task.
I always wanted to run the team, and now I do it for a living, and I feel better in my body than ever in my adult life."
The entire interview is on Sportsound broadcast on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy the pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., a study shows
The summer heat wave has caused pubs struggling with Britain's difficulties, but at the same time piled up more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but restaurant returns fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consulting company CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer than anticipated participation in the World Cup meant that July became 2.8% higher in July with 2.8% higher sales, while restaurants were even worse.
The 1.8% decrease in restaurant sales only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decline in sales of restaurants.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than those of restaurants.
It seems that people wanted to just drink out in their minds.
Sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, with a 3% drop in food sales."
Paul Newma's RSM company, providing consulting services in the hotel restaurant industry, says: "The results continue to trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the market for off-home meals.
It is no surprise that the struggle for restaurant chains continues, although the decline in 4.8% annual sales is stinging, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to the operators focused on foods at a worse seam, and only time will show if the hotter temperatures in August bring the greener temperatures to the breath that the industry desperately needs.
The combined growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following sales in the UK's pub, bar and restaurant industry, which compiles and analyzes results data from a group in 47 sectors with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion. It is considered a reliable measure in the industry.
One fifth of children encrypt social media accounts from their parents
One fifth of children — some of whom up to 11 — encrypt social media accounts from their parents and teachers, a study says
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of the growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concern that accounts can be shared with sexual-toned content
20% of students reported holding a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One fifth of children — some of whom are up to 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of a rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has increased fears that sexual-toned content can be published in the accounts.
20% of students said they found cleaning up a ‘main account’ to parents while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after hitting her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
A study commissioned by the Digital Awareness UK and the Rehtors Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 held two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to keep secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle to the "voice of athletes" to the Scottish athletes' government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-led member of the Scottish athletes' Board of Directors, taking part in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. The Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the term as a great opportunity for sports makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience collected by the athlete over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is enormously respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit tremendously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as athletes' mouthpiece and hope I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
An American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals, won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a permanent commentator on the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell you how to recover and what condition.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm already training agility!

The breast pumps company's nursing mothers who like dairy cows have shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wear-in breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by an advertisement made in the cheek and conforming to the style of music videos, which describes the freedom the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn, among other things, in the words of the song: "Yes, I milk myself, but the tail is not visible" and "if you didn't notice, they're not udders, it's tits."
The chorus continues, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
A video of 77,000 views and hundreds of comments has sparked a conflicting reaction in viewers. Many say it makes fun of the daily ‘horribles' of the dairy industry.
"To use cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after childbirth," one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented: "Understandfully it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can't they be used to promote a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
The third commenter added, "A complete reality-compulsive advertisement."
The ad also received defenders: one woman admitted that the ad was "mad" in her opinion.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads in one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and ‘know themselves as cows'.
The purpose of the ad is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unobtrusive pumps in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is discreetly suitable inside breastfeeding vests, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother advertising agency commented on the controversy: "The Elvis pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By chesting nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump to the spotlight, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and recognizable way."
The Elvie pump has ended up in headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two appeared on the catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
The number of migrant children arrested has increased sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because, as a result of the rough rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration, children's placement in foster families has become more difficult.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrollment as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must give their fingerprints, and that this information will be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, proved last week in Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of the foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal with cases of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases the case must be dealt with in the court within one month instead of the 60-day time limit previously in use, the reception centre employees say.
Many appear through videoconference rather than personally when driving their case in a court dealing with immigration cases.
Those who are not considered legitimate for help will be deported as a matter of urgency.
According to reports published in recent months by reception centres and the system, the time spent in prison for children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's despair can go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children suffer from trauma at the moment.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey's "manner forces" to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is at war for the eighth year.
Mouualem, who is also a substitute for Prime Minister, said foreign troops were illegally in the country using an excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "with them will be acted accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Mouualem claimed that the "anti-terrorism war was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "holy fight until all Syria is cleansed" from both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign troops."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has placed more than 1,000 soldiers in the land torn by fighting.
On the refugee issue, Mouualem said circumstances were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "distrining irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created the opportunity to pursue political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on an area with three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists including al-Nusra front fighters, "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new government and opposition committee to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and smooth the way for elections.
Mouualem set conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "checking the current constitution" and warned against interfering.
Why Trump is elected for second term
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to want, the release and scandal will decide his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best viewing time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has been able to reach cable TV with 3.5 million viewers as the most important news nights.
"This is a blaze that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," Neal Baer, the main producer of ABC's Designated Survivor program, said of a minister who will become president after the attack destroyed the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how it happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of expert panel that is arguing about Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, the "pod of arrogance" and the unpreached descriptions of Stormy Daniels President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he does feels like a reality TV show because in part it's about giving the audience something every night," says Wheelhouse Entertainment director and Panther Lantalaamo series creator Brent Montgomery Trump's show changing people and daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the cart.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a wonderful sunny day at his place on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flows from the outside to a tight intermediate election struggle
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has been faced with a real cash flow, as due to the restructuring of the congress election districts, two candidates already elected are forced to fight for one place.
This recently re-limited Pittsburgh constituency is a fighting challenge for Democrats Conor Lamb, who was given its place in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division favoured Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic struggle in the main party financial departments at the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the March special elections of the 18th Pennsylvania Congress Election District in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been in the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won by 20% in the area.
Political commentators have been a great start for Democrats.
The United States planned punishment for El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild response in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and he also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group's leadership team.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to invite American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan is no longer recognized," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered to El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017 for drug control, as well as development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrators made it clear that the meeting was wanted to proceed and this effectively decided on speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a mid-October meeting some sign of the weight the administration gives for the gathering, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of anonymity condition.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible block of justice by President Trump, of which there is now very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to conduct an investigation into whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia became involved in the U.S. elections.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump finds himself accountable to it just in preparing to go before his constituents again, and that he may have to be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifsits here, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's defeat is inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We must make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the following years of massacre.
The course of history is twisted into such turning points, where the inevitable pass of democracy either accelerates or is delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled since it became public that she had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and pondered the president's possible inability to handle his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times report is incorrect.
"How do we react if the recently required FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, are we voting for Congress in the mid-term elections that holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will be in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table decorated by a swastika.
How can I have anything but optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic to meet Rapid Vienna
The Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that earlier that month after a draw against Villarrel in Spain, the victory for Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach Group G of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villareal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old player says.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we could have caught the win at the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got off the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we can give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can press to the fullest now, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings takes a night's sleep from women
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them but don't bring up the subject," says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell us your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional person and family about where and how to obtain help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Bring financial advice to the discussion: advice can also be used to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care funding options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance applicable to covering these costs, or self-published insurance if you can afford.
Prepare legal documents: block legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in order to name a trusted person to monitor your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take care of financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parent is on the way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just for the financial side, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What drugs are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police describe the attack at about 0:30 a.m. as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, and officials say the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication connections to the area are broken, rescue authorities have received no information from the northern part of Palu from the Donggala municipality, which is closer to the surface centre of 7.5 magnitude quakes in intensity.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Key information about Palda and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawes province, located a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawes Island, with an estimated 379,800 population in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of the coast line on the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated 299,200 population in 2017.
The main industries of the central Sulawes province, and especially the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel extraction is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, several tsunamis have been hit by Return and Donggalaa in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in Sumatra coastal waters.
2006: The 6.8 magnitude quake struck the south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of Sumatra's Mentawai islands, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pigie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice president candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by Alaska police, Palin, 29, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and prevention and opposition to domestic violence in connection with arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone from her female date when he tried to call police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial investigation prison and the guarantee amount has been set at $500, reports TV channel KTUU.
The report said Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "really innocent."
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he or she can be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and $250,000 fines.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, which can be sentenced to day imprisonment and $2,000 fine.
Palin is not charged for a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting the face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to a service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication connections are broken and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
On social media, videos are circulating from the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for beach festivals in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing a rare death penalty on suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York City are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight lives of New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway bike road in the south of Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for the death penalty in the southern administrative district of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to show that Saipov killed his eight victims and caused "purposely" serious physical injuries.
According to a court document, it is possible to impose a death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court filed a 22-point charge on Saipov, which included a charge of eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases related to organized crime. In addition, the charges included a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as "terrible, cruel, and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliji, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the prosecute announcement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The previous time the New York Southern Administrative Court has given the death penalty has passed a decade.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to serving life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in a federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of conspiracy for Soviet espionage during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of regret over the days and months following the attack.
He informed the investigators that he did feel good, police said.
The charge said Saipov said he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to 22-point prosecution that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of liberation is the solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked him not to be required of the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure on Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentary representatives suggested him to lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative line representative Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would "be out" if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But May faces the challenges of its deeply divided lines when reconciling the challenge of being struck by conservatives in favour of ice, who joined a separate anti-brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface of Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposals and chaos.
Bone said at Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "wrap the Chequers proposal to go."
He suggested that Farage should be involved and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added, "I'm defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not fight world wars to end up being subjects.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone knocked out the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely flawed claim."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexit supporter, also took part in the march and said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added, "The prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians should have to feel the pressure if they are to reverse the decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is now about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we won't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to faint Brexit will have to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Great Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before the two-hour opportunity in the city center.
A small number of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with the party app at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they get IT systems in order and all technology for Canada plus plus arrangement and frictionless border functions for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a full farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Masschusettian Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chair for Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign in November.
Warren has been thought to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters after the beginning of Trump's season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman in the highest place."
Arrest in the shooting of LSU Sims
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police said they had arrested a person suspected of a Friday shooting leading to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyto Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET announcement.
Police had released a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a fire injury in his head and died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present during interrogations, holding a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist and was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship team arrangements offered him a win from Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton almost his own devices defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pit later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after taking some contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up his position after only two third translations movement.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
He was then in charge of much of the competition in prolonging the exchange of tires in aiming for a quick ending and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed great all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional task, reaching a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim on Saturday that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a testament to people's "expect, viciousness and dishonesty".
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious, and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you year this information?
Do you remember his answer... will you years of the document - ‘o, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
When we were... no, we didn't leak," he added the senator, sneering.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's accusations concerning Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked out in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wish."
But his ban was not good enough for the president, who commented on the matter at Saturday: "I tell you that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment and thought Democrats would use accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to get back to power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and viciousness, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," Mediaite reported that the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars applied for a refund to the defeat of the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an initial lead due to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels before Dwyer restored the Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who won Dundeen 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pitch. David Ruther fed when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed Cownie's handicap goal in 15:16.

Air traffic controller died making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller has become a hero after he died, ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and a tsunami caused by it hit Sulawes Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area and several people have been trapped in the city of Palu.
Although coworkers fled with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation at the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He remained in place and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely released.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News news broadcast reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Kalimantan's Balikpapan to transport him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached the Return.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the sacrificial number will grow to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have reported that contacts with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are deficient.
"The group is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in the ruins and not many people have been reached," said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
35-year-old housewife Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushes to help survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday of Return and said to the country's armed forces in a speech: "I ask you all to work day and night so that all the tasks related to the evacuation can be completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after an airplane crashes into a lagoon
Representatives of the airline of an aircraft that crashed into the micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now report that one person is missing, although according to previous announcement, all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it would try to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the lost passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane drifted over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in waist-deep water for emergency exits.
He said that passenger staff panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors in repairing a nearby port pier participated in rescue work by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the aircraft sank into the deep water of about 30 metres (a hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents timeline for the night when she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution completed a re-examination, in which the man was accused of burning a Miscissive woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on a mobile phone to bring together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers at the night the victim died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tells' mobile phone was at Chambers' house at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis told me the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "squeaking because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The final remarks of the defence are planned to be started on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed from Bristol, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise in the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for racist text message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "again one black".
The couple denies being racists and equates the challenge with "tightening."
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her trouble when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and dawned on her that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, THE DIMAL," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband for a text message.
However, she then sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, had separated Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that his African-American nanny, who received their previous departure passports, had done his job poorly and had been waiting for a Filipino this time.
Maurice received payment for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and wants $350 a day for a six-month period for which he had originally been hired to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a reasoned solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in an interview with Posti.
"But would you leave your child in the attention of someone you have been unfriendly to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and said that his wife had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will one be hunted in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, dating their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that the public would not identify with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It's hard to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's amusing now that Paddington's tremendous popularity is known."
Considering that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about abandoning his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary year of the book release seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
He "described as a very important family member" and stated that his father was quietly proud of the success it achieved.
"He was a rather quiet man, and not a guy who was at all squatting," the daughter says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement for him; one of whom you are proud of, even though it is not really your own accomplishment.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave honor to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save his life.
"Nad called me all the time and told me it was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors kept his heart running gradually faded out of his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where there were families and other people around me.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourns his daughter's loss, boarded the plane among other passengers - who knew nothing about the trial he was currently going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt tremendous sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Griefing women send cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis' son Tyler contracted depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want anyone older to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, reports that his son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile will illuminate the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was "darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and lost her partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after her mother had died.
"He didn't say he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was just down on Christmas Day, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like it."
He notes Mark's death was a difficult trauma to them, but they still have to survive: "It breaks up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on with life and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts his investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he hoped - a time-limited investigation - we might be able to achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee 'disperse' the supporters would cause a dead end.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called senators to lobate them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report was drafted?
A vote is currently held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow across the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls during Kim's time
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted South Korea's Ministry of Unification and reported that leaps occurred last year, 127 - in 2011 they occurred 2,706.
According to Park, crucial factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in human smugglers' prices.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
Most of North Korea's defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have come across the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a strongly protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees and most often forcibly returns them.
Further technically, relations between North Korea and South Korea at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stagnant negotiations on nuclear equipment.
This followed the June historic meeting, where U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed in general an effort towards the Korean Peninsula nuclear disaster.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho reproached the United States for getting stuck in place after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will by no means unilaterally begin to dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unsuitable to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford while they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotional and sometimes almost shouted and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic Members of the committee without calling the accusations against themselves as a "grotesque and systematic persecution of a person" organized by the Liberals who have angered from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when asked if he would raise an alert against Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats received a majority in the House.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, including the court in which he is currently working," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working in the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible regulations on health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In the hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of justice and expected to say that it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything
It is a legitimate fire talk with months and years of rage over, and he can't keep it without crying.
"We think when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying too when she got angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speech partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying: "You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a path of dissolution of rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I cried speechless of rage and an older woman - a cold-sick supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your mind sorry."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 by a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the highly frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least one more was needed.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and seven dwarfs.'"
Since the campaign period was already far along, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters who gave male candidates $1,000 gave him only 250.
"Do they think I get some discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings - gratitude to his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work against voters or delegats, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
"You might have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone is probably being beaten as a obituary
‘He cried.'"
How the American-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The starting shot for the U.S.-China Trade War was ear-drained and although the battle is far from past, the Mediterranean break can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's main export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week was with new customs duties affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded every time in the same measure, most recently imposing five to ten percent customs duties on American imported goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it doesn't seem to be the second largest economic power in the world being delirling for a moment.
In order to retreat Washington, you should give in to one's own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts state that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A slow political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that begin a economic downward spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have understood so far," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant familiar with Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country is "ready" to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country after a devastating war that lasted more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to correct the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return to the country from which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures for their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid in the country.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for help in the reconstruction of the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team to 16.5 against 10.5 Le Golf National in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, and it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown for themselves when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had trouble throughout the tournament and hit his starting punch in the water on the 16-hole of the par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players who has received a score of 5-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was left with 5&4 European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked the world's top player, lost with 2 and 1 to Ian Pouluter in England, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European ever with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believed in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It is about the team and I am glad I could be helpful," said Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He moves the torch to his compatriots Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 individual competitions played on Sunday.
"I feel a huge pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics on one of the best players of all time who have won 14 major wins and will be second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high-quality throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said his team had failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys," they fought.
We pushed the European team in this morning's games.
We got in touch.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We team up again, work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to lift a hat.
We met our winner."
Red tide algae bloom situation: concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, there is a general decrease in algae in the Tampa Bay region.
According to FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may indicate a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide algae bloom extends on the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be detected ten miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
Red tide algae bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the Pinellas County coast in the past week, concentrations ranged from low levels to high Hillsborough County coasts, from background concentrations to high concentrations in Manate and Sarasota counties, background concentration at moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and background concentration at high concentrations on the coasts of Lee's district tension, and Collier County had low lengths.
Respiratory symptoms are further reported in the Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
Over the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in Florida.
