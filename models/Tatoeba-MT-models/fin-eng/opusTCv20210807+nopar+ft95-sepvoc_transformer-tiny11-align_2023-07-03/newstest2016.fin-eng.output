9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's run away from Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The missing announcement of a boy who started with his friend from West Tampere has spread on social media.
Police Situation Center said the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found in the area around the home, the father said.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, tore the goal difference Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued to factory in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Champions League goalkeeper turned for at least a moment for the benefit of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved to the top of all-time goal scorer statistics when he shot two hits from penalty kicks and one of the game situation by visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was leveling with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits together.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but in Group D of the Champions League it started with a 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-diffed Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend Premier League game, did not come to the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's guest match only lasted 15 minutes.
The dangerous-looking sliding tackle of PSV's Hector Moreno hit the manU kit that attacked the paint so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before medical personnel went to hospitalization.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 line in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The Painting season in the Champions League began Group Paris Saint-Germain.
Angel Di Maria, who changed Manchester United shirt to PSG-nut, was involved.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past the back corner of Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half PSG.
PSG has been betting on the success of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career departure club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow's TsSKA lost 0-1 in a B-block B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party immediately demanded resignation - president gave false speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not apparently realize that the speech was the same during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party MDC called Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely on Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extra summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU leaders' summit for next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, who is leading the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of Home Ministers, according to Merkel.
Teacher admits to shooting girlfriend during emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a voice, just a slightly colored university teacher, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the dead woman's immediate relatives can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found a handwritten message on the side of Amy Prentiss' body and enemy: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter, who, according to experts, is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a kept history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, to the door of this study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said the university staff members heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call for a while after.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the tail.
Authorities still tried to determine Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but possibly had problems.
Students said they waited for his hours.
Police of the Prentiss' death, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Second student Mikel Sykes said Lamb said he was under a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know, but that "clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb fled campus, police got on his trail as he moved back to Mississippi, Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of her parents' house in the suburb of Mississippi Greenville, Washington County, said Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running on the yard road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 when they met through friends together.
Hair and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Hairston for many years to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer around that time.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
The former Prentis husband Shawn O'Steen reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and they now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentis when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a shady bar near Gautier, The Julep Room, says that he last saw Lamb and Prentis on the night contrary to September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were kidding and throwing squats to each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, told Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candle devotion was held at the Cleveland Delta State campus, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported on Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster of Pettus Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that police now say Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prettis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for holiday season
Toys R Us says it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but a toy and baby products dealer says that current permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months in the holiday time, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help occupy stores, as well as selling, sending and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his " date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the upcoming documentary film Back in Time trailer.
The film begins and comes to mind that I am just a fake and hand stretching away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and Production Director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg reported, "For me, it's the finest time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available in video on demand, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syria's situation will not be resolved armedly
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "does not solve armedly", and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France in connection with the General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to solve."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support Surveys That Show Donald Trump Is Seriously
Some have tried to label him as a wind van.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to curb Donald Trump off the top of the support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the latest 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been in charge in the two-digit century, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's appointment opportunities.
Of course, the election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump will likely become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom received any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use their funds to bring him down.
The following recent support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popular figures have made a turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University's support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans are currently positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support survey by Quinnipic University in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans reported that they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson produces roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "inspired" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
Next, the most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "satisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, a favourite of the authorities, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52% of Republican-mounted voters at national level think that the real estate king has a character that suits the president.
According to a survey last week by Quinnipiac, the first party meeting in Iowa, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has a character that suits the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post survey, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for acting as president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated for Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican party voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible at their disposal.
At this time, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican party voters find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans settle for another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as support against Trump has been divided between numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie for every 33 points.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a large 18-point difference.
It is the majority of Donald Trump supporters who said they made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey from Tuesday shows that only just over half of Trump-supporting voters have decided who their voice will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% reported that they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in their campaign start speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pomp will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration into the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in a Monday ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a person outside the politics than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey on Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans have become frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will face David Cameron for the first time during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs are watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain Air War, has sparked criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A Corbyn spokesman said he "respectfully stood quietly" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the Labour Party leader to sing the national anthem despite his view that the royal room should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements on economic, defence and foreign affairs, and originally less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that line calls regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also been "baptized" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Trade Union Confederation that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government's Secretary of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party was "especially clear" in that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced over the past decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "massed" ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and received over 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, MP of the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too opposite and that he intends to refrain from both clever wording and pricking, promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary Angela Eagle will be a substitute for Question classes when Corbyn does not participate - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the point.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further from a political theatre that is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question lessons, but he later had to admit that he failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of assessing the manager's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticised the lessons that have only become a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make it a profit.
BBC News met one of the first young people who graduated from the project.

The value of the pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring estimates of the rise in courses.
The pound rose against over 1% to $1.505, and 0.84% against EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20% after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news from a competing luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market in Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5% after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
The shares in the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations on the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sports clothing company announced its six-month return before taxes: an 83% increase to £46 million.
JD Sports manager says higher wages could damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill says.
The cost could be directed at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash begins grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year to South and Western Australia, which are becoming up to 120 stores. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food brokers and build an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough offer tastings in IGA stores, and store owners sell discount tickets for Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29, as this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot in the game, as South and Western Australia make up nearly 30% of the IGA trade area in Metcash, with higher yield margins than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
Visitors to shopping in South and Western Australia are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first movements, and turnover is obtained from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually on sale and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 30 stores in the south next year and 30 stores in the west, producing $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash's high fixed expenses base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very potentially lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of Metcash's board would have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food business, which transmits products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43% since 2012. This indicates reducing debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is holding off, and has invested over $150 million each year, lowering prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers restore stores by adding faster growing fresh food, as well as bringing a better range of private brand products to market.
Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice says that price lowering and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of profit growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation Chairman Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinikis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been suffered bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. She deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo called "Special Ks", was involuntarily public about the incident in which Cyrus annoyed Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery pruning match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to distinguish between Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a unwavering defender of the Chefs.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth from another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I think Thanasi has just been pulled into the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat while losing because of the cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently well, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature for 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to join Kyrgio in the important games that will begin on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but still supported Canberra's return to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of publicity to consider these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrest immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of killing the influx of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled violence in their home countries have now erected their tents and settled on an indefinite period between the inspection stations of two countries.
Frustration, however, increased.
As the police helicopter stays above them, immigrants kept saying "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it would be "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not causing damage to civilians.
There will be a debate with other countries and Brussels in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
Sekasorto on the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after the 28 national group failed to create a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed with the division of responsibilities for 40,000 people seeking asylum who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and ministers spoke hopeful of reaching the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary will not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases can be speeded up.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also set up a barbed wire fence for some of its border against Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival in the European Union for refugees, many of whom are at war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage the 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, as well as include longer prison punishments for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by travel immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally accept the expected military position for next week, but the Associated Press journalists on the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had captured 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached a further country.
They got over by harming the fence, are now captured by police, and are accused of violations defined in the new laws.
Authorities are fixing the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two out of seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a barbed wire covered train car to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds tried to shove inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
One group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National survey shows Hillary Clinton's leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed on the side
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will catch him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (calculated from 58%), and the second Sanders is supported by 27% (rising from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary elections began, most democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice, however, more rigorously than supporters of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is in charge of women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start in Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading to older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit century among liberals, but now Sanders is running this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters say they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says he supports him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favor of Clinton - only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican first-man Donald Trump says the same is said by fewer Republican voters (35%).
When asked about the open question why they wanted her to be nominated, the most popular answer was that she had appropriate experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10%).
Clinton supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the vice president affects the possible presidential nomination, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though a third disagree.
When asked Democratic voters who they would choose second for the party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership from Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the management is 20 percentage points, but if she fails, the number is 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this standard, Biden is far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voted has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in the candidate, democratic voters put opinions ahead of voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden does best for the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation and says that the matter did not affect their general opinion on her.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The people's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email polymic did not affect their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36% say their opinion on him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion about Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters in the whole country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Six of the candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion about him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in a study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national survey
Ben Carson to be close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey, leaving others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from the previous CBS survey of 23% of the previous CBS poll before last month's Fox News election debate to 27%.
Carson, however, rose dramatically from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is displacing Trump among higher education Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from 10% last month to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of this latest September survey of 376 Republican voters is +/- 6%.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC survey showed Carson to be on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery in vain, although Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College's first year student
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternal chimping ceremony in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chu's "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his taking to the hospital, thus contributing to his death," police said.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a backpack of over 13 pounds full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground when he tried to walk through a icy field towards the paint.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurts, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but according to the accusations waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national chairman Andy Meng, asking him for advice," police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the fraternity before Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
Deng was not allowed to be refreshed, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng suffered repeated blunt object blows to the head, body, and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity stunt, while at least one student has died as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury advocated the first five members being charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also prosecuted for violent chimping and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to be held accountable only by individuals, and if there is an organization behind what happened that accepted the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dissolved its connection with the local department.
This happens when the US Central Bank raises interest rates
Interest rate increase comes, and the market for emerging rates falls, bond returns rise, and the economy is falling into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it takes to all this or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help with timing when it comes to the economy.
The recession has taken only 11 months since the first withdrawal, sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Federal Reserve in interest rates has been often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why US central bank officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the trajectory of time going to normalize the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
Eventually, however, market participants can see that any fuss related to interest rate has been oversized.
"The first increase after the global economic crisis of the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economy expert at Global Affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, will be a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it has no effects.
Below is a look at how some economic aspects will react based on past developments:
As seen in the market over the past month, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that capital returns tend to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn potentially reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market is usually strong, with about 14% rising when approaching the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is quite steady (average rise by 2.6 percent), and normal status has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports in a recent analysis of Bob Doll's leading capital strateg Bob Doll, published in Barron's.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on stocks is usually clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when returns begin to decrease.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rate purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed in the past and can accelerate the recession.
This is especially a GDP that will be closest to its lowest level ever before the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 withdrawals after 1950 have only twice had nominal annual GDP below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 percent, few believe it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been prepared for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all cycles of increase have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in super cycles where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly since recovery has begun," the report says.
On the other hand, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting far to end the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
Fixed returns have also been unstable as the market awaits interest rate, and the model is somewhat similar to the findings of capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank moves its line, its effects are more quickly visible in the bonds than in shares.
The direction of the bonds' returns seems to change immediately at the first increase/section of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the return on bonds will immediately fall," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategs believe that interest rates will result in convergence of returns on longer-term and shorter-term bonds, thus leveling the yield curve.
High-return bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about seeking a return," said Kathy Jones, an analyst for a fixed return at Schwab.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to Dollar's strength and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies with mainly located in the United States win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt perform worse as the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive in the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have in funding.
"History shows that 'quality' shares are usually more lucrative in the three months after the first interest rate purchase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover bypassed weak turnover companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower quality companies. The average of the former was 4 ( percentage points) and the latter 3 ( percentage points).
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside of stock exchange speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses channel of "popularization"
He claims that its separation from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating Brit Awards
Commissioner Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "popular" its content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "conscience" - is becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seems to be the Brit Awards, which was held under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I can remember when you actually just copy something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than previously to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering criticized for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a member of the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million, according to estimates.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is not distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 program, in which star judges are Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced "especially in the BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future The Voice seasons from being produced, or to order that the money of the licensees would be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest increase since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has been growing tremendously for over a decade and turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of online sales leveling in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales leveling in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at growth levels in previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people shop online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's leveling, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday event in November.
Last year, five times more buyers flocked to their computers to catch trades, pouring many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue about the discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made from online stores.
Meanwhile, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of wearing fashion chains for shopping streets.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident, consequences for Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the collapse of construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed down
29 dead were carried through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when the crane collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners mainly dressed in white filled the route to honor the first dead to make their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed a sacred place where just a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and poured worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family construction group to be guilty of a disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes killed in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton from Manchester. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a major mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already sworn that hajj Mecca will continue as thousands constantly arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
The Arabic version of the decision published by the state-led Saudi Press Agency said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors have been forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall in the yard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage that was held later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the misery and its representatives have not been caught for commenting.
The Royal Decision also blamed the group for not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the large mosque of Mecca, which are part of the huge construction robbery led by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi government family for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy banned by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim should do at least once in their lives.
Authorities say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered one million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and permanently injured.
The other injured get half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap working workers are behind popularity
British are increasingly using the services of helpers, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix shops for professionals are opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
British people are said to give up their hammers and paint benches and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home rehabilitation work
It seems that if you are handy with a hammer or beat up to paint walls, you are in a minority today.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store are made by the most beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are more single-woman economies today, where more home rehabilitation work is done than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of those only five women who lead the most important companies in the UK FTSE100 index, which has rebuilt her management team with as many male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% women in the group, including its CEO and financial director.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher announced the bill in both six months' returns and sales after the group took over the cost of closing the stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three aces government decided to resort to compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were quite quickly achieved.
The sharp head of SAK and other employees' central organizations began to force right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the extensive demonstration of workers.
Many people think that reason stands.
Let's ask if it's worth strikes when it's going bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the report that he will not participate in the demonstration but goes to work.
In the old good consensus period, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net to protest, but openly declaring up a deer would have been a small person's political suicide.
A million-member trade unions in protest of a few tens of thousand people do not get much short, but it gives cause for thinking.
The trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it did twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the violent solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, now we finally get to the union, that is, the rights of the employee, visibly and properly.
The government may therefore want to hold the role of the Ay movement, as membership in the trade union may be seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the actions of the organisations think, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should be forcing everyone's head.
High savings course for the University of Lappeenranta: Towards savings of 8.5 million, personnel reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a savings course that aims to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations for all personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
An additional two million other activities are saved.
The joint negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates the actual operation to be in deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the government's cuts in appropriations.
In this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million in deficit results.
Costs will increase slightly for next year, but funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and the decline in corporate funding at our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last the six weeks imposed by the law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first is the local transport of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After the commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, Onnibus's plans are welcome at the Ministry of Transport.
Other international companies have announced their interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail traffic elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows when the US Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
When Reuters conducted a survey to 80 economists, just over half of those who still believed the central bank was raising interest rates last week now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event, as the central bank cut interest rates to zero is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institue for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillion dollars to the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 a.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves apology
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning, before shooting his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "devil" for the first murder and hoped that "you could cancel it," officials said Tuesday.
Gautier police officer in Mississippi reported that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send constellations to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone", but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb that read, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt before finally killed himself late Monday when police surrounded him.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know, but that "clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed that Prentis was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "law or evidence" of any kind of "trimiodrama".
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentis for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentis had a 19-year-old daughter who has "shocked".
O'Steen reported that Prentiss and his daughter were "once best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentis.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there, and ran into the forest where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about education at Delta State in spring 2015, says a resume found on the university website.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he contracted leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires its toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw had a double fracture to his right leg when Manchester United lost PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture and he's in the hospital now."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties, and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted as follows: "Thank you to all your messages, the words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw case and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
PMI coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this heavily because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn't see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns something: if your child loves a book, it won't last long until you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax book, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post published on the SuperCamps website and continues, "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book for my children because it always seems to be a picture or message we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the following song, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Tarville within the might, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is merchandise, Ted hopes to win his dream girl's heart by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes the love story, which Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, was not written by Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds in places as if it were taken from the plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville inside the majors, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win their dreams Audrey girl's heart."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so uninformed about the drink of the book. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has destroyed the greedy, tree-beating and need-woven Kerskanen, regardless of the short, mustache creature Lorax that "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron staff, but did not comment further at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left behind the English team, but it was still a tough place
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut away the guest win from the bills.
Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than a team three years ago, but it involves good twisters and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in its spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth fell from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth from the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricket players are criticized based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about the choice of Joe Root before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice.
About a hundred points more, and the Lyth season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't do exactly as well as he could have, and it doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first chose Jonathan Trott to the Caribbean when Lyth was in top condition, but that missed opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a batter I appreciate.
As a cricket player, he has something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same chance as others before him, but of course this depends on the team's line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
There has been a balled idea of Moeen in a batting opening alongside Cook, which would get an extra pitcher on the field but to keep four quicks, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a puncher can't hit there, and this left-handed person has already shown himself to be quite a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games when the first jam dropped before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a spare pitcher, and, what I've been dealing with him, she feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at her unfurnished statistics - hitting an average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there are not too many pitchers on offer and selectors chose young people.
He's learning a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for games can prove to be a genius stamp.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games, and brings both energy and relentless hint.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether it be gaming or coaching, and he has the same kind of money to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested at one-time, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and elected do not make schedules.
And one must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Those who support Britain's departure from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-village renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever greater problems day, even if one doesn't take into account even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or not?" Corbyn's choice for Labour leadership or for the anger of the Confederation of Trade Unions for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatic buddy recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of disagreement concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries do not want in the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them either if they erode social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfieagent.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without the local eye-seeking, and then come home saying that they win supporters for reforms.
Everything is about me.
My European friend who wants to look outside the British EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', it is said of Berlin - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point that they don't care we will then leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her actions before it gets ruined in the same way that happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France faces a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading power too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain has a leftist.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for the Selfiebrits when their energy would rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends either.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even plan to consciously make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 British referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a thing that was held" and "The negotiations were of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have been able to experience how the voracious Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU skeptics are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest European opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "the EU's direct bananas" while being Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband was perhaps a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse number of tax-encrypting veterans, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are domiciled nominally elsewhere and who own most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but realized that if you were in a cage with a lustful gorilla, bananas must be abandoned for the bluff unless you want to be on that gorilla lunch list and later still dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blaric than Blair himself, in terms of opposing Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgiven him that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly applauded me at Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-involving Neil Kinnock's 80s boycotted Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is still forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, but no doubt Andrew Marr, whom Corbyn left the BBC couch on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, beautifully, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party Ukipi's war paint and the wildest nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his internal scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to call the rough John McDonnell shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his father priest was plugged on TV, trying to be disloyal towards his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But for the fight to keep up with "in the situation anywhere" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor by everything Corbyn told the principals and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the 24-hour TV era, and especially in social media vortexes, which is an acceptable breeding platform for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic sightseeing regarding EU membership (and aligned with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-understand debate with left-wing fighters for whom the narcissism of small differences is a key dogma in doctrinal shaves.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby will not campaign to hand over), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) in concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize Public Health England e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated in a meeting of 12 people, where some had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in his report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this "postpost" report last month, describing it as a "covery review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "exceptional shaky bottom" of PHE's main leadership decision.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ have wondered whether the claims are "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects PHE's claim to "the best estimate that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed evaluation and modeling of evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-crit criterion decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinion on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in research.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors at the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly previously received funding for research independent of Bristish American Tobacco.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people in the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they received funding from the sector in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco director also attended the meeting.
A study produced by the group "a lotingly admits" that there is a lack of "unquestionable evidence regarding disadvantages in most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, says that the claims made at BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "Electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than burning."
Half of those who have burned their lifespans die from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die from smoking-related illness each year and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we meet our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" of such hits as this soap series on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience, difficult broadcast times against the most viewed programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to create a relationship with the BBC for six years.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC is producing and sending programmes that would clearly fit unsubveled competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the permit fee is held - and I'm not sure it's a good idea for this media or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others don't do and produce.
The Voice is sent to the most important broadcast time because there is a desire to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly implemented inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give any of it.
I don't understand how it's about public service transmission.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all."
Channel 4, serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004-2010, said the BBC is guilty of hunting number of viewers "because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series resemble comments from former Sky leader Tony Ball, and he used his 2003 MacTuggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that public service programs from the BBC's smaller audience "go to BBC4, where often the number of viewers cannot be measured, but the BBC thus meets its responsibilities and then can hypocritically state that 'I guess, we do all these unknown programs that no one looks at'."
They put them on a mission where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the permit fee, Johnson said to the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people who £150 is a big money because they don't spend much on the BBC.
Former Skyn and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its Reeth's early mission to "information, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should model Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the mission to "information, educate and entertain".
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says only a few are shown on television, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these can be viewed online.
"Vonigenetics" allows brain cells to control with sound waves
The video shows how shuttles change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems to control them by sound wave eruptions.
Tiny shuttles change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for human ears to hear.
The impulses work by turning on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure that conducts electrical impulses into human brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttles do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that bubbles strengthened ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4-ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
To manufacture ultrasonically controlled shuttles, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, microbubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turn on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that there may be some benefits in using sonogenetics compared to optogenetics.
Unlike light that must be sent along optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus it may be possible to get the targeted human neurons to react momentarily to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Advertisements put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's weapons fair.
Horrible killer machines!
Ankle-crushing legging!
Grape rests!
As well as electronic stun bats that cause painful pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and imagery of comics leave no doubt that this advertising of the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to trade weapons for repressive governments at Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre at the London Shipyard Area.

With a separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and metro trains, requiring more accurate access.
"Earious information, Will you travel on the DLR route on September 15-18?" together is asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track becomes a picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of gun dealers arrives on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the museum of cruel plans).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is a six pound pack of hex hole keys, which, according to the collective, "main access one third of the advertising space of the entire planet's bus stops".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "proclaim vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to the Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are questioning more and more and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in resistance as they have realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to influence society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed via Facebook over 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created by a free advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background commentator also worked for free.
VRCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty point in the ExCeL calendar then - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were toying with the idea of a more realistic advertisement of obscure corporation, but "it was more stopable to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at fairs," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in relation to the gun fair comes from inside ExCeL when exhibitors are peddled fantasticly embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that he received an order from the U.S. military for the "AT4CS RS to be launched from the shoulder."
This includes "a unique tube bet combat tip that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dormant at the age of 19, and then I still believed in berettes and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can be anything that gets on the nerves to be completely scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell you where you're from, whether you liked the middle year and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why "I don't really love or hate Marmite because it's really just yeast extract HAHAHA to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, not those you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they share fire extinguishers.
Give people room.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and luxurious entertainment venues, but they are also the places where people wear and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think you're starting a university while in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of hiking from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socialization and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when there was a speech: knock.
A guy in my student dormitory thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a bit of things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start college in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate baking plate and presenting yourself seems to some extent less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your resident partners feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will join your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check the milk owner.
It is possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more adult than my dormitor who confused detergent in their milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not be messed up so that people can't sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverb's pot ringing a pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The answer was the increase in volume.
When they finally quieted at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before putting their own music on a roar, locked their doors, and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormant with you?
Or inversely, wouldn't it be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a dorm partner as your future spouse, teamed together, separate, and then you would see him every day and possibly lose all your friends together to him.
Of course, the heart wants what you want, but if a hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to make sense at your bottom.
In the exhilarating moment you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but it can be cancelled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson in safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.

A racist attack on Kitee for foreign students - The house envisaged as reception centre was pushed in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said before, it is not the accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of Kite's Evangelical Folk Institute.
The windows and walls of the People's College's accommodations were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one window of the accommodation space, says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, a responsibility teacher for youth social guarantee training at the People's College, there were an estimated ten people in the vandal building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," says Luukkainen.
People from 12 different nationalities are staying at the People's College.
They are students in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed building has a-status.
Some study in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some study Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one has wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
The mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The authors are suspected of being at least three men and had been on the move on a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend night, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," says Luukkainen.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident occurred last week.
This was reported on its website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn a swastika and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been reported to the police.
Focus on 15 September at 16:02 Fixed incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the target building.
The state closes the Y train to Karjaa - passengers in its nipples, "just idiotic"
The Y train, which runs from Helsinki to Karjaa, will stop running in March.
The news indignant passengers on the early afternoon of that train at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the shutdown strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Just idiotic because the population is growing all the time and working people need a quick and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video will come to the capital.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
H and R trains on the main track will be combined into the new R-line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced on Tuesday information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and the routes to be closed are throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
Make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes to regret.
The Y train is also used by non-raaseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by train the fate of those traveling further away from the urban area.
"It's especially bad for those who have to replan their journey," he said when he was paining on the Y train.
A little relief is expected.
A new train connection is probably coming to the Rantarada, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), i.e. take it all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring more costs to HSL, that is, in practice, the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to find out different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million years for the Y train, of course, the Ministry much more than this.
The R-line on the main track skips two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train shifts doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts are reduced by Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made with over half a million trips per year in total traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is expected to bring the state a 12.3 million annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital Current Affairs: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The global economic crises have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, known as former chairman of the SKP, the topicality of Marx's Capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and intrusion of the capitalist economy increasingly on all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is timely "now and forever".
Is the former CEO of the Finnish Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual notion is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went hard wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the Industrial Revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now, Marx's interests such as the distribution of wealth are being discussed again.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand the big picture, the world changing as a result of a technical upheaval," Korkman analyzed.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Yet, Korkman thinks Marx is worth getting to know.
"In the 70s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoans and Trotskys and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political ballast of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, AFP reports.
A UN report on the Civil War in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses war crimes both the Sri Lankan Armed Forces and rebels known as Tamil tigers.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into fighters.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it was planning to hold an investigation itself, but will not allow the UN court to be established because of foreign judges.
England's yo-test allowed social media to push
The autumn matriculation writings had a long foreign language on Wednesday, which most had English.
England's skills were tested by over 16,000 candidates.
In the experiment, you could write a substance on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a writing of 150-250 words in English could be addressed to the online magazine's advisory board keeper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the substance, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed the third subject, Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo Swedish-language high school.
The third subject was only a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we have been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says and rated the entire experiment as "almost normal".
In English - or Swedish, the English experiment was allowed to answer questions about texts that, for example, the adaptation of summer sole to climate change and the processing of large data masses.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52), and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when it is up to another domestic, or Swedish or Finnish experiment.
In high schools, the test is held normally, meaning that it is not affected by the demonstration of wage earners.
The Student Diploma Board urges the candidates to find appropriate transport connections in time so that they can attend the trial.
You can get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
Trade was robbed in Oulu, threatening
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Clock district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commandohead covering the face.
The man is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a gross robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
The protest against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police officers at work, on the other hand, are not only tasked with the alarm missions and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant protest is running.
Roads leading to the railway market will be closed to motor vehicles for about 9:30 a.m.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the roundabout of Kaisaniemi, from the west from Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems enough.
I don't take a stand on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to a demonstration.
The police don't tell you the exact patrols.
"Some people are coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police urge you to avoid private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic bundle extends from Hakaniemi level to its city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until early evening.
With protesters from elsewhere from Finland, there are also many subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed to the Railway Square.
Buses are pretty far away.
The rest of the trip must then walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, this is a positive side.
The issue of public transport fluency, which is normally at hand at these big crowd gatherings, is now partly done by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark in Finnish political history, says emeritus Martti Siisinen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Siisinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the Ay movement is indeed trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday's protests.
The sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the crowd that the Ay movement would like to take part in the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai in 1993, Siisinen says.
The Murrostorstai, organized in the middle of the deepest recession, gathered 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (center) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage earners' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now relations between the government and the Ay movement are perhaps even worse than in Murrostorsta's time.
Besides, the highest bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, Siisinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still certain elements of the old labour movement during the threshing time.
Several thousand protesters are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undistributed support for wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
They're from the edge to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the operating methods have increased in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid harming or destroying property, Siisinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also impressive strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among other things.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electric strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by the settlement board's proposal after seven weeks of strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people gathered off the House of Representatives, many who made the recession unemployed, to demonstrate for the work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were forced into egg rain while farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU will quit," one of the slogans was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers were dripping tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and gang redundancies by nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass removal eventually accelerated the negotiations to the result.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - by compulsion," included the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike for municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted five months and brought about a lively debate on how strikes could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central Criminal Police investigates background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on their way to Finland.
Everyone on board the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees who travelled by a truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to the Yleisradio that first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man with a foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for human trafficking.
The captain of refugees, former drug courier and a stubborn businessman - the story of five smugglers
The rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human trafficking into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at Trento University, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel agency they write is published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human trafficking, present solutions, and present smugglers from different steps of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of them right away
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head to that summer celebration.
In terms of its location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the trip to Lampedusa Island, which is part of Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, is home to Emir, a burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir makes about 8,000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for him customers all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again collapsed with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir accommodates them in empty houses for as long as he sees good.
Food is given so that customers just stay alive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
On the first night, you drive away from the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been dismantled in half an hour and Emir goes on a return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once the police shuded him, he threw all his passengers over the side and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one by side and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The quietest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He says he has to abuse this for this.
I'll beat them out of them right away.
They must be shown immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and anyway it's seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the center without their family, men stay in tents, lean-ands and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking distances in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða area, a large hub of human smuggling, people are dying tired.
Goran's Kyytes are mainly Syrian, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their business once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like it.
A fool fool all the way.
First, for example, a price of 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works at a lower price than others and charges only 50 euros on the Hungarian border from a person.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most of the comfortably motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or fourfold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros per year.
That's not a large sum for the smuggler, but it's quite a nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points the right direction for his clients and shines away.
At the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolesman is called Missionary, and it is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, with a lot of believers who fled Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear elegantly peeks under the low waist of the jeans.
Missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hide the money squeakly, and slip into the merchants crossing the border.
To get the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from, for example, North Kivu war zones, and that violence has been forced to flee their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
It is helped by Missionary contacts with Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: leaving an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, in a European country, €4,500-7,000.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 on the motorway and trying to avoid the police.
If police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would be directly jailed for arranging illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants, he's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to the rest site where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - we have to make sure it's just on its way to England and not to Holland, for example, and cut off the protective cover safety wire.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the business is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped in the kitchen around a frying or oven potato.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from noticing the hideer.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver won't snap lightning strikers, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporika, the Turk has been called the Marketing Champion and the undisputed king of illegal invasions in the Mediterranean, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money to arrive.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented a yacht to take American or European families to nice few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded into crowded Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of €5,000-7,000 first from Istanbul by land to a port and from there by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for these to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere facing the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When given, you have to board quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about 53,000 euros after the cost of one luxury vessel trip.
He does not handle practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller factors to do the work in turn.
At least hundreds of transports are held during the summer season and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 simultaneously with a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he's apparently missing.
Correction 16 September 2015 at 3:10: Death Travel agency book will be published here, not next week.
American Olympic runner tells about his illness and becoming a prostitute in his book
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-meter runner who competed three times at the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about ending her career and drifting into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top condition and ran in the pruns for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top from the beginning and defended his leadership position with a manic run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his powers ran out.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and the other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with foreign men.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's tax was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanation in becoming a prostitute was that he needed the adrenaline spikes similar to that he had been competing in athletics.
Favorite Hamilton later found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was evident in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1,500 metres in the world's statistical one time of 3.57.40, but was the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski cock under control: "Direct back"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of appropriateness in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the athlete contract all summer and autumn last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the world champion and Olympic champion either.
The Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was praised by double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union put the ski flowers under control.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season from the national team so he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations, and does not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own release on Tuesday, in which he said he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colors next season in the World Cup as well as then at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in total, two of which are golden.
He was involved in Falun's team last winter.
Baking translators' day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the day of the shield on 25 September, stunts will be held in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Baking Translators' Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants checked and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa at restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant participates in Kokkola.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland will continue to remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre was carried to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-space currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure of crisis time in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, i.e. Suomen Eriklisalvets Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to a private individual, the placement of the reception centre in the same building package would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
The complainant said the armed forces may have interests in connection with the former Air War School area and airport, the impact of which has not also been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case states that for the past two years, negotiations have been held for Kauhava Airport to organise flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Secretary of Staff of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of principled opposition from the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava City Board discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to journalists during the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties with their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concerns about managing the refugee situation combined all participants.
He considers it valuable that government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and Russian and US action in the region may also have an impact on the situation of Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also ignored in discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closed for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Fridays.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia says that the operations of airports are being handled during the work stoppage by supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of the centre of Helsinki
The demonstration, which will be held on Friday, will close the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
Police say that the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars from about 9:30 a.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahtinkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Union Street from Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unionnkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police say the closing period depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The tram and metro staff association told the STT this evening.
Most of the beginnings close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Posti's services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of day mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
Blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is handled despite the strike.
Meal transport, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples, are also being treated.
Situational information about the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alps will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam, the service industry trade union, has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 o'clock and 13 o'clock.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to participate in a demonstration of trade unions.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores are kept open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information on the possible closure of individual stores yet.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Helsinki day care centres do not operate in full extent on Friday, Helsinki's Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration of trade unions, day care is potentially concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities of day care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and with multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are normally organised.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, a wide range of channels are needed in communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often repeated the Prime Minister's television and radio talks become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be transmitted on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight," Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious as to require television and radio talk to the public.
This whole thing, which is now being talked about, is quite complex and requires a longer argument.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured out.
The speech will be sent from 9:05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television speech does not tell us about the more common government inwards.
Is there an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into one's own hands and to refuse questions from public debate?
Reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda or let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues will not be interrelated.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant from Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not announcements in a democracy.
It is up to media representatives by definition to try not to take the agendas of politicians when given.
According to Koivunen, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more to offer today what we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, differently, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense if it is not a special situation but routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled a media between politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or general line.
A clever bet from Sipill
In the forthcoming speech of Sipilä, what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher stresses.
In the evening, you should look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and where not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, the TV speech is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring out its own vision without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a general public without a journalistic filter, unlike a briefing event, where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about speech, because more specific questions cannot be asked.
Six says it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV - a drain sweat, whether your hands tremble.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do its business well, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform something, because here a person is talking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and partners are doing regularly.
Really exceptional
Politics researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public as truly exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmail ahead.
Employees' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) announces that he will challenge Sipilä's dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Soon six months from the election.
You can't hide endlessly, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a runaway has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
POIKA IS FOUNDED AND IN TODAY, the boy's father updated to his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out at 4:00 this afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped to search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent fad of young people: You bring about anger
Kurdish-based free fighter Makwan Amirkhani released a video on Facebook, which appeals especially to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against young street fighting.
Born in Iran and arrived at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to watch an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the youth fad.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick the ground, sit on the other, and beat without thinking about any of these consequences this will have when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people visible in the videos are with an immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from native Finns.
It's exactly that you fight on the street in the head.
You make so many other immigrants more difficult to live here in Finland, Amirkhani, Turku reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that seek crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come into a very gross number.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get to be the target of racism, you are allowed to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives contributions to racism.
You make me hate that I don't like myself.
You're doing things pretty bad anyway and that thing you don't cure them at all," Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The staff centre organisation STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to reach the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes the government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
SAK President Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open a labour market lock", and that agreements concluded by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social agreement was not good enough for SAK.
Sipilä earlier cut off negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity leap target.
Comment: A big demonstration threatens to go away - "It feels a little funny to put a fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake a fist if there is already a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary from side to side in the employee camp.
Is the government to go down or agree with it?
On Monday, SAK's federal leaders burst into sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to catch.
The threat spread to the Akavas as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened with the closure of schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten is closed completely.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the Authority Centre Association STTK, performed in a conciliatuous manner.
He said he kept in touch with the government and drafted an alternative proposal required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) for a 5% productivity leap.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to indicate that his compromise is already complete.
At first, there was no yard from SAK's office.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint presentation of wage earners, SAK should yield to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palolan STTK has relations with the Sipilä Board.
Palola's right hand, Jukka Hauus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to central city centre prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described that the government's ay-knowledge has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit out of the Finnish stoppers, which are fronted by Marko Piirainen (sd) of the ACP.
It feels a little funny to put a fist if there's already a settlement paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, spokesman for the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the Speaker of the Russian Duma, felt that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July Helsinki Festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the European Union's forced Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting - an issue that the President could remind journalists.
Our estimate is that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also to the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation reached uncomplicated, so Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary general assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who leads the meeting in Ulan Bator, who has already discussed with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock meets a real playoff troll: "The paints in tight"
The killer and the Lock continue bull days in Haka Forest today as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that today there will be no actual paint parties in Hakametsä.
The killer went to Kuopio yesterday to drill a 3-2-time win from KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at worst from the loss position of two goals.
Tuesday in the lock was more moll-winning.
The Blues, which started the Rauman catch, was a round zero points, and the loss readings also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
The killer has dropped in the previous two seasons just from the Luko final series.
Both times the solution has been required for a decisive seventh game.
Last season, Lukko took the series into a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three sides and past.
Apart from goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the group configurations.
Both of the cashiers who rejected yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
With the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Point of View: A lousy play going on in the Ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film, in which she himself played the lead.
The adversator sent a sensational struggle for heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a troubled cinderella story in Pori.
An anonymous and wood-handed pot pot advanced to everyone's astonishment to the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori Matt, and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Hope became blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the defeated silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Screenplay by Toivola believes that this season's new work will work the same way as ten years ago.
A man working as the sports director of the Aces has built a pot on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in a trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copperen's merits are in some other than puck playing.
Toivola has forgotten that Rocky VI will play the lead by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy in Rocky written by Toivola as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work.
There's nothing but a nickname in the Iron Rock.
Iron Rock's philosophy of game does not include rushing and petty boaring.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Ässien Garrett tackled Tappara on the head of Jere Karelia.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the ace puck, the hot-running Iron Rock came to the people of Satakunta after the game.
The team of this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, police officers, and villains.
There are practically no key men in the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill deficit.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited, Rautakallio responded diplomatically.
Under the surface, the squat.
In 1953, Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola's site as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is as many losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulna ex-basist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under the guidance of Tuuka for the first time.
Olga's role in Apulana's early years is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemps and supports his son, although his father Risto (who is portrayed by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting the role to me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have converged a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through their history from a lot of different corners.
Fortunately, cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the 90s, there was a recession and really dreary.
There was a rather small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that he had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have been a little different sometimes.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola's infamous skate story, the well-known Tuuka.
Olga was a daily and a kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At most, he could have secretly fell in love.
Olga says he has worked so much with Tuuka in the past 10 years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team leaves for a month to shoot in Heinola.
However, a couple living in Iit often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over the whole Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, just asked what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play film in Finland with a budget of €17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has been on Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also rise past Iron Sky 2 after graduation, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming of the film directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa will begin in October near Antwerp at AED Studios premises and last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will go to Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what kind of movie should be.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I am more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he tells Iltalehti.
Originally, 8-10 million had been planned to be the film's budget, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big stallion too.
However, 100 million could be stuffed into the film, because each angle and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is so tight that there is no loose.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond today, which will pay an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
In two years later, the company will repay the loan.
The action film features Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' breasts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Some time ago, a fashion conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or T-shirt was seen somewhat as a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become the right fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the wave of coolness.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurred: if something is already a real junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. tavismune, where trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as possible as if as a way to separate yourself from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, the net shirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, for example, Adidas' recognizable track covers, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees clips have made a comeback to street fashion.
The beginning of the jeans edge of the underwear's Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace's autumn blouses makes it clear what brand the garment is all about.
Would you be willing to show logos in your dress?
Russian politician published evidence: I didn't get stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
The claims suggest that a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presents Russian war industry products, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything possible to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be peeking from the hatch of the armored vehicle in quite good moods, and at least not based on their images, it's about getting stuck or angry.
Full nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was a assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
For the Russian Army TV channel Zotov explained that he admired Russia's new technology in the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show, I will definitely go to all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the fool of the journalist who wrote it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but there's anything like I was stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen, he said to Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stuck have been published, although a total of 50,000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The claim of Zotov's stuck originally started with a story on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov was told to hang out the tank hatch in an attempt and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him unless he gets out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story where the exhibition organizers told their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he was by no means sitting there for five hours, said Aleksandr Pisarevsky, coordinator of the exhibition to Bloknot.

10 points on the effects of Friday stop on you - watch the video!
The demonstration of trade unions will be held at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 13, but the strike will affect the lives of citizens for a much longer period of time - all the day and even beyond.
ISTV explained with 10 points how Friday stop affects citizens.
Watch the video for the impact of work stoppages on road and rail transport - both in the transport of goods and passengers.
Air transport is its own figure.
The strike operations are badly over at least around noon, but the reflections will continue until Saturday.
What about schools and kindergartens?
Police and fire department?
Grocery stores, Alkots and mail delivery - not to mention factories and ports?
There may be changes to the details of strike information before Friday.
The Ilta Sanoma website keeps you informed.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called enrichment sand pool to the ditch.
The company said measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment and purified process water in the foaming process.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as process water or managed as permission through the surface cast field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company says the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material flowed into the environment.
The leak was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the International Monetary Fund, largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland to comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime compensation and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there are agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates have a lot of sympathetic message for government action, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Talousomas.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske today anticipates that growth will remain on zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the latest observations as the basis.
This morning Statistics Finland said that total production was growing in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
Less attention has been paid to industry's weakened trust or other so-called softer metrics.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start her work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimisha is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to monitor Iwata footprints, said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research.
Kimishima is tasked with taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that up to hundreds of children who have entered the country will disappear each year.
This has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear in the country each year.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- A total of 156 minor asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11, of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The disappearance may be driven by the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to process the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing are also found later when they seek asylum in another member country.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of which were subject to a lapse decision because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the past 123 years, he says.
Is the number growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 minor asylum applications that came alone.
There are no total statistics on the low-age asylum seekers lost this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have received a conversion decision?
Do they also disappear to the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of proselyse decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Home Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing crowd of unregistered countries.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who considered refugee issues at the EU Ministerial Conference, announced on Monday practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen's equipment for TV and radio productions, which lost their ability due to the illness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which were once the most advanced professional tools in his field.
The online announcement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamacasi.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer used for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are interested.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of his own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move out of their current Myrskylä home.
We can't take all the amount of goods with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what stuff is being given up.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no more own use for TV and radio equipment.
After guaranteed strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was already archived at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited a box of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams today decide whether to expand power measures in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it is solved whether traffic stops all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, Chief Trust Officer, says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts are very stinging drivers, so the government's plans to cut lizards are resisting.
Hirvonen wonders that stopping traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop for Friday, public transport is virtually completely stagnant in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
VR reports say trains do not run on Friday between 6 a.m. and 6 a.m.
On Friday, there is no local or long-distance traffic.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain on the pit.
ACP members are off work on Friday from three a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Most likely, a small number of buses can be driven by supervisors, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo says.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus shifts will run on Friday.
The employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11-13 a.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, the AP reports.
Sky News said refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
Local media said Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas - teacher thought self-made watch is a bomb
Ahmed Mohamed, 14-year-old, in Texas, has been arrested after the teacher considered the self-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
Police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to the youth arrest cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said the clock looked like a "film bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished for three days on forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council wonders whether the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is buzzing - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the emerging press has also joined Corbyn's own Labour party MPs.
This has offended the people, thought Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service was honored by the British Air Force pilots against Luftwaffe, Germany in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has paid tribute to pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
Corbyn's election as a party leader has shared Labour ranks.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear him to expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled for the first time today to appear as party leader in Parliament during Question Time by the Prime Minister.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should be asked.
Cameron hung on Twitter Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, financial security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family murder still unclear - family father was waiting for a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a week of family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting with a shotgun, his wife and three children Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for a check-up and found a huge house dead for the Short family from all over.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still underway.
The motive for blood acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors to the site weekly.
I have made 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected in the fact that the Short family bought a huge house in Greenwood for $2 million in 2011.
The house is advertised at the real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The lawsuit pending
According to StarTribune, the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to the Achieve Test Prep, Short had not removed comments that blasphemous prep courses had been removed, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffees
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month Award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented on his good mood of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with his win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work when working with a horse, according to Loir.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'll keep my ass kicked, Loiri slumped.
NHL star's amazing gesture - "The biggest athlete donation ever made"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital statement, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed an agreement with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million year earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped significantly local hospitals before.
Longtime Captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars to the same children's hospital and Saku Koivu collected a giant amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
A Japanese café can be ordered for a wife's evening - serves food just bikini and pig on top
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe on the market, a rabbit cafe, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife cafe.
It strikes lonely, club pains, and hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
A Tokyo-based Ore no Yome can be ordered for a wife or husband's night.
It is a waitress who pretends to be the client's spouse.
"Half" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is up against just a pig and bikini wearing, the husband in tight cycling shorts again.
The website provides all the information about the length of the wife candidates and always puts pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field, a statement published by Intel.
The board consists of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best cybersecurity practices.
The company will update the report based on ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
ASRB allows Intel to establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes the ASRB Board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs about 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected for years like the moon to rise.
Finally, the car is also in sight in Finland.
Ford announced RS information now that the automotive world's gaze is at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower engine, from 4.7 seconds to zero to 100 and a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The price is also interesting in Finnish, it is provisionally reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
The favorite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
More important than the two novelties in Finland is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Founded with the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, Sportage is rounder than before.
A cent has come to the axle spacing and outdoor dimensions here and the car splits the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo that develops horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to going on sale.
We still have to wait a little bit, as we will have a new Sportage in spring 2016.
Even before the change of year, the new Kia Optimats reached our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of higher middle-class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are started.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time, Optima Farmar begins with its arrival.
Chisu returned to the stage - blinked in a brave overall outfit
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pants suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the singer star's graceful waist.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer, has been able to lose the pounds of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon turn a year.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Back to the stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break, I'm not really nervous.
I've missed all the music-related things, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release its new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is stunned again - now you can see the chest
True TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics one after another.
She presents her pregnancy stomach and breast equipment readily in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one American time when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian's gig with her sister Kourtney Kardashian.
The black maternity dress is transparent to breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress when flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York City just a couple of days ago.
The apartment was highlighted by black overgeneration boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnancy bed on the presentation shift.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the notion that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (Speaking dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouth clean about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the previous season you have bounced in top designers' outfits, the new season starts again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come to the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and a mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one sort of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but it's then said in Paris you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time serve as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the difference is sore.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with some role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band in the early years of the Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulana in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist about 26 years old, and in this movie I play 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the right Antti before the shoots because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's all right that I'm just learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to make an impression on a person.
A man who pilots the empty Scrooge Salminen and Dogs does not leave the role.
Punk manicures come naturally with the man.
In the punk period of stars, stars, many saw a foretaste, as have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been a little wing, we always go to the fullest.
The main actors in the film Tukka Temonen, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass, were announced today.
The band, which has become familiar to the public, is still performed by quite unknown young actors to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told him that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already released a picture of her new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge seen in a mustache and chin beard has shaved his face into smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to Tell Children About Refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe in recent days.
Or is it worth telling about it at all?
There is no need to raise this by force, advises a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Smaller children are worth protecting, for example, and not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard of it elsewhere, it is worth bringing up.
It is good to have a conversation from the child's starting point and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
It is not worth scaring the child in vain, even if you are distressed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors their parents' behavior.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to bring it up with them if it is a matter of thinking about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing things well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how to deal with this in our family.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety if possible.
On the other hand: If you also talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
The ball flash that strikes the blood is difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone the Apila Ball Salama to the blow in midsummer.
It only broke profits and second positions until at the end of July, a collapse came in the Tampere raves.
Because the stallion was thoroughly chilled, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his shelter from the vet for the time.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear at the look.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest end, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Because Apila Ball Flash had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says it is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE-tre in Turku after the legend wind.
Apila Ball Flash was under great pressure from the break when it could have been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a small tendency at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a decent competition made a blade for the stallion.
The horse's tune certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would have levelled off as well.
Apila Ball Flash has been so-called humor horses.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, the stallion has been removed from the stallion that opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, fellow competitors can't handle the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm blood rides.
The Nordic wishes have a nest run in Vermo.
The different thing, however, is how Apila's Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's pretty difficult at the time of departure and may even take a swing from under the starting car boom and stuff.
I hope the stallion would be calmer than Turku leaving.
Apila Ball Flash is also able to come out of the bow while in order, and we go drive for the win with it, the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be removed sometime in the future - but not quite everyone.
Apple plans to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, said Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Lehtkioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complex than it looks like.
Some apps are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
Cook said Apple is investigating, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only scarce in August, or 0.1% from one year ago, the EU statistical authority Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rates were 0.2%.
The so-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate for base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper last month than one year ago.
In the whole of 28 countries, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The most in the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, consumer prices rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus mark according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Eurozone inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a 2% price rise in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area for this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
US Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed takes a long time to raise its interest rates again.
And in the financial markets, on the other hand, begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it would possibly start interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can turn on at its fastest by next autumn and the financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they have been the custom - and if they react to the extortion of the Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have come to the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle study.
The bank distributed over 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and report do not think they know exactly when the Fed will raise its interest rates or what happens in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, they present, through cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and markets have previously behaved at and after the Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may result from it.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
Maybe not a year at the beginning of the recession
The leaders who decide the Fed's monetary policy and its respective tuning have suggested that time is starting to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate purchase in more than nine years can come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Directors of the Fed meets to decide on its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funs control rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but at a time of small 0.25 percentage point interest rates ended, with which the Fed increased its interest from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the most risky housing funding difficulties in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversity in financial markets and the real economy began more slowly than since previous Fed interest rates typically occurred.
Similarly, trials were tougher and harsher than once since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche strategists have screened the rise and declines in the world's largest economies, as well as the turnarounds of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts, they make reports since the 1950s.
It has been less than one year since the first interest rate purchase, most often less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The financial market rate increase has ended within one year to two of the start of the Fed interest rates.
The Fed has increased and alternately lowered its key interest rate by a dozen different length cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has deviated in some respects from others, and the narrator is relatively scarce in the review, so they can hardly conclude anything from the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies remind us that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits may not be unquestionably discovered even through decades of research.
But three of the reasons that led the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other world's largest central banks in the 21st century considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up traces of techno bubble, and at the same time raised the following.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in the various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and even too high increased by central banks' over-finding monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history was born until then.
3) In particular, the insane debt financing, which has been packed in financial finances, which was nearly subsidized, in most aspects of financial markets, was inflated by the largest exchange bubbles in economic history from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It also hardly creates a very severe dispute that the financial markets that rose to heights on increasingly complex leverages were unusually dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove up interest rates.
Financial structures tuned to debt leverage, let alone valuation bubbles, could only last their time after interest rates had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned to rise.
Risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists don't guess what will happen next, but give cause for the breeze by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept the stance of their monetary policy even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower even longer.
2) Debt has not been crazy for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not lightened, but now in different parts of the economy, there is a heavyer debt load than before or to the financial crisis ever before.
3) The liquidity that has been issued from central banks more and less frequently has remained in financial markets and curbed key securities and assets most expensive since the peak prior to the financial crisis or ever.
And strategs are not just flatten by financial market warning signs, but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession to the model that has happened before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition but, respectively, the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money taps to a tighter.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, the French bank Societe Generale's strategy, is not as strange as it can be.
He has been coaching the bank's international investor customers for the next turnaround of the Fed for the next turnaround:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for the Fed to shut down financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted at HP's corporate service side, the company says.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had a maximum number of personnel in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records the non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (about €2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be deducted from 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Consumer side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
The year before yesterday, its three most significant customers brought 65 percent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System for iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, click "General" and then select "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation when the "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush hour to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests applications to be deleted and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the update that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it can lead to a breach of the update.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (center) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, so-called tax planning is related to the company's operations.
It is a Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, to which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says he has submitted a resignation from membership in May this year.
I checked it and that's enough to file a resignation notice.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger, Kährs' Board of Directors and Luxembourg.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings pass through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership in the Luxembourgish company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture capitalist with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company's capital.
It is important that we ensure that the capital income of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, Triton, had a Luxembourg-based holding company already ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today since 6 p.m.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on the security arrangements of the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares an alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the tightening of the government's working life.
The organization also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out during a break from the organization's administration meeting to journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, has no readiness for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to the other side of the package of 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party has a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if you have one to 100 on the side.
Palola: Negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a conversational connection to the government, and it has been constructive for him all along.
According to Palola, the staff centre organisation STTK, surgery is a painful place, according to Palola.
The organization requires the government to retreat from mandatory legislation to implement some of the blackmail.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to preparing an alternative package with the SDP that held the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work-life blackmail package presented by the Board last week.
As part of the package, e.g. the salary of the first sick days is cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
STTK stresses that central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration and the intention has not been to arrange a strike.
Akava Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of preparing an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming to the same lines as Akava, as an alternative model for the government's performances has been outlined in Akava for longer.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join us in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitiveness leap sought by the government in the country as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government performances.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the government and employers of the country together," Fjäder says.
Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, leot" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
The University of Tampere Green Left
Bingo coupon of the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's canals on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister in holding a famous radio talk that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen stopped the strike of train performers with a television speech.
Single call, monarchist vibes
Sipilä's speech has sparked criticism and guessing all day about what's to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give its speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a Prime Minister's announcement, which would also allow the speech to be discussed."
According to Greens Ville Niinistö, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist vibes: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it."
SDP chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "A little six months from the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What is @juhanipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for presenting Sipilä's speech.
We considered this and stated that it is a public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, the line Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications in the news.
Like We in the Time of Tammelas
The speech has also sparked grotes.
When the evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are terrified and dressed at their best.
Mom puts on a pretty lot and Dad ties the tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., let's shut down to the TV than before in ancient times Me Tammela," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell why the Finnish government is serving millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claim that the people have to be cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
For what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has released the bingo accompanying on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, common coal, debt, and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to bring Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to give up the power in style after a while.
However, the West did not seize the proposal because they believed al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be contacted immediately and the abandonment of al-Assad had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree with all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sitting Down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he has conveyed Thurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Thurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the magazine, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the British Foreign Ministry's Middle East Department, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Thurkin spoke with Moscow's authorization.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to hold power with some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee stream of our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no choice but to take good care of these broken people.
We are now paying the bill we caused ourselves," Ahtisaari says to the paper.
Asylum Seeker Arrangement Centre in Tornio
The government's planning centre for asylum seekers in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the building of the Tornio Co-Section, which is empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council had already decided to present the school building as a space solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice president of the Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not gathered and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will say to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted quickly.
The association would accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), halving holiday money in public would only handle part of the calculation of the labour price sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to receive an alternative package if labour market organisations manage to agree on such a thing.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for substitute means for the extortion of working life announced by the government.
If such a contract is made, we will of course welcome it as part of the overall package.
Sipilä believes that halving holiday money would be functional as a means, because it would be directed at almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned Sunday supplements surgery.
Labour market organisations could agree with each other on the cut of holiday money because they are recorded in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will report to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the extortion of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
The final deadline is not either.
Legislation is then moving, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more and more difficult.
It's a great time now.
It will not take long in such matters, if there is a will, Sipilä formulated.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, turning the Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime compensation is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and the holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as mandatory legislation past trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
The employees' centre organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves expansion of mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved the expansion of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, i.e. Mahlahalli warehouse.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than had originally been said.
Also a busy schedule heartily.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
The agenda was still talking about the investment of €150,000 to €200,000, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at €300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous steep position to bring Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct with regard to the preservation of Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use in Karelian language, for example in info boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
Karelian is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of them can be well used in the many kinds of marketing in the province.
The closures of train connections cut the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the province's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether we can live and work here at all," Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air traffic, the continuation of which has also been in the report on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that our chances are not reduced by state power measures, as is now taking place.
One should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of access connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect a research that is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that already marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult because the transport connections are weak in transversely.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, on the other hand, about 10-20% are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one gravel voice for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voice is among them.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the city government (sd., in the picture), presented a waiver of the entire project at the board Monday meeting, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Board approved the final proposal by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although less than one train-shifter.
There will be changes to passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train inning is left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money for train traffic by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will set up new schedules by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, guys slipped out of the scene
The rescue services let a 12-year-old climbed the roof of the climb, who couldn't get down the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki at 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that other slipped out of the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to the site to help the last one who was left on the roof safely back to the surface.
FedEx's operating profit twofold, lowers tax year 2016 outlook
FedEx reports depressing results in its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services, and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May as $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came despite the average price increases of 4.9%, which will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for the land transport of heavy or large parcels.
The company said it expects operating profit to grow from the previous year because they have cut expenses, turnover has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company " is firmly implementing, taking into account the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS reported that he plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The win per share came at $2.42, which is left by the $2.44 average forecast. A 12 analysts survey was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transportation in recent years, which has halted the development of its Express unit's turnover.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the latest quarter, the country unit's net sales rose by 29 per cent, but the revenue from the operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
Express unit revenue was better due to higher basic payments, while operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 percent on Tuesday to decline for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
The decision-makers of the Federal Reserve are sitting for two days around a huge mahogany table this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
One end of the central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
Congress has put two-sided responsibility on the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a crucial factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from a record incentive that has brought the short-term interest rate level that remained almost zero in late 2008 .
While most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made central bank officials that are already on guard in advance, as far as increasing instability, fearing how it would affect if the federal funds rate reference value were increased even by a percentage point by a quarter.
"Intelligibly, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economic Specialist at the brokerage company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they seek justification for restoring interest rates, increased uncertainty on the world market is a valid enough reason to wait," he says.
No agreement has been reached on the central bank's decision, which too creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers were then able to soften the attack by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new number of 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, a chief economy expert in the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If decision makers raise interest rates, "they need to go to a lot of trouble in their policy to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts claim that an elevated level would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates this month by a quarter percentage unit, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the state of monetary finances that would verify the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the central bank's decision-makers say the main reason for this is a significantly temporary impact on the price of lowered oil.
The economy "clears even higher interest rates and also needs them, taking into account the tight situation in the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, the main economy expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial market around the world was shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16 percent of its record in May when investors feared China would slow down the economy as well as global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the top in May.
For central bank decision makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that indicates because interest rates should be increased.
"Without these financial market events and the news of recent weeks about the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and have little information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China," Olier says.
The well-being of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, an hint that the central bank could "crow" an increase in the amount of money caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow the development elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, Head of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted the financial market movement that has seemed to be separate from the fundamental economic elements."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which is making decisions, has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a member entitled to vote, calls for an example to the 1998-99 decisions.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritise economic stability during a major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's interest rate determination committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come near its level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants to be in a situation where interest rates are feared because the market will be upset," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual demand, and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian pediatric organization in Rio Grande advertises a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake with about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven channel's Sunrise program is a favorite in ratings, despite Nine channel's attempts to report on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader revelation failed to increase Today's ratings.
Nine's morning show was sent from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull derailed Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, derived from David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of the distance did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average viewer was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been catching Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far, during September, Sunrise's average is 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The winds are blowing this morning even in other parts than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven's big news was the 800 word series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
A new drama series, which garnered the average of a fairly impressive 1,219 million viewers, reports a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the power of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a two-way fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz program hosted by Andrew O'Keee collected 446,000 spectators in the middle.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - a small enough victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour spectators was 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour figure was a whopping 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night viewer average decline brings confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers in McGuire's program.

The final trio agrees that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markosk could accidentally reveal who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with which Sam Wood ends up at The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip out who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women threw themselves poetic when they told how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning her sense of humor, ambition, family value and positivity as reasons why they would like to be her partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?", their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markkoski quickly cited Mackay as the best alternative to Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked in to the house, the energies and Sam's energies seemed quite compatible, and that idea was in my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visit meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with all my heart in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls left as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested since he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose the San Francisco 49ers, as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after how this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first plane kick return as the team won 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next plane kick and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true nature was also reflected in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the plane kick captured by Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of play
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for the man's NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told the Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when the feed in his own paint area led to Queensland's finish line.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo posted on his Instagram account with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint, threatening the Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed when police shoot rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets in a crowd that demonstrated against the country's new constitutional proposal, the official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandesh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the area's top official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous option seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was in the latest weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern Nepalese republics, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed by a devastating earthquake in April.
This week, legislators have voted on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
On a wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second precise low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google to start donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign aimed at raising $11 million to humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who come to Europe as they escape war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it released a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being notified by a director, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven, was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are made by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it will respond to every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, with the total target of $11 million.
Europe has the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
A new study found that the benefits of mildly obese type 2 diabetics from weight loss surgery can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live after a weight loss surgery longer than those treated in ways other than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Losing weight, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, medicinal treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut individuals fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29.
36% of the people cut improved diabetes completely and 28% partially.
By comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "are generally better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
The researchers also followed patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels that reflect blood sugar levels in the long run.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control" described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group of gastric reduction surgery, a group of gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more than its body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased higher than hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7%).
Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had taken a weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower probability of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with BMI under 35 and interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for a lower body mass index group," and it does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the time the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to cancel the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama claimed that in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that, although Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's actions in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousands of refugees, but in the meantime, long-term solutions are forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their lands.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response in the United States caused the chain's violent events.
"After 9/11-Isku, I presented my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, swallowing the hand desinfect in children has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in swallowing a strongly alcoholic hand disinfection agent for children under 12 years of age after 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Information Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant swallowing reported in poison control centres for children under 12 years of age rose from 3266 cases in 2010 to 16117 cases.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will be on call," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap rise hum.
Reports say teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (handets) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-smelling disinfectants that are very attractive to children's opinion.
Hand disinfectant can contain alcohol between 45 and 95%.
Especially in young children, only a few ryees are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Center for Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey soot lying on the table, but the hand desinfectioner is left visible, and if children get interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four whips of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to first aid for treatment.
His blood alcohol levels were .179, twice as high as the limit for adult drunk driving, says first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed when he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head," Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfection towels and move the disinfectant out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two lucky women died after swallowing a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "evil" teachers by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, a police report reports.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
Police must prevent the plan as a "flexible nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor mill: Celtic has no contradictions
Griffiths discredits speeches about Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but she makes it turn
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football Association for Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard for January recruitments that can disrupt team unity
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodris Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference in Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays speeches about contradictions
Rumors have arisen about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under a closer eye as the team is preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
Lack of Scots championship bore the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "In Holland, there are no more highlights of Celtic games and why?"
Because the Rangers are not involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and non-Scotlantians also want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
Losing to Malmö and the fall from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat for Aberdeen, who played ten men, which is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to go on.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is on guard for January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on any targets for January player transfers, he is on guard for the recruitment frenzy, affirming that he does not want to confuse consensus with the crowd.
Former Brentford boss said, "The stunt transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the adjustment time is the previous time throughout, which will be reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can make more trouble.
Celtic's interest Michu hints about retirement
Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts ready to fight Scottish Football Association for Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was the third red card condemned by Columbus over the past eight months to be overturned.
Neilson remains behind his message, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to sing an offensive song from former Hearts player Rudi Skace.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim of a moment," the attacker said, adding, "It's safe to say I won't go back to Tynecastle unless I move on to play Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes Dundee United is in charge of Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' weakening must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes is delighted with the "ug win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately hanging in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, succeeded in achieving his seventh consecutive league win, which brought them to the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that wouldn't have also won games in this way."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's total population increases
EMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained in 164,000 people between May and July, while unemployment in the entire UK rose to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% is higher than the UK's 5.5%, figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS) report.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed people is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Prove a Execution in Oklahoma
If no legal intervention occurs, later today I will see when the man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope no, I'll sit in a spectators' gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison to see Richard Glossip executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to be terrified this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the media-booked positions from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen looks at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through calls during the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from the occult accused me on Twitter that I have compromised on my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose for the reporter.
He admitted that "you could have laid his word better," but it still thinks what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he says.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, Huffington Post reporter, is by my side.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I won't go through all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of help anyway.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he has not committed murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence justifying the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the point of view from which I look at him die.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I have a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like dies unnecessarily.
Man lured off Canning River after watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract policemen from their heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just feet away from a police man who tried to "attract him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday due to unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come get me'," said senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said senior Sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He failed to try, but inspired locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's officials tried to infiltrate his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatain's late rejection due to the treatment measure on race day was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that her goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that she has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue under control over spy allegations for a year and a half, and he didn't want to "it look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and sleeping well.
I want to go up with my head and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to continue as a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which she told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his team.
"A half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - the name when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should really fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Modie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the matter at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man and perhaps shift responsibility to non-coachers for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I say now may make them think just that.
But I'm at the point now that I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach frustration has grown with a long-term Lidar cobalt study, and late rejection prompted him to state that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the invincible champion Black Caviar, has called the rule on the day's treatment measures to be "laughs" after mud or clay is put at the feet of the horse, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition day due to the grave treatment of the race day, where the officials started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver guilty of traffic in Cobram arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic force after running into a cyclist this weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after receiving serious injuries when a car collided with him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia himself reported to police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks competitors on wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the master popular claims of two NRL rubby leagues that his team's tackles would be part of a "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "press" on their own side when it unexpectedly won the final qualifying in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualifying. Bennett called the game a rugby league "samp window" and said that two Queensland teams were not "hardly enthusiastic" wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that her confidence was increased by two leading coaches' criticism of Storm, as that means they're afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year, and over the past six weeks, we've just stressed contact in tackles, and it's made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "top".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He considered it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and to tell you how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team capable of playing rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of players.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - there are no friends on every team like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play like that.
I become more confident when they say things like this because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more do than played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it a breaking an exciting line of defense and not making a goal?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm has time off this weekend because they have already won the right to home game either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla against the Sharks for next Saturday night's prefinals in AAMI Park. Tickets will be available next Tuesday morning.
Serbimies bail of $200,000 on drug charges
A man threatened with a potential life sentence of 40 kg of cocaine smuggling in Queensland has been released against a $200,000 guarantee.
Marko Maximovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracking 100 pounds of drug to Solay yachts, which entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in August to Coomera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused people at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of drug in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened by a potential life sentence for holding the amount of cocaine for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he could be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal court case, Maximovic lied to police about the place he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had together offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure her release.
"After reading the sworn certificates of both people, it is clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was guaranteed on the condition that he handing over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily, and maintains his curfew between 6 p.m. and six a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her while she slept and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When the police came, the police saw five images, searched the computers on the site, and found "careful" web searches with keywords used to search for obscene images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the internet before "presenting that he was a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundeen Sheriff Court the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he depends on scaring people.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on the computer but said they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him pictures, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send further photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said he was sick after drinking, and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When she found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the immoral photos on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old living on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty of making or taking pictures of obscene children on June 14 last year. He violated his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to come to the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to enter the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the verdict until October so that social welfare has time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was guaranteed in this case, but in other cases in progress, he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of judgment.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives wrong speech to parliament
Africa's oldest leader Mugabe fell earlier this year at the stairs leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to boo to Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with intermediate screams as he gave a speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, supervisor of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The genius from which the message was sent does not answer, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant members that immunity will end in Parliament and when they step out, parliamentary immunity is not in force.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "handling" of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and expense cutting efforts in the corporate service business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster growing corporate equipment and service operations.
Expected job cuts bring about $2.7 billion in expenses starting from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than modernHP, and we will have a wide range of services that will help companies move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our opportunity to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it will "focus on producing non-peer integrated technology solutions" to companies," the company said in a statement.
The division breaks down a company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduates from Stanford University in the 1930s to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto called the "The birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that he is running his rehabilitation as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be attending the European Championship next summer.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he has had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger admitted, as the player tries to return in the middle through there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, in the last five seasons, he has played Arsenal's 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider package since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight, it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury can be a prone period when you have to strengthen the body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am sure that will happen, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be started.
Wenger can also put Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a respite to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear extension favorite of Block F, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to win its first European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than women.
The company tackles the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 men's year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 upper school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, the ability of a person to recover doubled if a percentage of his friends were "healthy mood".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were halved in the likelihood of developing potential mental health problems if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this social media through communication time, the style goes past the content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of the inner longing - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get any greater happiness.
The fineness of the frides was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in nice chairs watching football, Ross misses Rachel - their humor came from being aware that yes, men can identify with all this, even though they often hesitate to fully study their feelings.
As a volunteer from Samaritans explained to me: ..."When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can improve being."
Often men who contact us feel they cannot talk to friends.
The old thought of "over getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up with problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term ways of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my impartial, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why don't you take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut, helping PSG bypass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started her Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in her Champions League debut, pointing the road to the French league champions, but the team lost several possibilities before finally added their head start as Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in the same A-block as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a follow-up place in the game, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the goal and later was changed from the field. Malmö is his old home town team and the team in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for your opponent and looks good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we have to work out this season," Blanc said.
This anticipates good.
We wanted to win and won, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two goals more.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after injury in one of the three changes made after the team was left in the 2-2 draw at Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but she was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's defense line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland at the back of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It won Celtic in a solution match when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense, and two players deep in the middle field.
But the team offered little more on the attack side but Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which passed the button by Kevin Trapp's goal post.
Instead, PSG was sometimes caught in trouble due to lost assists and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, which failed in five attempts in the first half alone and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing pre-work to his colleagues, and it was Di Maria that, from the feeding of Ibrahimovic, sent a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's paint pole at 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour after the game of the season thanks to the Uruguayan Cavan, which struck its sixth goal after Ibrahimovic had snapped Maxwell's cross-feed from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight from David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the Ezequiel Lavezzi goal from the exchange was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll pick up a hat for Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion with stock sales
The mining industry in Switzerland was left by Glencore, who suffered from a commodity price collapse, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a service that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
A company that lost 57% of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts pressure on demand and causes destruction in all markets.
The new entry brought the value of Glencore shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.6 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed $2.5 billion in stock trading the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital with 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4% discount at Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, worth 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing collapse of China's growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, and at the same time the prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement released by the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
Michelle Obama, the President of the United States and his wife, will hold a dinner for X and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of Parliament Xi will allow us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time it will allow President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues with disagreements," the laurise added.
The visit, first announced in February, Xin is also expected to deviate in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and X are expected to discuss numerous controversial topics, including Washington's concern regarding China's alleged online espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed a difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, an actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the black main character of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it is taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not the series," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted to the injured unbelievingly, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay," while The Martian's actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to urge people to think, whatever director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is the whore her white pimp hits.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights of directing the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon bluntly replied that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was sent, social media exploded to disapprove Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so good that it hurts."
Tweeting collected over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes after its release.
Damon's comments hit a time where an accurate racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread out nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the Album of the Year candidates as the Grammy Award.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement to answer Fox News's television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional rocker and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received a $1 million grand prize as a reward.
The competition programme, which has just ended its seventh term, has never had a competitor who would have survived all the sections of the obstacle track of the programme.
In the last episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task had to climb a rope of about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to figure out the 4th section of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock for winning the million dollar grand prize.
"It's great to think about this when I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden...I can't even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the fiina list with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor ever to manage to pass the track.
The rules say money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, you get the money with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels a grudge for it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth season, the filming of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers crept past the Minnesota Twins
MANNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season hasn't been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers was once one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played its role as a joker perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins on the 5-4 Target Field field.
Twins lost the chance to get half-game from Houston Astros in a race from another American League wild card location.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word, which had been very difficult to reach most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how to get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then once again in the sixth and more ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in the inning and let go three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for an exchange man to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first hit run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-stroke night after he hit Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks on the right side was discharged with a snap of one nest, and Simon was able to burn directly another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was switched to the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against, Miguel Sano, the novice substituter, who pulled the two nests to the left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and the leveling runner in second base, VerHagen got a third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the double-game ground.
It was the main series record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had received a backup run at the ninth start, Mauer pulled two beaten runs against Tigers closure Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three assists in his fifth salvation.
Detroit used Phil Hughes, rusty at the beginning.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being out of over a month due to lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want a start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I got a few nice assists in the third inning."
After Hughes caught the starter for the first nest, he allowed another nest player Ian Kinsler to proceed in one between.
The walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to batting, who took himself to first base with a midfield pilot and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes while the runners were in good running stations.
First base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in his attempt to proceed to third base.
The Tigers continued with the second inning and received one fire, two nests in the situation of the run from catcher James McCann and two fires, in one nest situation, running sensor Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the pitch and fed the unleaded third inning, after which he was replaced by A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs from six strokes and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was removed due to a swing on the shoulder of the throw hand.
He was examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people since mid-August due to shoulder swing, but was supposed to return on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was exchanged for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a real skewed abdominal muscle.
The three-game series of Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges opening the economy to the world more broadly
The economy must open more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said at the 16th meeting of the group leading to deepening general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are being driven forward with more new movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth," Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, the relaxation of border inspection principles, the call for state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
The opinion states that a negative list is created to name the sectors and companies that are not to be invested in.
The system is gradually tested and improved through pilot programs.
The change is considerable, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the statement states.
The government also loosens its control to the power it shares with companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation, as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
To open state-controlled sectors, more sectors open up to private financiers.
"The government does not exchange its policy regarding foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreign residents, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and lightening the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional exercise rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also attended the meeting, a statement published after the meeting.
