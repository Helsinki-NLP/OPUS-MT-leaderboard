Kuopio and Juankoski decide to implement the following municipal elections separately.
The next municipal election will be held in 2016.
After Juankoski's accession, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.

Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev's leadership on Monday for refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of his country," Putin said, according to the news agency Itar-Tassi.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and the West say are assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current places where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they cannot get the opportunity to shoot the people of the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi workshop.
It surprised the crowd came from the very early evening.
There were visitors as expected in two days, according to the promoter Tom Kangas.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, meaning there is no pop, Kangas assures.
A law will come into force in Finland on Tuesday that limits the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply for permission from the Police Board to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is found in cleaning and detergents, for example, but concentrations usually do not exceed limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in acceleration.
However, starting materials acquired before the Act enters into force may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel rape by Nairn and Pitlochry
The defendants of rape in two hotels are facing a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard charges at a hearing at the Glasgow Higher Court.
He is accused of rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman as "being in an unconscious state, sleeping, and being so unable to make a decision herself."

In accordance with Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will be held in Edinburgh on 17 November at the Supreme Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, who strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from its top green.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen pitches to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already taken the player's favorite expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotell in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotell, the tip of the midfield diamond Raheem Sterling, which poked the 3-0 win over the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with their power.
An Englishman 20 cents shorter than Balotelli is between the opponent's lines than a fish in water.
The feature is not common to a player who praises grass at its best at about 34 kilometers per hour.
Rodgers also deserves a great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irish told how Liverpool has systematically developed a player who grew at the foot of Wembley's northwestern Londoner alone.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra as of autumn 2016.
The magazines, down to the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start in her new mission with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, including carrying a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm," he says.

The administrations of SAK, Akava and STTK of employees will deal with the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Labour market organisations have, among other things, a dispute over the commitment of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organizations have promised a career solution by autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be born this week.
Pihtipudas.
Rovaniemi-based women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped over the league Western Athletes in Pihtiputa in the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula twisted five wins of one stretched match 3-2.
The last round WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead all the time.
The battle was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's spruce was in that 40-cent American centr Jennifer Keddy was stuck on the sidelines.
Sara Niemi played the center.
Despite his thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed WoVo's most fiery combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a hacker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 round.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian armor and a libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparation for the league will continue next week's turn when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to the training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday with a "trader" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet at the sports college for the second time.

Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to a delayed diagnosis and access to abrasive treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Senior Research Fellow Susan Jordan QIMR of Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases, and socio-economic status also affected the chance of survival.
In older women and cancer, when cancer was more widespread, the likelihood of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and distant areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities have a lower probability of coping with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and complicated treatment as possible reasons.
"The specialists in gynecology are best treated by specialists in gynecology, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
While treatments as remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old housewife living in Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen sled parking activities in the Friendship Park, located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the town plan proposal for Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be made to a service point in Osvita for public viewing.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of the town plan change, the city wants to enable tourism-related snowmobile activities to continue in the area.
A park area is to be formed, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and it and the river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
Refueling points may also be placed in the area in a specified part.
Maintenance is also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement will be valid for spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and formula change have sparked even loud opposition.
Residents of neighboring apartment buildings have been hungry for both vote and concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied and no observations exceeding the guide values have been identified in the studies.
The renewed equipment is also lower than old.
The friendship park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further, the hotel's safari pigs should be transported to safaris on buses that would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the Friendship Park area and the surrounding area is also wide enough, better than the places shown as substitute departure points, such as the next boat pier next to the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because operations can expand in the future, for example, the Ounaspavilion area.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the urban strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, which states that the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient quality areas for logistics and functionally affordable places.
The Friendship Park is also marked as the starting place for snowmobileing in the centre's sub-general plan, which has not yet gained legal power.
The landing of owner-occupied housing is reflected in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach a "main target group" in terms of their age.
According to a Financial Times report, home rentals only spend 55 percent of the amount of money used by homeowners for gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as parking space. These factors also threaten the garden sector, which is estimated at around £5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, and there is the least money per household per household in the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), the increase in housing rental or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS's leading garden advisor, says that "for example, plants grown in mobile breeding containers are particularly popular among home rentals, as such growing vessels can be included in changes if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming period of resale in the horticulture sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather conditions, after last year's weather in March and April.
Turkey to question US diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide a report on espionage by Americans and British in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Embassy Attorney and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
Der Spiegel magazine and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal that Turkey was the main spy site for intelligence services in the United States and the UK.
Turkish news agencies say Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all large states have spyed on each other.
A previous report on espionage by the German main intelligence service to Ankara gave a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actress performing in several success films, has been attached to the female head in the new Finnish film.

Mallorca's Magaluf Police Chief on Charges of Corruption
The incident reported evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The chief of police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca has been arrested for a damp celebration as a result of corruption charges made by well-known traffic and barowners in the Magaluf region.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in pre-trial detention after several owners of Punta Ballena Street presented corruption charges against him, and on Punta Ballena Street is located most of Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, who reported the case, presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Attorney's Office against Corruption on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are questioned by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a whole-country daily, wrote about the bias of nightclub owners' angry authorities, which made their business significantly more difficult.
"It's no longer money, but survival," one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines this summer when a YouTube video spread online, with an 18-year-old British holidaymaker having oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of infamous, alcohol-fist pub crawlers.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawler organizer Carnage were jointly fined.
Above all, the popular Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular with a so-called balconing trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol consumption, when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending summer in bomb shelters when rockets and grenade launchers bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli and Hamas War and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the southern Israeli communities bombed by rockets, but the tracks of the battles are still visible.
In the city of Ashdod, in the city of Ashdod, workers removed fragments from walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbuts named Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks returning to school in a long time feels "a little weird."
"We've had some difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited kibbuts near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire began, thousands of residents of the Saad-like border area communities had stayed indoors or left their homes to safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are suspicious of the return after the Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
The Ministry of Education said more than ten families had not yet returned.
Children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the education and safety of children would be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire in force for the time being last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and the reopening of the air and sea roads in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
Palestinian and UN estimates that more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of deaths, saying that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to more than 100 UN-run schools, which had been turned into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still protected and the fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the previous week.
"I hope that the school will soon open and we will be back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old living in a school in the city of Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, house prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measures the prices of the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, was shown by RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices increased for summer, July and August were 4.2 per cent, more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9%, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of price increases.
RP Data results show that house prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the previous year.
Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin's housing markets are next busiest; the average price rise is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, spring that started in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of homes to be auctioned, generally a lively pace of sales and still constant low interest rates, it is likely that housing prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have led record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
More than 70,000 guests have visited Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic pop art works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among other things.
Mänttä's Fine Arts Week said on Monday it set a visitor record after 14,500 interested parties had visited the Waiting event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been swept from doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the full-year number of visitors will be coming to the Serlachius Museums this year to draw closer 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is hoped that the art season will continue far over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in Kajaani.
On Sunday night, the commercial property was broken into the commercial property by breaking the window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck tank.
Between Sunday and Monday, a boat had been taken from the marina with its stern engines.
The rowboat was light from the outside and yellowish from the inside.
The inside read the text "OIVA" on the beak side.
A couple of suspects, the police already caught.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was hacked in Tikkapurontie.
The police dog got a mark and a 30-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding in the woods under the tree.
On Monday, police captured another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Lost amphetamines brought murder charges in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to the kajaaniism, born in 1977.
The prosecution said the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot a car with a shotgun a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kayan woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed the other man with him to be a shooter.
The incident came to police attention when a police patrol stopped a passenger car with a party burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burned clothing strips, a cut-out shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will give a sentence on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature throughout the summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says, "My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a seven immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, Britain's Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19, and the relationship between the boy and father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on fictional conversation with his father and developed based on the Radio 4 channel series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat stars.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he ponders a lot about his relationship with his father.
It was very hard to read Dad.
His face was never seen, only the voice said: Stop noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move on!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brother Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed the form of a beer tutor or the beauty of cricket hockey, for example.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was that smiley man in the corner for me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, thus gaining an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
Melting plants are a little brighter today but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth depths, where flames, smoke and soot are plunged, and that bring to mind the grave.
Dad used to take a bath and only lie in the tub, and slowly began singing on himself as he washed the dirt of the smelting plant out of himself.
As I walked around the meltyard, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity offered by the parents.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started getting sick shortly before she died we started repeating to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love he lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you all the time"?
Stop the hugging already!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
That was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
When I started suffering from plenty of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a tough diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult —
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard, perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
Next was the Greens comedy and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidas").
Making theatre offers a different experience than sitcomit and comedy that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started a factory employee when he was only 16 years old in the business.
A DJ noticed him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces capability competition.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-70s. "For a long time I was the only black imperator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn to produce jokes from the conveyor belt from 1975 to 1985, while living stardom and I was on TV.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and disapproval, I was able to work at huge events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, multi-year favorite and lightweight entertainment program" was at the same time "a groaning parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 80s, where both made fun and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade with ads, documents, TV shows, and movie parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series shown on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len — now it looks like you're just pedaling in your place or on sidings."
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught us in school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class that wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare topic sparked fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, "Try.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Dating words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry uttered 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost as if I had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, so take it seriously, learn your sack, do a little background study.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was a success in the end.
It was apparently expected to fail, but it didn't quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead role in the Greens comedy.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre and I couldn't really believe it was true.
At one point, the idea came to mind, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me sighed by relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You are part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry says, of course, in a loud voice.
I mean, I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little humor chicks constantly interrupt our conversations as he changes from one impression to another.
To refrain from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting immediate thanks to an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you constantly thirst for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general, it no longer inspires me the same way as I used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's going to go on a new stand-up tour.
It brings me real joy to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning, mid-stage and end of the whole trip, and I don't think I'll ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting —
It's really fun.
The story is constantly being told, and I like to do that.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer receive pay, the government's statement announced.
The government suspects that thousands are still paid after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on "ghost workers" wages and other financial abuses per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reported on the capital Nairobi.
All officials must notify themselves in the register over the next few weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, the Board of Directors said in a statement.
According to the bulletin, anyone who fails to do this for no proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will rationalise the public sector significantly, because this defines how many people really work in their duties. In addition, this is how wage lists are cleaned at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of "ghost workers"," says Anne Waiguru, an official of the cabinet of the Ministry for Decentralization and Planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year in Seinäjoki may remain in deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure developments in a tight economic situation.
Based on the current draft budget, the annual margin is falling into a deficit of around 9.4 million.
The potential means of enhancing were to compromise on the scope and level of services, as well as purchases of services, the sale and grants of assets, and increasing tax and payment income.
The €10 million reduction target for investments is 8.5 million.
There is no relief to the situation of municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient increase in tax revenue, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in central government shares will further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the Economic Seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous in the need to make savings.
The ship must be translated into the strategy goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals made to be prepared by the management team.
The City Board's proposals are the basis for budget preparation at the council's financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through board processing to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of "juno" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking police officials among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were linked to corruption studies last December targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large criminal single and following phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that time) said the police were part of Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen's planned action against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenal Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukkhov, who is the leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter visits, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children can learn that will be useful to them in the future.
The celebrations of the first day of school include traditionally embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas Perry says the blasphemous tweet was unauthorized
A blasphemous image of the Democratic District Attorney was sent from a confirmed Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night in the middle of this hearing allegations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't accept tweet and I've removed it," a later publication said.
Perry's background forces did not immediately respond to clarification requests.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet contained a libeling cartoon of Travis District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry prevented Lehmberg's office from funding when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month while Perry was on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times with larger promills... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's agency did not lead a major jury investigation against Perry.
The study was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the allegations and said that the law on the basis of which the governor, which is most in Texas, is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-wing monitoring team to make a formal complaint about the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly — and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself on Twitter, jogging on the lake with the text "Here comes, South-Car!".
Berkeley says the housing market is "normal" again
One of London's most important developers has warned that the South-East England housing market has "returned" to normal activity levels.
The capital of London apartments has been plagued by huge demand and a sharp price increase while fearing a widespread credit bubble, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Piggley, founder and president of a high-level developer, Berkeley, said Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and number of trades have returned to normal since the 2013 peak" and added that this has enabled a "stable operating environment".
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors sought hordes to the capital.
According to land register data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
Berkeley's average sales prices for private, affordable and student buildings rose by about one-fifth in the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric of a possible "map tax" before the May general elections.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that an April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending regulations, would lead to a lower level of market growth in both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Hamptons International, a real estate agent, has fallen to its 2015 forecast for London real estate prices, which says prices are falling by 3%, as the index measuring the opinion of homeowners' prices has already begun to decline.
The number of trades made in London's most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have dropped one quarter ago, real estate agent WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Piggley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained lively."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax gains rose by 40% to a year ago, thus reaching £380 million and net sales increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Piggley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings of the year meet the market's current expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange at a price of £23.96 this afternoon.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold 100 other stars were leaked by Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
A member of the Hunger Games Star confirmed that the images are genuine and condemned the hacker for "solent violation of privacy".
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will receive the allegations.
The images originally released on the 4chan image release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. Hundreds of other hacking stars on the list are claimed to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those who watch pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you have a good feeling," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are FOLLOWED, don't you understand."
Let me put an end to this right start.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande banned the authenticity of the images of the star.
Only we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter j
They dissolved, it described the best thing that happened, gradually they came apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from a woman that he was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps a little prickly.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had been a relationship in the early stages, which had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some content to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, a village of the north that was even harsher and further from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion that Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house located in a humid but paradise-like valley, and the valley name was appropriately the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds grew in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Candidates will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on a broken terrace chair in the middle of long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both, listening scatteredly to the receiver through which the whole country heard calming music and soothing news when Ailin's cross, sun-bred feet brought Kevern a song that had long since been sung by a black performer who had long since been forgotten and was often listened to by his father.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were too aggressive in principle and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not forbidden — nothing was really forbidden — they were just no longer called.
They wanted to be left in oblivion, as did the word forget.
Public opinion brought about what the laws and the proclamation had not been achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs, cookbooks and romances of heroes, in terms of music, they favored ballads.
By the day, Kevern began to keyen the imaginary piano and sing a serenade to Ailinn's big feet in a cheeky comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the letter "j" could escape his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father said he played the same game as his own father.
If you let a word start with j, and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't it now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of that.
Jazz had not been declared banned either, it was not just played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word if.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that he did not remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
No laws or coercion were needed here either.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude — grateful, that they were as spared by the trade of happiness — the principle that each group did things inherent in it.
Based on their Temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribian ancestry are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical equipment, so it was for their job to ensure that every family had a working phone used to handle things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When IT, WHAT THE EVENT, IF THE EVENT came true, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not escaped in fear of being accused of splashing the flames and fearing that those flames would reach them next, opened restaurants serving labneh yoghurt and burned the water pipe, and continued to their lives as created.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and he found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern just sang had ever been dressed as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-legged people think.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of leaves of giant cabbage main plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was amusing to Dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of view.
Nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow-black hair cover.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said but didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed to be genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for it.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to be fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair while pouring the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made of plain flowers only, so he could not use it as a cause for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me in you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear that was visible in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he would hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, chilly sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even after EVENT, even more pale and diabolical than their smuggler and dispersal grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He would see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
First, bulge — kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter of a man and a woman; the antidote to the insignificant love ballads pumping out the receiver — the suction first and then attack.
Kevern thought that was too much, for already suction itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed his going — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go out the upstairs window — a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt a sense of pity for Kevern and men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who turned his back, bowed, shameful, beaten man who had lost all the fighting will — why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen such a thing once before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and avid 32-year-old researcher, who worked in a private institution measuring General Opinion of Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in the areas of the country where a reduction in violence, or even an end, was most likely given the money and energy spent to eradicate it.
"A lot has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "so that the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite church towers over hedges, human gentleness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people cry with sentimental ballads, devouring stories about overcome adversity, and swears by virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty holds both rural communities and urban common-law areas in its relentless grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more unpreferred desire for quarrel in homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked to the ground.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to appeal not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
This workplace does not maintain prejudices.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such things you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil soul, others usually call natural energy and physical intensity.
Hose IT WHAT EVENTED IF EVENTED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flamingon-red LED light declared instruction that Ofnow had already shared on the ground for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice when he was sure that his director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think ourselves are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to YOU, WHAT EVENTED IF EVENTED.
This time, though, we will not shed our anger and distrust of others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "described 'errors' the actions our grandparents may have done or not to do.
You also go too far when you say they poured out their 'hate and distrust of others'."
One like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'they'.
There was no 'us' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme dared to continue, "no group of society can say they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it be good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it any more - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what the past exists for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and expressed that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as normal, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving passersby described as "bad-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army bans planning attack; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho Army officials have denied staged the attack on the overthrow of the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had besieged his official apartment and taken over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state and his family traveled to a neighboring South Africa after telling him that he has received a threat of death.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi banned the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics". The police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Forces took action after receiving several intelligences that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems," he told Voice of America.
Clayson Monyela, Speaker of the South African government, said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary company.
"Although no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to match the hallmarks of the revolutionary attempt in all respects," he says.
Lesotho's army officials say the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is under action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements from the Grand Coalition government.
He forbids that he has beenlittled government power, even though otherwise claimed.
Shop magazine: Microsoft sets up a data center in Newland
Microsoft, an information technology company, has established a large data center in a New Country location, the location of which the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaan had previously been guessed as the place of the centre.
Microsoft will completely terminate its Oulu office, which takes the job from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's communications director, told STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The creation of a data center to Uusimaa was told Monday by Kauppalehti.
Man accused of riding on girl on traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is accused of driving on a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving on a girl at a intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused her injuries.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied charges at Dundee Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I took these pictures at the family party using several different cameras, each cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules worth following.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, still make sure the camera battery and other parts are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera shooting settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or camera and video camera combinations have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions underwater.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only withstand 5 legs depths, others up to 50-60 feet depths.
Discover both ordinary and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to composition the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows branching, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light is significantly reduced by deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors in your photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you will appear.
Try to get close to the target to be photographed.
This is important advice when describing on land, but even more important underwater, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning the photographer must be close to the object so that the target fills the entire image down to the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders - protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to elect candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing unrest that requires democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong business block after activists begin to plan and implement demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Congress, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general candidate when choosing a Hong Kong leader would be too "Catotic".
Since 1997, with the UK hand over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it allowed Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the appointment committee, which is managed from Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
The summer before the decision, some of the largest and most striking protests in the region were held in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign to defend democracy was largely the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing did not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in rain in front of Hong Kong's main administrative buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would bring about protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, the organizers said that the movement "keeps the Occupy Central stunt as a last resort to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance of dialogue has failed and taking over the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were strict near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, restlessness is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power from their city.
The wave of those arriving from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeblood — the business world.
"The test they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it will last," says Regina Ip, a legislator who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are henchmen of Western powers inciting revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people — more than one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the region's largest democratic demonstrations.
U.S. Prom tradition strikes British universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to respond to demand by establishing Britain's first luxury-class travel form for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the customer's most memorable arrival at the university.
Stewart also said there is a security aspect in the service.
Service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in cars loaded to the ends.
When combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today's students with the most easy and high-quality transportation to the university.
According to the company representative, reservations have not yet come because the service has only just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 tuition fees.
Today's students are very different for their expectations and wishes than they started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticized a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's higher education section, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of a student majority."
Many this month start their studies are shocked by the level of cost of living, as the financial subsidies available in the form of loans and grants have fallen behind the staggering increase in basic living costs. Only next can one start to think about where thousands would be found to be used for such simple as arrival on campus.

Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to faint on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his arms black U.S. match and overcome Ukraine's second half-time blood with his stagnating solutions.
But Salin transferred all honor to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to faint at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, I just clouded, there was nothing.
That noise and white public sea was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine pins at a fast pace, ball reefs, disc tracks, and tricks everywhere happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode that everything worked out.
They come from somewhere sometimes, now in an insanely important place, Sasu glowed.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others caught the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and life-creator, so no wonder his example put the whole team into a flight that was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous ones remembered a outrageous judge game
Heikki Montonen (right) was the head coach of Finland at the Argentine World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament than yesterday's day: it was a hot match against France in the early part.
"In the resolution balls of that match, the jury game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set the backline.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the pasta went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montose and finally finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world's champions as the Polish World Cup will get off today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The players' power values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of the players have also increased.
The game is faster than ever," thought Parkkali.
But what happens in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to continue from the first part.
Then it can be tight," said Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a winning match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope we'll pet the 17th place now.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Species legend Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö ventilated in the Tunisia match.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Merethe Mikkelsen from Norwegian and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers one more time.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog in the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure and pull it a little forward, but its legs just didn't carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said there was no help from the police, the nearby hotel, or passersby.
As the evening darkened, the situation already began to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message sent to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon a German man with an expedition with him also happened.
From the mattress, Cita was given a stretcher like a stretcher to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came for a moment after us when we had wondered what to do with the dog and carrying the dog down the slope for a moment, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of an excursion mattress.
Soin said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying difficult terrain went slowly.
However, after about an hour and a half, Cita was happily received all the way down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them one more time.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreached.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have returned.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On the night against Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: I hear Cita's feeling better!

Genetic deviation is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death due to a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motors, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toes thickness.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA) with a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he filled 18 and die before reaching the age of 30.
A 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than the others.
I was never able to skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several Achilles tendon surgery to straighten his feet. After the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panic-like.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose my entire ability to function.
I went through this to myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you're suffering from some much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was explained what CMT disease was, I thought I'd postponed," he said.
Charity CMT UK organizes CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian officials have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal train, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The smugglers were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles in Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Interior.
Police said the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and another 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, a couple of million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

Throughout the early part of the year, i.e. January-July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent.
Sales of daily goods, on the other hand, have increased by nearly one per cent.

Nastola donated a 1.4-acre beach plot to Bottas - worth about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-acre beach plot to Valtteri Bottas from Kärkjärvi beach from Vilupä.
The municipal government showed fair sports spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
Sora votes were not heard at the meeting when the plot was decided, Mayor Pauli Syurakki says.
Bottas' gift plot has seven farm buildings in total.
The municipality will unpack them this year, except one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure apartment on the property within two years.
We are impressed that he has enjoyed his native and wants to be here in the future.
Valtteri has visited primary schools each year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully, the mayor says.
The municipal manager estimates the monetary value of the beach plot at EUR 40000 to 60,000.
The beach is low and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, Nastola has kept those successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
The world champion of the spear throw Aki Parviainen and Aerobick world champion Tuuli Matinsalo received private home plots from the municipality and built huge detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola, but sold their properties and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsillon came to Nastola after work and then changed the life situation after the change of life.
Bottas is a native Nastolaist and his situation is different, the autumn lake inches and believes Bottas will remain in his hometown.
Hull washed attacker Hernandez's club with record sum
The Premier League club Hull invested a record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will exchange Hulli Italian club from Palermo for £9.5 million, or about 12 million euros.
The deal is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the Italian main series.
On the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games from exchange to the field.
Abel is a fantastic purchase and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull's head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he also acquired a Senegal national team captain from Mohamed Diamen West Ham.
Russian space test failed - Gekots sent on sex journey died
The five little geckos sent by Russia to increase into space have died, according to Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos traveled on the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive ability and use of gecks in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Only little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of geck eggs, for example.
Through the effects of the Gekko, efforts can be made to anticipate the effects of weightlessness on humans as he resided for longer periods of time, illustrated New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos says the time of death and cause or causes of death of the gecks will be investigated.
According to Interfax, passengers crossed as "sex getics" froze.
It is also surprising that fruit flies on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip, and also received offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track the man after he had attracted a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family was not related in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had been following the man's actions before.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalised young people attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that about 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France have traveled to Syria, returned or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team's wishes for a follow-up place are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening loss for the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the extension.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is the game leader Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter's fast guy, but we've been played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday's defeat for the United States.
We need to rediscover our own strengths.
I can guarantee that a normal wolf pack will be seen on the field," Möttölä said.
The alleged nude images of Hollywood stars spread online - some secured to be authentic
A number of nude images are spreading on the Internet that are claimed to represent well-known public figures.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "nawing campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence representatives that would seem to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen images will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
TMZ said actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a creepy effort was seen for this.
I sympathize with anyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls images by her own name fake.
Genuine or fake nude photos are also on the move, at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "Don't work enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in the last place of the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match describe the confused current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," Viitala said after the 1-2 loss ended.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the match, especially in the first half.
Goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with bad defense gambling.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, and that is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With the player roulette, many young players have also gained opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"Some don't work enough to get out of here someday," Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and think you're a betting league player and don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given many young people playing time.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the chance, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when the players change constantly.
This season has not had the same lineup twice in a row.
Especially in the defensive head, the crowd has changed.
That's the main reason we're in this place," Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS loss, with the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the betting league, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to Number One.
I've never dropped the team, and I'm not going to drop now.
We're not really going to fall out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to the TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, was reported by Louise Vesth today on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to the production company Zentropa, the series' filming should begin in 2016.
Trier is reportedly focused on the scriptwork of the series from this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also reported by Trier's long-term partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his hard sales speeches.
He said the similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Keep your breath," Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
He directed the Kingdom series for television in the 1990s.

Ice Bucket challenge participant dislocated
British Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment since she roared with the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so hard when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just roared, but when I screamed, I felt my chin started to stiffen," he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my chin was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British who took part in the superpopular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the chin was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Perspective on wolf howling (kin): How can the increase in fan volume be explained?
Today was a great feeling.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 when Finland had played an EM final tournament against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
Pehkonen didn't overdo it.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted the noise of 20,000 spectators, otherwise in an empty hall.
What would Pehkonen say 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match?
In Bilbao, there are eighty times the troops of 100 Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships were the time of search for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, in the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä with lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
In the Athens Games, a total of just over 100 Finns were present.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number there is an incomprehensible amount.
Here is explaining to sports sociologists.
In the global global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we go internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and sons succeed around the world," says Hannu Itkonen, a professor of sports sociology.
There are certainly Finns in both Spain and the World Cup in volleyball in Poland who are looking for an experience.
Common experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
There must be attraction in sports itself.
Itkonen raises sport as part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than Berlin to watch art.
Without success, you can't move the masses.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were raised to the pedestal.
Volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to productize their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such carnevalist support is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball sports also transfer this massive interest to native series?
On average, hundreds or just over 1,000 spectators are played in basketball and volleyball.
Itkonen thinks the question is good and may not give an answer that would promise very good for species.
The second school believes that interest will move.
The other is the one who doesn't want sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not two times interested.
It is a challenge for the following people in the midst of a drug.
Verification to Bottas property - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola awards the formula driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach home plot.
The municipal government approved a land of 1.4 hectares at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
A leisure apartment will rise to the plot in the future.
Nastola has been following Bottas' success since his karting times.
He is perceived as a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition condition in the area, of which the municipality will land six at the expense by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth prize baller in the Formula 1 Belgian race this year.
He's fifth at the World Cup points.
Bottas is a native Nastolaist and lived in Vilupä its childhood.
He now lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free from formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently introducing and testing them in the ongoing U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirt testers are the ball people on the field, but Marcus Giron, a top-of-the-art amateur of university players, also likes that.
He said the shirt helps him follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which information is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and from there to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The mokkula, which is a central unit, is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given the exact time to the start of selling the shirt and also did not even hint at its price," the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only attempt to invest in smart clothes.
Athos from California has brought a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 per piece and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about technowear.
Smart way to save in textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who will soon start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students in later annual courses borrow their books for nominal compensation rather than selling the books forward right away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, as well as a heavy sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College, Georgia.
Schroeder says that his books last semester would normally have paid $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university board, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less for it than students who buy a book.
According to Neebo Inc., who hold more than 250 campus bookstores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookstores in the past spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are acquired from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save clear money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would cost in the campus bookstore.
Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's ninth edition of the book "Calculus" is nearly $290, but the book from the special books online store Chegg.com is available for $239.99.
Buy when used
Books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used from Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used from Amazon.com online store for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and you don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the accent, and the fees for wear.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of a book.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of ordinary papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the access to an e-book is paid to its holder, for example Amazon.com, Chegg, or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store receives an e-book of "Calculus" for six months for about 61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and engineering can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worth it, which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine's law, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is certainly in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned through this heel.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain a book at a full price at the university bookstore.

Nearly twice as many people died in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in fires compared to last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires in the fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths at a similar time.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the worse situation was last in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
Most fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses, and seven in row and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of recaping home fire safety.
At least all home smoke detectors should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that initial fire extinguishing equipment is easily enabled.
All facilities in the home must also have an unobstructed exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for the anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called countertop meeting.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke to protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after they were stuck in the Blue Mountains in the Australian New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went out after noon on Sunday to Govets Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search patrol of local police and helpers was sent to find young people, and the two were found at about 11 a.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
Police spent the night with a couple and were raised to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk Airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
The Ukrainian army said the soldiers were given a retreat order.
Ukraine said parachute troops have fiercely clashed with Russian tanks on the field.
According to an army spokesman, the opposing gunfire has been so accurate that there are probably Russian professional soldiers as the shooter.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits in the Asova Sea in southeastern Ukraine yesterday sank in the morning, the border guard says.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard was not sure where the ship was shot from.
Separatists said they had shot the ship on social media yesterday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw from positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
The Foreign Minister said the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to any new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains spanked southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under them.
Authorities estimate on Sunday that it may take to ease the flood, although rains were predicted to cease Monday.
Hard rains were surprised by Swedish authorities, and rains were not given for weather warning in advance.
Ari Mustala, who was on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls called on the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" towards the socialist president with difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not gain approval of the French majority.
The president deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by him," Valls said and deserved applause.
As a boring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace with France's controversial 35-hour work week despite the debate given earlier this week by the new Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to work together with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing to a meeting of socialist MPs who expressed differing opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right national front, mocked the constant disunity between the socialists and said that he would not believe that the new government of Valls will last a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone calling war, but so did Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not even last for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to disband the parliament and considered his party's election victory in the early elections and he himself would be willing to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the list tip in the May EU elections.
According to a poll from the Journal du Dimanche on Sundays, 76% of Frenchmen believe that the Socialist Party may break up to several competing groups before Hollande's end in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the audience must quickly notice that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Good morning, Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka badly betrayed the programme in the recorded section.
Good morning, the Finland program released a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record the Finnish advertising puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go quite straight.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in his words as she tries to pronounce the word budget dispute, and his confusion also causes Puda and Rahkola to lose his booster time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull live broadcast tomorrow, Good morning, the Finnish Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has both been liked and shared on Facebook over 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the magazine photo office, finished third in the Potret series in 1972.
The picture is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
In Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, a meeting of the Socialist International was held in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we got over five minutes to shoot.
I took this picture four to five meters away.
The light and background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir's look shows that Middle East leaders have had a difficult time before.
Then the competition was done with images taken from well-known people or events.
It is great that you can also succeed with other images today, as long as there is an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash picture of the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than five million euros and claimed 30-50 person-years.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his doctoral thesis on information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the supervision of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings in general.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence material that fills the chain of evidence while allowing for comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: 1999's perception of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "The fish and chicken dishes included in the Kasvisdiet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's trip school caused food noise on social media, Yle says on his website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list, we prepare a vegetarian option!
This is what is stated in a 15-year-old press release that has been forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has led people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, head of the food and cleanliness service, says to Yle that the forgotten note on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care in time.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian food option only with parental permission and a doctor or nurse's certificate of a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that vegetarian experiments among young people may leave nutrition short and the absence of meat or chicken may arouse wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to acquire its competitors Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The data comes from people closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, which has a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises luxury cruises and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
Sources say that information on a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private venture capital company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations are not in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to comments and Apollo spokesman refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, which operates from Miami, has 13 cruise ships, with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales were $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails with Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises will register its first shares in the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 trade worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting accounted for 28 per cent of the company, Apollo's 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP accounted for 8% from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises accounts for 82% of North American cruise capacity, is shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise at the time of the issue of shares.
The Tampere City Board is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes the city government to support the initiative for solid support.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, the University of Tampere, who is preparing a dissertation for the University of Tampere, there is a need to end during the dolphins in Finland and around the world quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, the view has become more common that the grip of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also be seen in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a animal law issue, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi-delfiin confirms demands for the shutdown of dolphinarium activities.
Näsi's death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put a point for the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how to move Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara requires.
Näsi did not have time to experience the return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi could experience even more life than a non-inspired concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to ban the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Welfare Act in preparation.
This group also includes dolphinariums.
To support the requirement, Animalia Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins today on 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season that will be launched in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are imprisoned or killed cruelly each year, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and to immediately begin negotiations on the "stateism" of the deviant region, Russian news sources say.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine must be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's call for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to practically grant the newly declared Novorossija independence, which will allow it to be directed to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to take back the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula itself on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as a "Novorosija", "New Russia" - this term resembles the days of splendor before the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that the planned peace talks are "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians are carrying out campaigns for the parliamentary elections on October 26, and government forces will attack civilians in separatists-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of southeastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" is associated with wider independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the independence they need to the eastern regions, Peskov says.
No discussions can be held on this issue between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The interim note of the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct Putin's comments "wrong interpretation", stressed that the Russian regime deals with the separatists' rebellion in the eastern regions differently than in Crimea, when, in practice, it took over an area whose majority of 2 million people are ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to connect even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflic opinion polls, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in an area that unites Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historical coastal sites.
The area between Rostov of Russia and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators — after the new elections — consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions different from Ukraine's nuclear territory from their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest claim to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels progressed more last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the Azov Sea coast.
Ukrainian security authorities fear that the taking over the city of Novoazovsky, supported by Russia, will be the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategically significant coastal area to Crimea.
It has led to massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol, a population of half a million inhabitants, known as the steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Saturday, seeking further action to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the Ukrainian region.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; leaders proposed to draw up further sanctions so that they can be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored departments and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk last week to strengthen separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
Lysenko said the first 63 soldiers in Ukraine surrounded by Russia in Ilvaisk were exchanged for 10 Russian skydivers who were imprisoned in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez from the penalty kick.
Laziokin got a tough one at the end of the game at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez turned down Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In the coaching debut of Milan's former striker icon Inzagh, San Siro Stadium was only half-round.
The total number of the match was announced as 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he may have stolen nude photos by hackers and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a group of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were released on the internet as a result of a wide celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanta, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky, and Grecko, who lives in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in connection with iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and distributed.
Greckon, in New York, is reported to have commented on the case in the online newspaper "shake" and said that the victims "feel themselves are disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on the topless pool edge.
Palmer's film earnings include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that "it's a cheeky violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen became angry with the hacker in his tweet: "The publication of images stolen from a run is no different from selling a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost like its home field and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba at the World Volleyball World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan drug.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue-white.
According to the STT, Finland's victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek Arena.
It felt like playing at home.
Such a big impact on our game, Captain Antti Siltala of Finland told the STT.
Finland was already down 0-2 in the match, but rose to win 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle rise from six points.
Cuba already led a batch of 16-10, but then the Finns got the ecstasy on.
However, a couple hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an field, the charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to a hard fog.
So fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish ball sports fans have conquered Europe at a high pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are over 8,000 Finland fans present.
It was as if every basket in Finland was the winning basket of the match, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
