28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
Only recently, a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping mall staircase this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his business in order."
The body found at the Westfield Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galician, according to the San Francisco forensic agency.
San Francisco Police Department says the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he released San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant as chef six months ago.
A representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and close team like a family, and we're sorry is great," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his business in order.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went with the river.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
All those who know something about the case are asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip number 415-575-4444.
Stopping junior doctors demand new industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors in Britain (which are mainly the responsible doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked permission for new industrial action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), part of the British Doctoral Union (BMA), is asking its entire government to support further industrial action from early September.
JDC said ministers have not resolved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in July.
58% of the members who participated in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter sent to JDC members on Thursday night, saying the government "sustained" about questions that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has in its vote rejected a whole new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government asking for permission for gradual expanding industrial action since early September."
Due to the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, which included the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health care system.
BMA junior doctors director Johann Malawana resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract that BMA had recommended.
Malawana told BMA members at pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted. 54,000 junior doctors and medical students participated in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would come into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake up and complete the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish official in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The two sides did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't see much heat even with his own reserved standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin â€” five times, according to a report.
I didn't stay on the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the head of Russia has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the event was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara in strict words and accused the back of stabbing.
The insult was all the bigger because it came from a supposed friend.
Getting real trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has emphatically denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only held so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
This allowed Russia to win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost deposed last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey in a firm manner, especially a charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh with relief when air traffic can finally be continued.
They put their faith in a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will decrease when imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article by the financial magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it believes that the West reacted quietly to the attempted coup.
Not to mention the old grudge from the advancing Turkish EU membership negotiations and Putin's intervention. Putin, who is eager to take advantage of cool relations and erode Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, who has its own ingrainated concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey at their top meeting could convey a picture that was described by an analyst as an "exsociation of outsiders" at their summit: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
Syria is the most significant, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacebuilder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says much that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both president told a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question of differences in the countries, while Putin, in turn, stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they could seek an agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full disaster caused by the NATO member state Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat plane, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services in the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank's global goals.
The bank had to back off its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rubby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to release more national brands in the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used as an acronym for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWests, except for headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is becoming an investment brand and because our staff is employed because we are now becoming a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nationsrugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to move into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's CEO.
"It would have been very sneering three years ago if we had said that we will be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and focus on the needs of our customers, rather than our own needs, have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode the Prediction to win in Newmarket and won his 3,000th win
The dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant him a 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000 wins in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Prediction twice to win that night on the track of his own locality. Prediction is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in races running on a flat track.
He has previously been the same by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition event is not large, not Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and feel great humility."
Dettori accepts cheers with Prediction after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle race, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical ethnity is what separates him from others.
He is a fantastic representative for race riding, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 races if he didn't compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been winning for nearly 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person who is good for British race riding, but above all, he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori ventilated his achievement in a distinctive way by jumping down her horse's back.
"From the flying finish to fly-to-flying entry, Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing riding for two decades.
There have been ups and downs.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived the air accident and has been banned due to drug abuse.
When the ban on competition three years ago ended, he had initial start-start difficulties, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And he's not going to end his career for a while yet â€” Dettori has recently said he wants to pursue a race career until he's at least 50."
Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, head of government
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's entrusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov as head of the Russian presidential administration," but no justification for the dismissal was reported.
Anton Vaino, who served as Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol department and government office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
Persecute thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you have given are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Perino as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of government, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state television both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially under parliamentary elections.
Are the fired result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man praised as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to give responsibility for this very complex and somewhat even difficult job for four years.
I have now been the Chief of Administration of the President for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the state security service KGB.
When Putin served as head of the KGB- replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed deputy chief.
As Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russian President after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from choosing for a third term.
However, the mission went to another person close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent fight at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the series, reported kicks in a joint statement.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he said in a statement.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the series following FBI agents will be released later, reports in a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Gibson, who previously played in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been involved in the series since its first season, or since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released on Friday.
"I hoped I could see the series to the end, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production group and the most important: the best fans the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
Mysterious landing of fish in the Banffic Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been sucked on the ground by a cyclone.
Bain, which lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage on Periscope from the vision and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-centimetre fish.
Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife
The Â£1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land bridge of Queensferry's overpass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "cover wires" that are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 diagonal wires.
The Â£1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the Minister of Cabinet for the Economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a really significant step forward in building the bridge, and more than 30,000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge section alone.
Despite massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means that the lid is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road cover of the North Tower column, we then had to close the remaining northern (i.e., the ground) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern land bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time high precision operation.
Massive because the ground bridge is 222 metres in length and about 6,000 tons in weight and had to be pulled up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small â€” just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports three men's miracle rescue
Three men who were on water from his fishing boat off Anglesey were saved like a miracle.
Moelfre RNLI's sea rescue station set an alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew detected the accident in Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued their reckless passage without a pilot.
"We saw the boat orbit right next to them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we got out, fortunately, strong winds had carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted cling to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who were caught up in water are still alive and perfectly fine.
There was an emergency fire on the boat's engine, but for some reason it had been detached from a man driving the boat during the fall.
They really had their luck on their journey."
PokÃ©mon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to follow how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside and stare at their screens.
PokÃ©mon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, the screen time was only taken by watching the TV, then video games and most recently came the smartphones.
So it is great to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to PokÃ©mon Go. PokÃ©mon Go is a game app whose characters date from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a series of drawings, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped shortly before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Launching in other countries was delayed due to tremendous interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of PokÃ©mon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for pokÃ©mons on their smartphones, which are tracked with GPS. When found, it can be "photon" (with a phone screenshot) or "capped".
The wild has pulled out a generation that played a video game younger and raised the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported, the Apple Watch's Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game's launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users play PokÃ©mon Go, it sees only the raw data of the amounts of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large amount of other benefits.
The fineness of PokÃ©mon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-supporting things â€” exercise, fresh air, and sun and joy.
During the yacht, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also disapproves of joy.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
Breakthrough is done.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could already monitor your activity before, they did not give a reason to get moving, as PokÃ©mon Go does.
The novelty disappears, and use will decrease in due course.
However, thanks to the success of PokÃ©mon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in a real world, which increases the exercise of people leaving the yacht and improving their condition and health.

Simone Biles catches gold in women's rack gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless with boom.
The jaws fall with a permanno.
Great in everything.
And now, at last, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old rack gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall point on 6 February 1998 was clearly better than the silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alyya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform in the boom at the multi-match final of the women's rack gymnastics individual competition on Thursday at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman ever to win the multi-match championship, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best ever.
Biles burst into tears when his total final point became visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and brings him to the same class as other superstars of sports, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to her kind for the past three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and accurate programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest rack gymnast of all time."
There was one last race left in Brazil, primarily between Biles and himself and the burden of oversized expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals, would be disappointed.

Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i, who coordinated the national team and now retired to Martha Karoly's going-away.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program â€” which includes a volt series known as his trump card â€” is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A power figure has become a power figure from adopting her grandparents as a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother. Boorman found the girl when she was on a daycare tour in the gymnastics hall where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak will probably continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead with two threads, it was like mirage.
The boom and permanto were left, where Biles is a defensive world champion.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points from the shop and crowned the outcome with the 15.933 points from the permano.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points â€”which was a mere formality â€” and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white, and blue glittering crop color when the dream he once wrote in his clipbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small repulsion for a race four years ago when he first divided third place but then lost bronze to Mustafina in a re-round.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader who Americans call the team's "others" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanto program, thus becoming a winner from the defeat station, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old earlier and widespread tweet now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three music listened to in the car were the victim of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, sitting in the car and listening to music when they were shot, a police statement released on Thursday.
Authorities said on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah, were shot in a car parked on the street side.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then escaped in another car," the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple killing was probably not caused by the robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four attacks previously committed.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Latin Americans within four months.
"It is common to events that they have occurred in residential areas off homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of television and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW and white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
Scientists do not want to reveal what made them conclude that the attacks are interrelated and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police issued a statement reporting of the shooting of an empty convertible just half an hour before the triple killing, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found shell casings and recovered fragments of a bullet and a bullet in the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things become better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has a microcephaly, or congenital smallness due to the genetic disorder of her mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of while pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn't get through this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not committed to this.
What is not true at all - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and his husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any more practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a rollator.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents the signland invented by Edmund, with which she means "sing for me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language, but also includes fives invented by Edmund himself.
There may be several different diseases behind microcephaly: hereditary, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or zikavirus.
There is great variation in symptoms and predictions.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those with zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept doing it: what happens to us,
What will happen to us."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zikavirus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to be arranged.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The Louisiana governor declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rain in the state is expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Misissipi flooded over their crusts and spread to a wide area as a result of strong heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Agency, said the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone has asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
Flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most Southern Louisiana.
According to a statement provided by the weather service, another 76 to 127 mm of water may enter the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record heights.
According to the weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows in Liverpool, Louisiana, immediately south of the Mississippi State border, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier on Friday among those rescued near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally over 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other stepon nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water came with a constant pitch," Hansford says.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that he has never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family members have all injuries, and he himself is the only swimming skill of them.
Rescue workers had saved all three large army-style trucks and taken them to the fire station Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation regulations.
He tells of the information from an observer near Livingston that nearly 350 mm had rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil got strongly wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to the flooding of heavy rains and streets, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipa City Council had told the WWFL, a subsidiary of television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
County leader Robby Miller said the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped by the flood.
Places of refuge have been opened for the evacuated in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to withdraw," he says.
Nearly twenty streets had to be closed in the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa County due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
"We experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city government.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat off the Gulf of Mexico coast, says Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy says that Thursday was reported on Thursday, a handful of flood-stricken houses, but on Friday there had been none so far.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has received multiple bullets in their body, survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second 6-year-old shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy had several gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start the first class in the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men were also shot and one 32-year-old man.
The second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The television company said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The venue was full of assault gun-type shell casings that come from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old who was the victim of shooting in the city this week was a girl who was hit by a stray bullet while playing off her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's rack gymnastics, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team lineup, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female rack gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances and surprising and mastery of three world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday to win gold in a multi-match of the women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are such at the top of the species, but the same does not look the same in rack gymnastic classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next rack gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private rack gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid by training costs, facilities, trips, appearances, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most rack gymnastic clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the operations.
The teaching of teline gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached the sport since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide a more affordable and better available rack gymnastic teaching for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm Simone, Gabby and Laurie have awakened.
I founded my own rack gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for rack gymnastics for over 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin American), and some of these young people have reached national and international masters.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality rack gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, suppleness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start rack gymnastics, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girlpower" you showed in winning Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to decide on changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (British Medical Association), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, rejected the proposal.
Health Minister Hunt said in July about plans to reach an agreement and said the British public health care system (NHS) was "no one's land" and that all additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement, which includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement. A particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and not treat all doctors fairly.
It's only eight weeks since the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to deal with discussion attempts and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
Despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door is always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, refute the implementation of the contract and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this doesn't happen, junior doctors are ready for new industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to complete the dispute on the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the union staff representing British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the contract.
NHS employee CEO Daniel Mortimer appealed to junior doctors not to take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "The industrial action achieves very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at the limit and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of grievances.
The workers were hopeful that a continuing positive commitment to other important topics â€” such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector â€” were a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Health Education, and the Ministry of Health want to adhere to agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A drug that costs â‚¬2.40 can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to about â‚¬2.40 per day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
Anti-hydration drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is currently given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK's public health care system (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), which is part of the UK public health care system (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people receive a heart attack every year, one quarter of whom a heart attack recurs or they are taking a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can give rise to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is released, it can pass with the blood flow and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new scene is higher in people who have received a heart attack once.
A ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be given next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and also give aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the Center for the Introduction of Treatment Methods (NICE), says: "Although effective methods of treatment are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have received a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke â€” often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in terms of risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the use of the treatment method is not recommended in the draft procedure for a longer period of time.
Due to the climate that cherished political correctness, voting fraud flourished
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, resulting in a report.
The climate that cherished political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals the government report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticized police, election observers and city councils for closing their eyes to election fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethics and religion."
According to Pickles, a former Minister of Regional Government and the current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when he comes to voting.
At present, the voter must only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip fingers after voting in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He insists that journalists' access to Government documents and decisions of informal boards and working groups be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and a culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet voting scandal.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should dismiss his position due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court held that Rahman "falsely" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "are the basis of his campaign that it was the religious duty of every religious Muslim to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questioned or given fraudulently by the person voting by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was obtained from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about postal elections, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring ID at the polling station.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, especially in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh background."
"It was concerned that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such action because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean the system, including banning the handling of mail voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent "harvest of votes".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also requires stricter checks on the registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options to require voters to present an identity card before voting.
Baptizing fingers after voting in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Denying the processing of completed votes and mail voice envelopes sent by post from political activists.
Police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Changing the law to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the Representation of the People Act on the expansion of voting rights in 1983.
Prohibition of photography at polling sites.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person is allowed to go to the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric severely criticizes the London police and considers it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his duties for corruption and numerous illegal procedures," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective "training inspections" of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The court's decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a revival," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and disguised electoral fraud by some parties."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance with Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers wild at Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance with the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship with a well-known person.

CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4 x 200 metres free swimming message stunned CBC's direct Olympic report viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smelling" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to shoot his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 metres free swimming message final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left at a rapid pace, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam at the time of the second section of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim in China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did CBC's commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
In the women's 4 x 200-metre free swimming message final, a new Chinese Ai Yanhan, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egged, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with fierce Byron MacDonald's critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
Tweeters did not hold their words back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist group. #responsible."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
Commentator colleague Scott Russel had to offer apologies on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his apologies to a comment by over 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, these statements and that they were able to broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers at last night, and we also made an apology to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies on the broadcast and tried to defend his speeches by saying he didn't mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment I gave last night after women's communications," MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I made a swimmer to perform, not a person.
Needless to say, I didn't mean anything degrading with my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, unblocked underwear in the middle of the store, the woman who matched customers
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit the underwear.
He further worsened the situation by assessing what he looked like in the underwear, took them off the leg, and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at Folkestonen Bouverie Place shopping centre, where she tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store at the same time, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells us what happened, "People couldn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear, and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it completely shamelessly.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he tried off the leg and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times again before he finally decided he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes â€”and he didn't think about someone who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues, "How gross to think that someone is taking home the underwear that someone else has worn and have not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that the store staff sought to remove those clothing items from the sale after the woman had left â€” what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without them being washed after that," adds Davidson.
A spokesman for Primark commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation that occurred in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All products in question have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, Grand Master of Krav Maga, New York City, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser swinging the gun at close distance.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or behind.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the shooting line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it gets between your elbow and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with the knee to the groin, and when he goes double from pain, slap him on the face with a gun barrel and retreat by holding the gun directed at him.
The technique is similar if an armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move off the shooting line, grab a gun, and twist it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist into the chest. Turn the gun out of the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber by handing over your cash â€” unless you are Krav Maga Grand Master.
Travel guide world traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and kakomis reflex to a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-based host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking euro banknotes, hand railing Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on the luminometer to see himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made in a documentary film Ian Wright - On the trail of inner power, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the toilet flush button on a train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals from strengthening good gut bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad-tasting mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
licking the handrails and toilet flush button at the railway stations undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in a documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid and put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms, and curing water."
In the film, he really showed that he was worthy of his reputation.
The border only came in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The Luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
By comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came in a Russian general toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4000 units â€” in newly washed hands, the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright - On the trail of internal power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in various places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've smelled in any bathroom.
4,000 units, nothing's dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright - Following inner power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps strengthen the good strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the category manager of Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time is about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we ended up in the idea of asking Ian."
Salt health has become a global trend.
" Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is related to resistance.
Salt health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty lickings shot on tape."
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria, especially to abdominal and intestinal well-being and 58 percent reported using products that have been added to lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Before his eviction family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall
The disruptor family left behind Â£50,000 in the renthouse owned by the city after they had evicted because of the terroristization of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Cornwall's Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company stated that the apartment was in renovation condition when shocked.
There were gaping openings in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been applied to floors, and the walls were stuffed with graffiti.
The couple has now moved and are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, chief of the Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Housing), says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for people living here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to weigh on this, as the property is likely to become known not as such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and police say that the family's tyranny included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and caring, and loud shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47-year-old who signed the lease, received an antisocial behavior order in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the house under the demolition threat.
Drugs had previously been sold out of the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors say the family fought on the street and police had to call the scene regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency erupted the couple by coercively this week after giving them 11 weeks more time to move away voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction â€”they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, the head of forced fillings at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which police were regularly invited.
Garbs and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is an accident that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as the eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and offered to give us information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of neighbors and send a message that antisocial behavior will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in twenty.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now need to clean away the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, as well as Â£1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of holding a Class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013, for the tombstone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall Police says this evict serves as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flyed, army jet that hibered the beach frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers were shocked by their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft crashed smoothly.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicked when a low-flyed jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes near contact distance from tourists sunbathing on the sandy beach in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got up on their feet, comprehensiblely, about the thunder of the jet engines, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who shot a dramatic pass and videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice at a really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was rushing down."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro experienced shock when the plane suddenly became visible and flew staggeringly low.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the aircraft had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke caused by nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of continental Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to poor visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight, in which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Exote's first half of the year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result than planned in January - June.
Exote's result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, exote is trying to shorten the sequences of measures.
Exote covers a deficit previously generated by surplus.
The proportion left over it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The government will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borders Faulted in Immola Military Power
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School swore a military oath on Friday.
The military jury of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Borders Course Valuation was held on the garrison sports field.
The military oath was sworn by 70 conscripts.
Special border hockey is trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for special border ice cream.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special limiters have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting held in connection with the oath involved five veterans of the wartime border forces.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A drawing of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is invisible on the outside.
At the HÃ¤me Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and HÃ¤meenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant placed in Lahti.
The officers are Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in HÃ¤meenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costumes.
The unit has shown its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero SeppÃ¤nen.
The RTA unit produces various investigations to the rest of the police.
In HÃ¤me, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crimes, i.e. the police would not leave the whistles until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units were established in the country and its own criminal intelligence unit in each police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police, leads operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas shared by police institutions, and their mission is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own area
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit aims to use registers, alarm mission database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of doing, the author makes up a certain image.
Preparations can be done either on the basis of the method of action or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit employees do not go through the city with collars, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both our own and criminals are not reported, because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thus seeking to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police will publicly tell you about the methods if it anticipates them to pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, the method of marking empty dwellings used in housing breaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, knob needle, or tape piece on the front door of the apartment, with which they tried whether the residents were really out of town.
Pre-trial investigation material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest order the District Court minutes, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves in their hands.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero SeppÃ¤ from HÃ¤me Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police Police, Detective Inspector Sami JoutjÃ¤rvi from Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in the number of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new course of action were taken as early as 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended until the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl joining ISIS killed in Syria
News reports that one of three British schoolchildren joining ISIS last year, Cadiza Sultana, have been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a ISIS base in Syria, said ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, just planning to escape a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will so that people understand this is a real risk when going to the war zone - and that makes people give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane flying to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic Director Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court judge if elected president.
Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the next president will elect a person who is to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton would choose Garland with "quit with great certainty."
Reid's spokesman later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "tuck the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Columbia County.
Reid says Republicans who block Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commanders" and "desekeepers."
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong as well to women as men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and introduces a calendar made in the style of the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity plot models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his paper, which exudes nakedness, is different from the playboy magazines of the old school, as he said, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nudity, where men too, can enjoy and be inspired by these female body-catching images," says in a press release about Shaw calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to model calendar can send their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comment section with the nickname EivÃ¤All LonelyCentral Men, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov research company, behind the new coming of much spoken vinyl records is not a millennial generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is middle age nostalgia.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Nor is it just a matter of enthusiasts' desire to hug records, but the meaning is emotional: older buyers of vinyl records are a little more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog was a televised news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the lively Soho Street, wearing a jewelryless grey jacket suit. I would be busy, bend my hand to a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, however, there are still a handful of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a while as I pick up very close to the men visiting these stores and try by observing their age and character.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (customers at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably in their twenties) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time exploring the store offering.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I think I'm going to be," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent a picture to me by email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his available income. He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they originally appeared, and buy things he had to sell when he had been sold when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of things in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that buying vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who like their own company, and add, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has detected a new flow of people that has been affected by media jumping, and these people have heard of the arrival of vinyl records again and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on the discussions I have usually given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the vinyl-sensitive boom of certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional meaning of the audio discs?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset with a contactless payment system.
The digital world may be overwhelmed by some vinyl fans, for which returning to familiar record cases means persistence and resembles the days of happiness of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a hole or material property is acquired for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"This is how I experience it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others do.
It's an easy way to get your thoughts elsewhere."
"We're like social workers!" swoop Wez's co-worker behind the record stack.
A April ICM opinion study revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
An opinion study also reported that 41% have a turntable they never use, and 7% of vinyl board buyers do not have their own turntable at all.
At this point, I'd probably look like a serious face while I was browsing a stacked Bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also accompanied by the "pocal phenomenon" that Jonny, 42, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe movement (customers at the moment, three middle-aged men).
"One customer recently came to the store and said he didn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Fop, where I arrive next. The movement has owned a whole layer for vinyl records.
Customers include couples in their 70s, photo-taking tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is delighted, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of jazz swinging from speakers, Wild Beasts' latest sex-drinking synthesizer pop.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to determine the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watched various board records.
He's looking more than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect records.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the liquor is ...", he lets the infatuated sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a group of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jeans shorts but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled on the albums of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they are just an interior element and part so high that they don't even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all means to get attention to these records may mean more money in the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group that is most likely to have more time and money than most people also has the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
Although my research suggests that YouGov's results are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won't spend their Thursday mornings in the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a television host, staring frighteningly and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate â€” video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to Haiga researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged 272 to 512 years in the study, a female with a five-metre length.
French court rejects application for demolition of jungle camp stores
A French court has rejected the application of Calais authorities to demand the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing held this week, Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary trades established in the refugee camp. Shops sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks to the residents of the refugee camp and offer haircuts. From temporary restaurants, you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais' prefect authorities, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian auxiliary groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals offered by a state-supported organization and other entities are not enough for the ever-growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered Calais' prefect's concerns to be "fully understandable".
Judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe at the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice to hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp with the most vulnerable status.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring a children's cafÃ© to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, it would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that since the sharp increase in summer arrival rates, the population of jungle camp has risen to a record, over 9,000 lives.
Food prices fall clearly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food is falling sharply in Finland to the pleasure of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen the most in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
In the UK, only in the UK, food prices have fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are reflected in the article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices proportionate to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also affected the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place of low-cost food, although the price of food has fallen extensively.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from similar countries.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, VAT must be halved to the average of the EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he makes at VAT percentage are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
Those returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guide that all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells us the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, schools start practicing coding.
Swedish education begins in sixth grade at the latest, and social doctrine is already being read in four.
However, the biggest change concerns the role of students.
It used to think that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how they try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as ice sharks, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed only by the Icelandic clam, whose oldest known individual has been dated to 507 years old.
Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, followings only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He determined adult ice sharks from 28 females left in fishermen's gears.
The age of fish was revealed by radiocarbon timing of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cent amazone fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 sellers will not be reduced
Nearly 300 employees are fired from Stockmann, a department store company.
The companies in trouble ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction of about 300 jobs, the majority of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It says that the number of sellers in department stores is not reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 support employees are offered new work as a seller.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of them, the need for reduction was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction in the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realised during next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of â‚¬50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store still makes a loss.
According to Stockmann's vt. CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not achieved the goals set by the company.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex in particular.
The chain achieved its best second quarter net sales and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales will decline from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona LÃ¡ng.
There will also be rain showers in the middle of the country, but further south is pout.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the rainy areas of the north, we stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shakes doping scandal - a strange explanation for coach's rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as an athlete for the national team in the doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team leadership, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials turned in to Anzrah's authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home, as he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use," Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino said to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at the time.
It is not yet known whether there are consequences for the runner as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is in advance of Rio's winning favorites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah was only running with an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everyone?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubberizes its emptiness
Where is everyone?
Not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow athletics.
A struggle for athletic medals began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first day morning games and 65 percent of the tickets at the evening games have been sold.
The other was in London four years ago, where the stadium was bulking out of the cheering people.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The disappearance of the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have seen thousands of empty benches in rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stands was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only 30 percent of the 12,000-person stands were full.
The bad sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
Even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
Competition organizers spokesman Mario Andrada said this weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium was enough empty places in the morning.
Even the beach volleyball Copacaba sand has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
People in the galleries were enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and communities can redeem rights to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire the right of holder for payment.
The holder receives a veto for its 187 square square meter block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Obtaining a court of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go to carry banners or chain themselves somewhere to protect nature," Juha LeviÃ¤kangas, who acquired the right of control for his company, explains.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information in their block, which allows, for example, to visit the block.
The Foundation's website shows the name information of those who acquired the holder rights on the same map where the block information on the land can be found.
LeviÃ¤kangas sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act somehow unethical or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of nature areas so that they are allowed to be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It mainly funds its operations through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the worst of the big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves are most tormenting Turku from the large cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and parts of them per thousand inhabitants in the ten largest cities this year's January to August.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police reports, they took place four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, double theft occurs relative to the population compared to others," says Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer to that.
"The prevalence of theft can be influenced by how much you move in the city on wheels and how much wheels there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu Ã„hÃ¤s.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike theft goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and a lot of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a different type of city where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In Finland, there have been slightly fewer bike thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police report just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
It means 50-60 fillars every day and about 4,000 bikes per year in Helsinki alone.
"They're in large quantities," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only some victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime about bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police are reported.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where police get information about theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases in connection with another investigation, when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in a drug case in the apartment," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the work itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo LeppÃ¤mÃ¤ki.
According to him, bikes are stolen from bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, for example, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen as in previous years Jopoja.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term own use, for example, but a large number of stolen wheels end up on sale, for example, via the web.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not come to the police that stolen bikes would go abroad much," Reen says.
Buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns, according to police.
Some must buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the wheel used must be careful, as he may commit a hidden crime or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if the wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nopsa for the duration of his working day to the Kallio Library's shelters in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, the Moose says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk so far."
"Perhaps this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be hipster value here," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike stuttered the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in some fixed, such as a bike rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose hull alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from friends that the bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad wheels, such snot-Jos."
A bike was stolen from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, so Valve knew how to wait for it to be usurped.
Under 15 years of age to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-to-peer crews from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to those under 15 years of age who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury is missing in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"Everything is guided by the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that not everything would be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, a young person does not face an adult panel but reflect on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer of Palmu, which followed the experiment, Iikka Lovio, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of those under 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that you're choosing on the road you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project of Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to all those in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it.
The paper said the open letter was aimed at Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party money to be directed to the congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence, and record disfavor, threaten to bring a sound avalanche to Democrats in this election," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only directing all possible funds to the congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti- Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
Politico said Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not to support anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy would go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of the rich, partly through private money.
The building program is a handhold for American due jobs who suffer after factories moved to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it's gonna have to pay the withholding tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"As president] I am opposed to any trade agreements that work against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program released by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "only favoring millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed sharp discount on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making the products himself in America," Clinton said.
Such are Rio ratings: The races have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of viewers so far.
At once, the races have glued to the screens at best 12% of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Championships in Athletics a month ago received nearly 800,000 viewers at a time for TV2, and the European Football Championships are well over one million.
So far, the most interesting of the Olympic sports have been the cycling of Sunday night and the rack gymnastics that both reached nearly half a million spectators for the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Head of Sports, is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that viewers are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports race to which Yle has owned an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are viewers from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio race broadcasts will come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a lame interest - if it is now considered lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the initial races, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other species interested in Finns: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't have the ratings on the web until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired by all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has come and the defects have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with a delay and other small technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are visible in Yle's canals and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech conveys races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but the last ones that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in RisinselkÃ¤.
It may be even deeper.
Technology diving trainer Matti Kannela found a print of about 20 square metres in Ristiselta, with a dive computer looking 104 metres to depth.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great JukajÃ¤rvi, 23 meters.
Looking at this way, PÃ¤ijÃ¤nne does not reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction of August 12 at 2:29: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in middle depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on the tax sale: Taxation of pensioners is still more intense
The taxation of pensioners remains more intense than wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance came up under parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think that should definitely be in it.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners had income reductions that eased taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in Parliament who grilled the then finance minister Alexander Stubb (c.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
In the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (doc.), tax cuts are mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing purchasing power, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages of Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Orpo for the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been reached with effort.
He says that holding on to the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government term.
It is done by labour market organisations, so it should not be shaken by questioning.
It comes to need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith for the future.
Prolonging unemployment in a fight
The Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment in a budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties in Thailand attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to pursue Finns in Hua Hin in particular to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact people at Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there's no record of the attacker yet.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and a referendum on the constitution drawn up by a military junta last week.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, in turn, an ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population is smold, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, in the past, no attacks have been extended to tourist destinations.
There is a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks will affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thailand police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police said the attacks were "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, Thai police say, according to the AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours, after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourist-popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a tourist destination favored by Finns, four bombs exploded in the holiday island Phuket at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current reports say they did not require casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the magazine.
A total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani in southern Thailand and the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is through the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Ch, head of the military junta that controls Thailand, said the attacker is not yet known so far.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to Thailand have no reason to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions for caution, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the Finnish night and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about the attack last night in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where she believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack that exploded about every half hour.
Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-match
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second score of 60,098 and Alija Mustafina of Russia was the third with a 58,665 point performance.
Biles, 18, is still seeking rack championships at the Rio Games with permanto, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics in terms of the past few years.
He had eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permanno championships three times in a row as well as the boom last and the year before.
For the US team, Biles has achieved two world championships of the team competition.
The fainter World Cup medals in Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isk has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will result in anything more wonderful, Huovila, who worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies that hit Thailand near.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, then hardly this either.
Huovila's company office is located a few hundred meters from the blast site.
Huovila heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about nine local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the promenade and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace as usual this morning.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on because of the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
On the beach, many had not even heard of the attacks.
At 7:30 a day in Thailand's time at Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol observed two men suitable for description hidden in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of operating theft, theft and aggravated damage of the motor vehicle.
Police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director of Russian Leader Changes: Clear Moving Out
Russia made a high-ranking leader change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and was Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the cause of Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way to prevent people from building up power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been chained with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, is moving to special environmental and transport tasks.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the amendment to a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Perino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old curves, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri PynnÃ¶niemi from the Outer Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin changes his immediate circle younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as a human race to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human race to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbiji Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbiji, which is important to ISIS last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were then left in the city.
Fixed the previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we mistakenly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, the ISIS fighters actually kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to the STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Communications Director tells the STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run under the prestigious games against time.
He injured his butts in the early part of the season and was forced to skip the Jamaican Olympic Qualifiers.
This hasn't been a complete preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's a key issue," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Pori Bolt, the star of Jamaica has risen in an era when athletics have struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres in the time of 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and competitors' confidence in the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the clock.
The world records in Berlin by 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 at two hundred are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is seeking a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes that it is born but Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger of Bolt is Athens' 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth-seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost once in the finals of the Games if he has made it.
In Daegu, the 100 World Cup final was left by Bolt not running due to fraud.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympic Games that separate me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals about Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xiny's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping crime.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has brought his doping case to the CAS of the International Court of Appeals for Sport.
Xinhua says that signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide called hydrochlorothiazide had been found in Xiny on Sunday.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent a athletic coach home from Rio due to doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee IOC said Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
Media reports say it's Kenyan express coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich race pass in the situation.
There's nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in a 200-meter season of his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed season before Wang Shun, China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in an instant interview with Iltalehti.
The story of Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read this week on Iltalehti's website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed if there is a little noise in social media or British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress, which certainly has at least enough revealingness - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no rear steps.
It's important to look good, and little bits are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to scare and perhaps startled, but he emphasizes that he does not want to play the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus must be in athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that focuses on how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelto grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from (the host) dress.
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police filed two arrests due to suspicion of terror
Rio police announced on Thursday that it has arrested two people due to suspicion of terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety supervision of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group, the members of which were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages that call for violence had been spread in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of the Rio Games.
Police detonated suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-section match in the empty hall of the Rio Basketball Tournament on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
Police let the public in after controllingly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not reach the stands by the beginning of the match, because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only then let the public into the hall.
The pot woke up the Spanish team that started the race.
Spain, who started the two losses, won Nigeria points 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police already completed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling goal site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first-final game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentina's dam dressed PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren - Finnish ponders protest
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren was experiencing a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine dam dressed Tuuli PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening departure of the women's surfing day.
Winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck due to the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he did not want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn stayed in place 27 with the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is the eighth.
In terms of the tip, the crash was not much affected.
Friday is an important day to race the 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Special Things That According to Science Extend Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirect affect a person's health so that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that can't be affected by a person themselves can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to middle body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to spend... just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to determine the secret of long age with a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented the seven strangest research results.
Science says all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "small risk of death", especially in terms of neurological or heart-related diseases.
Again, studies speak for alcohol that moderate use - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental use can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on this blocking gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway investigated how laughing affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is considered, according to many studies, is good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in his life, he should also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility will bring more years, that is not disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute solvency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large butt had lower cholesterol levels.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won an Oscar at the Olympics, he is more likely to live further than a regular bolt.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long age is due to a person's social status - which, on its part, allows for recognition such as the Nobel Prize to be pursued, for example.
A study on shopping behaviour for people over 65 found that a person shopping daily, is likely to be older than shopping.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring forward death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping doesn't have the same effect.
Umpi-human drunk driver derailed into a truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car beak crash took place on Friday night.
The accident occurred in Koske, mid-Kontie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came against had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left up in its lane after the crash, but caught fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and beyond the ditch on its roof.
Born in 1972, a woman who carried a passenger car was squeezed in her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of a woman's blowfire was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sent loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to SeinÃ¤joki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in PerniÃ¶, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit the eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk sweets because Posti delivered our loads to SeinÃ¤joki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So if you don't rush in the lawn cutting, the sign said.
The sign that foxes the merchant is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting.
Grass cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me with a little bit.
Media representatives have been calling all along, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few patches were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed into the wrong place yesterday (SeinÃ¤joki) and we no longer left to do a partial delivery (Saloon) in three, but we only took five pallets today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
This was first reported by the Evening News.
Teija Haltia was not indignant in the sign because he found all her own loose candy favorites in the selection.
Dizzi weight loss! 30 pounds lightened Lotta Backlund released a picture of his change
The comedian producer has hoared tens of pounds since his child was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed at normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started his weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of pictures on Instagram for his soaring performance.
The picture shows how tremendously Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after picture pair has collected several commendable comments from co-evaporators.
You're great.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one glows.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
I get a terrible amount of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when you are lying on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds on the Let It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he finally wanted to get to normal weight, which was then ten pounds away.
During the three-month fitness course, five pounds eventually fell.
Wish of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Recollections of the victim for police dogs
A family of 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update to convey the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary station recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work fearless.
Good friend.
We still cannot fully realize that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own courtyard in KoskenkylÃ¤, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer's tracking involved police dog BÃ¶rje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
BÃ¶rje survived and is recovering.
The district court sentenced Posti for breach of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti was not entitled to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the District Court of Kanta-HÃ¤me in his judgment.
The district court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the detained salary and EUR 2,000 as a refund of discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have arrested only a part of the tutor's salary, which corresponded to the part of the induction throughout the day's work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU Association Decision of the Postal and Logistics Union on the prohibition of orientation.
During the November last year's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti employees will not familiarize themselves with temporary workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Journalists' Union.
Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In its letter, the Journalists' Association asked Sipila and Soini to express their concerns in favour of freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
SipilÃ¤ and Soini say that Finland repeatedly brought out the importance of freedom of the press and speech to Turkey.
Putin fired the chief of his administration to replace Estonian persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, the grandson of Communist leader Karl Vaino of Soviet Estonia, will be held.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax says.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration's chief.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close insider, will join the Kremlin's special tasks in environmental and transport.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other positions and proposed Perino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era for KGB espionage.
Many thought Ivanov was a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's withdrawal ban - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record of football transfers is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opened his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was a ban on Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event starring world-leading artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival event area is hidden with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a head stage and beer tent," says Thomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
Flow Festival, which will be held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors like to go to?
It is quite different in event productions that we think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow will be sold out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people last year by 5,000 people.
This year, the festival will feature a group of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things need to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that is controlled in huge pathways.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over 13 years with 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grass.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, a tent of 15,000 people will be the venue this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
The greatest joy and award for the work done for Kallio is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early 2000s of the event, the operations were very dependent on the city of Helsinki's support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company running Flow was approximately EUR six million.
It can be used to produce "cres things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out primarily with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan group in his own genre, but he has not the most typical performer that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because it is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and she's been doing damn good gigs in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samomer Yoosumra said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector living in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb has exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was favored by Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai authorities say the bombings are likely to have rebel forces that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police have recently seized the activities of criminal organizations that are engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby sets will first go into battle in a war situation
In Akut, in a war situation, conscripts are not ordered for combat missions until several months after the military oath was sworn, says Keski Finland.
According to the Defence Forces Education Manager, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, interviewed by the magazine, for example, of the garrisons serving 5.5 months in the war situation are only those who are in the final stages of their education.
According to the Head of Education, reservists belonging to the readiness forces are first assigned to the service.
No conscript or reservist is ordered for a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it emerged that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations even during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for homehouse
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a tough dispute about the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of a two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after the trade, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused microbial growth dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in a demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It maintained a district court judgment ordered the seller to pay a price reduction of 150,000 euros to Tola and Waroma.
In addition, the seller is forced to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs for a total of â‚¬47,344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the apartment had already been known to buyers when making a housing store.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the errors of construction were substantially more serious than had been made.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola said in the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically sought a home in good condition because they did not want to take the repairs.
He had had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the fitness inspection report were no harm.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters flowing along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left to the impression that rainwaters from the rock should perhaps be controlled slightly within a few years.
The shops were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it emerged that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 the building found microbial growth, which, according to Witnesses, were due to both rock rainwaters and capillary ground moisture.
On the west side, the house of microbial-polluted air could also get indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast that allows health risk, above the limits, was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also argued whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit.
The terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, based on the information they received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that the Court of Appeal had no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - also Finnish people in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter how the National Archives in Maryland, USA, about a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi brides.
The documents and license cards come from the racial agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Office was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the matter.
The Race Office investigated women's backgrounds, among other things, by studying church books.
The intention was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also required to be prepared to abandon their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency handwritten biographys and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Race Office wanted guarantees that women were "lovers of children", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who knew very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The case does not state what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-supported program known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program provided that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside the marriage.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the U.S. Holocaust Museum website reports.
Instead, Nazi demographic policies focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for receiving children.
The German mother's honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Sire's sixth, Nirkko got up and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first departure of the Finnjolls Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but was the peak of the whole crowd in the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren fought RS:X-class day departures in places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, PetÃ¤jÃ¤-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained at number 23 at the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤'s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: "I was so stiff"
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ has been a member of the Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, who has reached the cruise ship's bartender to 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance pallets and festivals, is still staggered and is currently in a wild lift.
Jari SillanpÃ¤Ã¤, written by Mari Koppinen, a book about the life of a favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ tells about his life and career for both good and bad.
SillanpÃ¤Ã¤'s career rose to a total rise as he won the crown of the tango king in the SeinÃ¤joki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka KuoppamÃ¤ki had composed a tango song for SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
The fairy tale castle became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song, however, did not go quite as planned: SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so on the canvas!
Bridgehead recalls in the book.
The recording of the song that became a huge hit would not immediately guess it was sung in a hangover.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the mark was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand a perfect and top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence about the man's most popular paragraphs, which the book reports, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ resigned from his partner at the time and the case eventually ended up in the texts of the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Sarah TÃ¶rmÃ¤s were not what SillanpÃ¤Ã¤ would have liked.
Bridgehead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about divorce were not true, but it was written based on the news of 7 days.
In the newspaper's news, the difference between Jari and ex-love was reported to be Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was full bullshit and was not true.
Jari called the book furiously to the record label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting for their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the polls of the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagd for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a scrapped booth in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In his latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is responding to the Brexit disaster from the profession.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of the position of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed people, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real British.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
They were particularly perceived by the BBC equity, which gave as much room for economists representing only a couple of percent of the economists who support the EU difference as the overwhelming majority.
The EU hostile press was not interested in explaining what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letters combinations of the difference are.
Those distant letter combinations spoke facelessly about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if economists' messages were both listened to and understood, they were not cared about, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not have common interests.
Academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small cities and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is an economy too
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant is congested by your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafÃ© has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Each health center's waiting room can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical times if they didn't exist?
Each school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the right British children get a school if they were to get rid of them?
Every municipality is home to foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and if they succeeded, their answers did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security, thanks to immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A more detailed preparation for the victory of the camp in favour of the EU gap began to be prepared a few weeks before the vote in case the result is broad.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large-scale liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We wanted to grow cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund that the news was about.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth Â£3.5 billion at the time.
In total, the company's funds are worth about Â£20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even below it.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed trading
When the camp in favour of the difference between the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These together robbed the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good due to the cash collected, but it too had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they didn't really close trading, but changed pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is now worth pulling the money out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most withdrew the announcement.
Since then, it was quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds, for example.
However, there were many surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds' trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
Open funds, which were covered by closures, dominate about 4% of British properties.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed to 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have become downwards, but the situation does not look "humor" for Aberdeen.
The main issues are now about the future development of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and the market also has a 15% discount sales compared to the period before Brexit voting.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit increases in London real estate market
At two in the morning, the situation didn't look very much yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power word was in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B's side now," Vanhanen says in his other home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
The City of London was already completely alive despite the morning.
TV screens normally made silent at the office exhausted the news, and usually the loud people were completely quiet to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell him about his divorce.
When the market opened, the screen terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought he would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate stores after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the British real estate market, and especially in London.
In London's office facilities, up to 20% minuses were anticipated in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still in the air.
It is not visible on the face of Vanhanen who spent its last summer holidays this week in Helsinki.
He still thinks it is far too early to say a lot about what comes from Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference will happen and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information has already been received on the development of the London real estate market.
The data from the real estate service company CBRE on price development cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, 6.1 per cent minus, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equal drops hit the years of crisis in 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting even because Brexit was compared quite quickly with Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The old man thinks the parable is not quite apt, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is another.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity," Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally found.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway
In fact, he does not think the price correction movement is a miracle - that could have been ahead without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other first cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
The drop started really high.
London prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, London's population as well.
Another big trend is that properties are the last ownership class that is globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment targets abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt leverage has now been used clearly less than during the 2008 boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, prices leveled up last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was some turn to be expected, and now it came.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He dares not judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or even going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the pit is solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of its victim.
If you have dispersed, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail than before
Soon S Group knows what you are eating, as the trading group said today that it will start collecting even more accurate information about the purchases of its regular customers.
Once information has been collected from the total of the receipt so far, the group will start to hug it from the purchased products in early May.
S Group will come after Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing with permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousomas.
He said Kesko is not going to react to the S Group registration change.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups, according to food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Interest customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not planned for now.
Suomen LÃ¤hikata has its own First Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product groups, we remain at the level of the receipt total.
So we know in which store the purchases were made and the day and the customer receipt total.
We haven't gone to that level like K Group or S Group," says commercial director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program was to be reformed in the future, but LÃ¤hikauppa will tell you later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
Basic information has included not only personal and address information but also the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total purchases and payment method are stored from the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, the information from S bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
As of the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodi Terro and ABC chains, data are recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in the bags anyway, whether you want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S Group website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever's puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes placed in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila to play it with its favorite toy.
A jar of shells for powder gas was revealed from the box next to which Heila sat.
The powder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and online store admissions
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports when necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened," says Customs Chief Inspector Mikko GrÃ¶nberg.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog for Customs' duties is mail items passing through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet store, up to 40 million mail items run through the airport each year, including military supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, and their precursors from Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be a big benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research," says GrÃ¶nberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
GrÃ¶nberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to train with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says GrÃ¶nberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are the six drug dogs of Customs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The choice criteria for the dog selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be reached at home without Hello, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from one-time.
The cameraman of the Evening Messages loses a camera mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila immediately returns a cover that looks like a soft toy from the "gir" command.
Hard competition for work dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether education is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet the dog on top of the work vests, reminds us of Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to their owner's care.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active sections last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for as the owner of Heila.
Luck hit Suntion, which has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than one million people in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has ordered August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off is held the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 pounds after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy withdrawals, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds of work in Rio and 145 pounds for the rapture.
His combined result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push for 175 pounds in his last, as did the other.
On the third company, the weights rose with wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of a Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian nodder Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian nods Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and whose threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over ten player agents with over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, the crowd began to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday in SeinÃ¤joki, where the Rovaniemes meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became a need for a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
A daring Modern Family star is shining again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern Family comedy series, again, Ariel Winter blinks by introducing his voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder.
The star has posed in its photos on social media in very few clothes and had numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter on the eve of adulthood has also recently released several pictures of itself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show up, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from child star to adult.
He has been on television almost his whole life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more revealing the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so tough, one woman on Winter's Instagram says.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge you not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration for many women, glowing a young woman.
Japanese prefer to Finland from the Nordic countries - tourists are attracted to the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract the Japanese to start the Northern Lights trips already in early autumn," Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations for Japanese Northern Light Tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly combined with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is very demand for winter northern lights in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Light season starts from early autumn and continues far into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake surface reflects the northern lights making the vision two-fold fairytale, says Anne Lind, Vt. Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Light campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would miss clearer unique attractions from Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 race when Fiji's champion team won gold
The UK's impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was crushingly broken when Fiji won it in the finals played at Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday by 43 to 7.
Fiji taught masters teaching in ball processing, moves, side illusions, support game, running lines and brutal power, thus winning gold â€” if there was the first Olympic medal in all of its history.
The loss meant silver, a slightly larger comfort for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-time rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win from the Czech Republics in South Africa by Chapter 7 to 5 semi-finals earlier that day could have negatively affected the team in finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
The UK may bring comfort that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite a bit for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started excellently and presented his tackle skills to the UK as for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had come across a number of moving buses, and world champions took 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a crash at the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation was 12-0, and the UK had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the rocky Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn't slow down Fiji's way for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored on the right corner, after which the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal from the further start, with more than a minute left of the first half play time.
Vatemo Ravou then crashed through even more powerless tackles of the UK team and crashed over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in the situation 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians are like born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the sport in the role of an apprentice.
Which is much true.
The UK made large-scale changes in half time and managed to hold back the Fijians for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team game of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation 36-8 by scoring the UK at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the archipelago people of the South Sea, whose fans at the stands sang, waved tickets and danced.
Fiji's pure joyful attitude was hard not to admire.
Mata Viliame scored a final touch on the Fijians' cake by finishing in the last moments.
The whistle rings, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, perfectly crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won in the Japanese semi-finals by 20 to 5 and the UK had squinted past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the equal situation was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling footwork and crashed from under the paint poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, a brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
More emotional than this, gold could not be in these games.
From the first draft to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed with 220 winning bets on history and found additional purpose for his golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the oars, the third voice of coach Robin Williams echoed in the boat, which encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was already the 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water surface like swans age does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has taken the two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is a coach who diagnosed cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little thought."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say in such circumstances like this.
"I needed money, so I had to improve quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own unrest.
Stanning, captain of the Royal British Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says, "I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cashier have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so a crazy thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any races in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their competitors have failed to match.
Up to the last 500 metres, as the twos of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught in the moment.
Helen said "Stay with me, stay with me".
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We got lucky to leave well, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We didn't pursue the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two think about a year before deciding on their future.
Glover celebrates next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with television nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to switch Panama leak-crapped government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are claimed by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes with tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election Day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the autumn election result.
In the June presidential election, the criticality of those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claims Obama was founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest noises.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton also involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that down, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslims prefer to cover the use of burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited by anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manner and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear, which grandly express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to ISIS attacked church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - in PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi blue-leak seam
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue algae opacment has been observed on the shore of PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, environmental operations in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the operational limits given in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E.coli and enterococcal levels of the water on Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue-green algae morning observed on the shore of Lake PyykÃ¶sjÃ¤rvi does not yet make the water sleepable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, forming blue-green algae mass in rafts.
Environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If the blue algae opacity turns into blue algae bloom, the bathing beach bulletin board will also be announced separately.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in next year's budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on forest farm generation change.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal has four goals: to promote generational changes in forest farms, rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, increase forest farm size and increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good," comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forest Director of the Confederation of Agriculture and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism of the tax change proposal.
Forest gift reduction is presented for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal assumes from it, by making a reduction in clean capital income in forestry, prevents the loss of forestry capital income, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if it doesn't sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the forest's return value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high in the opinion of Hakkarainen.
As such, it cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner, he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the holding.
In forest policy, forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hail shower surprised motorists with Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special rearing in the Kalajoki Himanga on Friday morning.
According to the rescue department, two cars driving in a row derailed into the ditch, after which the one who came behind collided after driving ahead.
According to the on-call firemaster Harri Pyyhti, the derailment of the ditch is suspected of being caused by a strong hail.
There were two people in the car behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that drove before was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga a few miles towards Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results of researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effective.
The findings made by the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research team show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignant nature of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments may be able to improve by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family house killing continues at court, prosecutor claims murder sentence for other perpetrators
Muhos' family house killing continues at court for both convicted people.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years 4 months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of gross endangering road safety as a young person and the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The district court's sentence was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and a man with a more severe conviction.
The prosecution calls on a man who has been punished to be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to the district court, 17-year-old young men killed a man who worked as the instructor of the child welfare unit in the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had gotten out of the grip and trampled the young person into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
Among other things, the director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental state study, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had planned to escape a family home since at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing until the age of 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed by an ice shark, reports a study published in Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic such as Greenland, an ice shark, or holker, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not increase until the age of 156.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only a centimeter a year.
Only a species of clams are known to live longer than the ice sharks.
The researchers discovered age with radiocarbon timing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - though the throw one way or the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
Up to one third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary when he introduced it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a really staggering amount, $1,000 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's discount 33.
The inheritance tax would be waived altogether.
Trump accused the state of excessive regulation of business and driving small businesses bankrupt.
The decided environmental standards for the rash must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector is dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be discussed again.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump said the "smooth" trade policy is one of the main causes of the US problems.
Free trade agreements would be disbanded.
There would be a 45% penalty tax on imports from China and a 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American aircraft to connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel lifts new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his habits, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite the fact that it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday for Finnish time.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea is fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street grain - accounting with the past can begin.
It summed up the essence of Pedro AlmodÃ³var's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous steering job Travel Lovers (2013) was a tiny and ronskin-sided satirical comedy, the preceding Skin I live in (2011) the peaks of a Spanish artist's career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a serene love, relationship and family drama of conventionally, with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is amazed all the way to the rest of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times his daughter who grew up the stages of her life.
She begins the time before the daughter was born, at the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, a young teacher, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, a TV-supported time between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that it's pretty cleverly and literally with a one-time wipe.
AlmodÃ³var films often characterized by such ambiguity, up to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is a equally played, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite sad, with such elements of elegia.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there and in such a way that it begins to sting more slowly in the eye as a pure shape than a working dramatic power.
The characters in the film are affected by diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costume: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
AlmodÃ³var is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the tunings of the scene at hand, do not particularly improve.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is external and little lifeless.
AlmodÃ³var has written a script on the basis of the three short stories of Alice Munro, a Canadian Prize-winning Nobel Prize in 2013.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
AlmodÃ³var has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flat-thick written literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably even more robust drama, so much big things - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro AlmodÃ³var.
Based on Alice Munro's three short stories.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are carried out by a roap shop.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha SipilÃ¤ (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (c.) under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as social security cuts were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic security of unemployment and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
Municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so hard that no new cuts are being made on these?
Because next year is election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes different directions from government parties, will ruin the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the government party of the Finns Party expects a sludge loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest by 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, many of whom will be realised next spring the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the governments of the three parties about as large depends on the fact that the British can last.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also come to the surface.
The new cuts will not come, first of all, the fact that next year they will be done violently and secondly, trying to soften the historic attack on the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the SipilÃ¤ government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of a shift in debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take debt of EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own program: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to hold on to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session on top of the former.
The budget would be ravaged at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will be accepted what comes.
With these measures, debt is not folded
It is quite clear that with the current actions, indebtedness does not fold, no matter how Juha SipilÃ¤ tries to foment a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti HetemÃ¤ki at the budget bulletin prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimal, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR three billion more per year than in 2008.
In the curves presented by HetemÃ¤ki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will reach 70% in the mid-year.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party of what is responsible.
Survey: People want to leave a lot of tasks for municipalities
Three out of four believe that the organisation of children's day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, is evident from the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also scroll responsibility to an individual municipality from libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The province, on the other hand, is the most obvious desire for provincial zoning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with intellectual disabilities.
None of the tasks responsible for the order of municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from the police patrol in Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half a.m.
The police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from which to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the more fast-legged police ran to the fugitive.
The blow faith for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross risk of road safety.
A truck in the stone cargo fell into the ditch
A truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch in PolvijÃ¤rvi on the Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on his side to the ditch.
The rescue services lifted the injured driver through a door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
The vehicle was left to the owner of the car.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on Ilmajoki
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki Lahti Village in South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman with white hair that extends under the jaw of about 165 centimeters.
Observations and clues about the lost movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre's tip number 0295440513.
Major accident ingredients in the air - see the destruction of the photo gallery Parafest
The surge flow that knocked down the parafest festivals caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Parafest Association in Joensuu, estimates that the festival will be financially noble, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer Kalle Salonen performed at the end of Friday night in the market.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 3 pm.
The program is held as planned.
The surge flow occurs in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a downward air flow.
Changes in the water state of the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the downward air mass cools and its pace towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute is reported that rush flows occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of crash flows is difficult to predict.
The crash flow hit the Joensuu Art Museum's backyard, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5.
Three tents fell down, there were about 200 people in total.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child who was transported mildly injured in further care.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an peers living in rural areas.
Fine particles that age the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, die of nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A Cac study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel walking around congested streets.
London residents may try to protect yourself from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed - pushed a man standing in front
He had moved rocks in his yard on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and gone to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor could push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Championship, will leave the series that will be launched in October from a better starting point than to memory.
The team has been together for three weeks.

Through Josban, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Cup since 2003.
Now the sixth races are already in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better in North American qualifiers.
I was working in the market and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The US was establishing a floorball national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at SM level as floorball.
The telegram was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoji hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM series with the university for the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with the game, he trained the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen were named to the national team
The Joensuu-based floorball club Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Eno-based Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen was selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In the Helsinki-based Wilderness, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men's national matches, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old defender Tatu VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen of Switzerland, Wiler-Ersigen, has recovered from the thigh diaper and is part of the national team's standard fleet with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of SeinÃ¤joki Gaming Brothers, was also named the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen, the head coach of the Finnish Floor, is the head coach of the Finnish Floor.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be settled this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over three days, medals are played in both adult and young leagues.
In collaboration with the SM final tournament organised by Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, will be eligible for the top six pairs of the rankings of each series.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, raised by ElimÃ¤ki's YMCY, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the Pessis Stadium.
I have not played in the adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in finals at home corners, Hasu tunnels.
The Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark into sports and gave good lunches to a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 at ElimÃ¤ki's YMCA's E-girls.
The top of the mind is too big a jersey, the knee pads on the ankles, and the staggering ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the club president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice for indoor volleyball counterbalance during junior.
A party has been played on the curve pond beach since the 1990s.
The activities have always been active in the toilets.
I also went to follow the junior SM tour races thinking that one day I would be there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from PieksÃ¤mÃ¤ki this weekend in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked duo's goal is clear.
The realistic goal we have a medal.
SM-gold, we still lack the prize cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
The weekend's appearance in Kouvola may be Hasu's last in front of a familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are waiting for civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow poured tents at the disabled event in Joensuu, the major accident was close
The crash flow poured three tents at the Parafest festival for people with disabilities in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one larger tent.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Firemaster Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the paper that the situation had the ingredients for the disaster.
The paper says the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly left as an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Koli started working as a continuation of their home space, along with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Kol.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt-taking and increasing the farm size so that the bread could come in the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since the little boy.
I have always loved to be on the farm, and now that I started myself as an entrepreneur, I have put everything on the game.
If you start something, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I really went into the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will still be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat cars, aims to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition for a young food producer in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until 21 August.

Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it's racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that converge absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an pineapple, dog, or character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unfurnished, features distorting tools to create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have received criticism, where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes slanted, distorted teeth and made the cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people.
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts refer to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread wide on Wednesday and it was written by the online publications The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat said he removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were fiercely denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the pictures were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward."
He adds: "It's hard to deny that a very tasteless Asian caricature is equated with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just "livelowface", but one taken to the derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that must avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience is made up of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean they are likely to expect discretion even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, these types of things are no longer very easily overlooked, as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, working as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published on Medium, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of value of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly leadership of white and men alone and ended his writing with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either the case that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions of this kind, or they also have colored as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to give their opinions directly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter designed to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For my part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not OK."
Congressional expert group says military officials distorted intelligence on ISIS
A Congressional expert group published a report on Thursday that officials of the United States Armed Forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what events on the field gave cause to understand.
The Republican Chairs of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee for Intelligence and Defense appropriations set up a team of interim report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts. Analysts say that senior military officials embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by Entcom's senior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of the anti-terrorism actions in the United States than the facts on the field showed, and were invariably more positive than in the analyses of other units in the intelligence community," reports a press release on the report.
"Centcom events are unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level policy makers," said Ken Calvert, a Republican spokesman for California.
"Centcom's management's mistakes extend to the top of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that have occurred in 2014 and 2015 that the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports ordered by Obama's administrations have been forged, it gives an impression of analysts that gives the impression that Centcom leaders had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were," the report says.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a large military assaulter to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," said Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
Republicans set up a working group after learning about the doubts expressed by analysts that intelligence on ISIS would have been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will follow more detailed results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process of evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, a senior democratic representative of the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "determined the publication of intelligence results, "broken the morals of analysts," and "considered inadequately divergent views."
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt its conclusions to the "pre-ordered or political official line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a study conducted by Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on a Pentagon Superintendent investigation that began as a result of actions made by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congress report as long as the superintensor's investigation is underway.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome the wholesome dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has other aftermath, in addition to seeking to determine whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the claims made last year called into question how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and to give honest reviews of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on ISIS is in line with disagreements over a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite protests by many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on intelligence of ISIS.
Officials say last year, Hooker's working group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes to refineries controlled by ISIS had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and thus was able to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the result of the study was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive estimates of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
United States wins fourth duel in women's land hockey and establishes itself in a showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning game, the goal of 6-1 against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of people who keep reading about the goals they make."
However, this he knows: In their Olympic tournament, the Americans have won four games and lost zero games and share first place in their group with Britain, who continued his winning streak while winning on Thursday with Japanese chapters 2-0.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which will decide which of them is ranked first in the six teams and the second.
The first person to avoid encounter a tough Dutch team that won the second block for a longer period of time.
No matter how it goes to Saturday's game, Americans have already raised a stir of their surprising success in these games, four years after it was last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first grabbed the ground hockey bat until the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel). He reached the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player ever.
The 2008 Olympics were missed by him when he did not make it to the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 Games, where he and his team did not see much successes.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace in London was not what it is now.
We've made a turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a paint account in the first half by hitting the ball near the knuckle.
India had come to the game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, squired to the middle field, hit the ball to the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, one hit had sunk each of the American goals.
Briggs is now living in his successful season,
Like Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic villa, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics inevitably come across.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming bat, moving from the archer to a swimmer, a swimmer to gymnast and gymnast to the triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or a fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympic student, charms with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would be visible and would be part of the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would be a good mind in TV ads if he were just a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic Light does not equally illustrate all competitions.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade are less known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breast swimming, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I want to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
In the United States, athletes have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never reached medals or progressed to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and Canadians have been grabbed by the women's side.
China Dong Dong and Canada Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because for uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognize in this context that I am not an expert, just a regular fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoon films in endlessly continuous pomping scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jump, i.e. species that combine essentially in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "stepboard".
Ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that hurles them at a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are criticized based on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries are competing for the trampoline gym. There are 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When pursuing gold, the metal brain must get further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the goal line or output wall, they also have another goal they are aiming for in televised reports, namely the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical â€” and even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little exhausting just to watch the games.
This trampoline provides a respite.
In Trampoliin, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not a move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down, and sinks back up effortlessly.
Of course, the species also includes a competition aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a intense rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympic Games can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1 p.m. local time and men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts both day at 2 p.m. local time.
In the middle of Olympic mania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that in the middle of the general hustle might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be raised by providing appealing male athletes and objectifying them â€” as the U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested â€” in that case Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new fan force.
A whole generation protestes in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly dissolved demonstrations requiring political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over the past few months, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to increasingly expanding areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
Human rights organizations said the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses said police fired and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos filmed at the end of last year or early this year show how security forces beat young people forced to stand with hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights official is now calling for in-depth research.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and it has always been difficult to move forward even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, research director of the African Sarvi project.
Ethiopia is Africa's second largest country since Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially Somalia, and few African countries, if any, will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model country of democracy, and human rights organisations have constantly reported the government's repressive policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed, and has no choice but to demonstrate their minds, it will erupt out," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at Central Etopia.
"The whole youth is demonstrating.
A whole generation protested."
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, from land use to the straitude of the government coalition from power.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last place that has been previously part of the opposition, as a result of which they now dominate the whole parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where the escalation situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that more or less defeated separatist groups in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that has been squatting under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only for the past couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many will be able to access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amharas.
Oroms and amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian Highlands have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oromas, a large proportion of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet dominates the army, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unmentioned illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors that mediated between the opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn entered Meles' boots for almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this to mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections that the government said first crowded and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer deaths than in the previous months, and unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders from farsighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But it has clearly not prevented the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government.
And the grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amhara town of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by tigres, and hate speech against tigres is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft, neighbouring Somalia, but the base is recently closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claims Obama was founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to pull back his words in the latest dispute in his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
Clarification raised new questions to the Republican side of the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters are also in a bully situation, who must try to defend his candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments he may not have meant.
Trump made a claim at an election event on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump completely fainted his speech on the tweet from the previous day, when he said in several interviews he was quite serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off his claim.
The latest hurricane rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself in sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained her comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that evoke a response in his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then "clears" one way or another depending on the reactions," says Communications Specialist Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows they are round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has turned his style even more pungent in recent days as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll conducted by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist on Friday reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while Florida is tightly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being increasingly focused on the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his sayings to be a legitimate, political speech," said Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in that before Obama, ISIS was almost an unknown, small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called "a team of lower series" and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it did not deal with the situation decisively in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of trembling his speeches and a discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators trying to find out about him, but he says they can't succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and said it would just show more clearly that he was not suitable for president.
A cafÃ© that stopped due to the rise of unreasonable rent opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly sleazy cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was made the payment method and did not have Wi-Fi but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafÃ© was priced out of its streetside position on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who took place Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals consider this loss of a cafÃ© to dodge under middle classing to be sad.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there is no longer a CBGB club, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, a new one is also being created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafÃ© in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafÃ© has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unscaught.
Coffee is still good too.
The owner and chief of the new Verb cafÃ© is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new cafÃ©, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, retained many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
bacon-cane-cheese sandwichs are available and capers and browned onion rings are available.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the cafÃ©, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months of holding a cafe, Rodriguez says he found that old regular customers started running in Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a list novel.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before the job and invariably ordered the same.
"I sat in a cafe every day over seven, like a plane, and there they already made my poibagelia with all fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders her standard product, but occasionally she varies from her bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge for the soap shop to take the old place.
Soap Cherie owners even offered to make a special soap, which is used to make Verbi's own cold stewed coffee.
"We may still take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafÃ© with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place for it so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the cafÃ©'s cold stewed coffee.
The cafÃ© may also expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of a cafe."
The dreary food of the Great Depression in the New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office room at the White House.
Known as a culinaryist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious foods of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the foy liver pasteur and Maryland turtle soup.
That day, his menu was more modest: devil's eggs (deciled Eggs) in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert from plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message for Americans how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, named Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food as the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed with a journalist to Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as a major stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was well suited to the discussion on eating a major depression period.
"The bites were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut moorx, liver, and bean gum.
They were made from substances that were cheap and inadequate.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grung.
"It must have pressed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the major recession years, the American dining table especially in the countryside operated on a buffet basis "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new inexpensive diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as crumbs and pot dishes became the main food, and pot dishes were called "a great way to utilize food residues" because chefs could cover not such attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the most central part of the American meal, became sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends, the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even healthy kitchen shock.
While conducting research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced oven onions used as a shortage-time dish.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onions do not fit together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was the head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, directed citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget holders and meet the challenge of making fluffy dishes like carrot-creampath.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the state leadership's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he publicly praised the simple food of his childhood on an iowal farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tux.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, with Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the foods served at the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the depression-time foods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple says it had started to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she couldn't throw food away.
"He was really afraid that you'd have to throw away food," says Coe.
"People even started feeling sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once from wind hats."
After the main food plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they made at home, the same thing President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, and adds that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sank our spoon in thick brown ATV.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe sang for the second time and a third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead full compensation for legal fees for hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A judge of the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to full compensation for the attorney's fees incurred by it for a legal dispute over hepatitis C patent with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was acquitted in June for $200 million in damages for violating two patents owned by Merck in relation to Gilead's successful drugs called Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge found Merck committed violations of false oath and other unethical practices.
In an action recorded on Thursday, U.S. Regional Court judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the attorney's fees incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the right of private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed forces have taken over the city of Manbiji from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have gained control of the city of Manjib in northern Syria near the Turkish border, when the last extremist organizations ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the troops said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) now rake the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF military council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced his 2015 tax return on Friday, which shows that her and her husband's income was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Secretary of State, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster from his book on his term in the State Department.
Clinton's vice president, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine still show a model for financial transparency," said Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
According to usual, US presidential candidates have always made their tax records public, even though they do not require it by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to a tax government check and call it the reason why Trump has not released his income records.
"Transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump Special Legal Adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump disclose his tax records until the checks are complete.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this issue and posted a video online on Friday bringing out prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release their tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades, not his public tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico online magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those who earn over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election event in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway multi-industry company is located in the same place, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says that he has also been audited by the tax government and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent real federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported the sum of dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled firecracker condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away near human settlement â€” elephants are being shaved by throwing condoms filled with chili powder towards them.
The way has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has launched a campaign with the American organization Nature Conservancy to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to rush elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen attitudes changed in these villages, as now villagers can be confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is alarmed by pointing with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this is not effective, the so-called chili cloud is thrown.
Mixed chili powder is put in a condom together with a telegram, after which the condom's head is rotated so that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads into the air a fine cloud of chili powder.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is the thrower that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle in the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab "call" - RT News
A French film director, a Jewish root, gave birth to media rage after revealing that Berlin's Kempinski Bristol Hotel did not mention the Israeli area code in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Shoah documentary, dismantled his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed â€” as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that Israel's removal from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the Kempinski Hotel management."
The reason behind the procedure even further shocked the film director.
Lanzmann said the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding that Israel's code be removed."
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "great shame".
"The case dismays and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is given that we are in Germany and this is the very hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Get out" was said in a publication that brought out the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel has denied the charges quickly, called the mistake that occurred, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the code list was never given," writes a representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets at Brazilian students demonstration
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to demonstrate against government public education system reforms.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement agencies tried to break up a group of students, resulting in using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by hundreds of students who wanted to show their dismay to the government's plans.
Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin has made a proposal for a austerity measure, which will close nearly 100 public schools and 300,000 students will be placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on walls where Michel Temer, who was in charge of the president's office, was temporarily opposed.
The students' demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protesters in favour of disfellowshiped President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate votes for an alert to this.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the sanctions were removed, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagary.
He said Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Russian companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The store was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagary also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian mission abroad in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries with a tourist volume, whose citizens were traveling in Russia for the first time.
And it's not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will break this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner to finish as the British win cycling gold
Callum Skinner in Scotland denied fame in a men's team print on the Rio velodrome last night when the British trio defended the championship earned in London in 2012.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner played an anchor he inherited from his compatriots Sir Chris Hoy, a Scottishman. The young man made the legend proud of thanking the finish line and catching the victory from the New Zealand team, which was considered a favourite.
Britain won a surprise win four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they were set until sixth in March at the World Railway Cycling Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner from Scotland was the man that British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship four years ago, set an Olympic record in time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny was pushing for the team's lead, which Skinner retained.
A large part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the speed at a larger gear, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old in Glasgow, says, "I am flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he deliberately fell on the track due to a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his words, and the British rivals had no means of complaint.
This time, there were no problems of this kind of victory.
Hindes says, "The atmosphere was like in London, all British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress in the last five months, a successful five-day velodrome is ahead.
As Kenny has shown with her abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one of the Olympics.
This would mean an account accumulation with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and also born on March 23 (a magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint that starts today and will be solved in three days.
Kenny, 28, Bolton, says, "At the moment I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You'll enjoy the win together with the guys.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the rank of a knight."
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-man team taxi.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, which was made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:5,1,659.
The first round and final (at 22.42) are competing today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention is certainly Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with competition officials before the time drive when the officials invited him to measure their length.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now be confident that its great track cycling team will take over the mid-term Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
Since the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst claims related to sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the velodrome on the first night show that the already legendary reputation of the UK is rising to the top at a perfect moment once again.
The future of Portland smelting plant at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of an aluminium smelting plant in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company that supplies electricity to the smelting plant said that one of the factory owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision made by the Victorian government earlier this year not to continue the subsidies to keep the factory operational.
Fixed 20 years of aid will cease in November.
Alcoan Portland factory is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Due to the cessations, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the smelting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electrical production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, resulting in the Anglesea power plant being closed last year.
Alcoan Portland smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculations that have been taken over the future of the factory for years, first caused by the Australian strong dollar and recently the price of factory production.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other owners of the smelting plant will also close their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Marubeni Corp, a Japanese, own minority shares from the factory.
AGL says it expects the Portland production facility to remain in operation, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelting plant will continue.
AGL says the agreements are so-called hedging agreements that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period of contracts is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million as a "predictation of contract termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to abolish contracts "does not affect Alcoan ... the capabilities to keep the smelting plant operating or secure electricity supply to the melting plant".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into force since November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now backed off from the deal.
Due to the weak financial situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelting plant in the state of Victoria, Portland and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL's Chief Operating Officer, said in a speech to analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant decline in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, it wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians true TV star Kendall as September Vogue Cover Girl
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, an advertising face of Estee Lauder and performed during Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the rabbit in a room full of my loved ones made me tears," Kendall wrote.
The cover was released was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashian series style?), a scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar fighters Rob and Caitly and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest), pretending to have forgotten their sister's cover picture. The video ends at a classic turn: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichÃ© and is used in almost all birthday periods of the degree programs (Seacrest says the words: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this public in some way.
For the performance of Vogue's September issue undoubtedly marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim could get to Vogue's cover before (he appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release per year.
A large picture book more than a number similar to a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The September issue cover star is expected to be released so intensely that in the previous two years, the images of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models that are celebrities.
An Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if she is more of the character who works in the model, he is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of his career, when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "nalls".
These feelings have re-porated as news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant sneezing of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the Vogue September issue cover model.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, she appears on reality TV, perhaps just a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people per year
Each year, the most vulnerable people in more than 160,000 countries are being turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will have for centres already at extreme borders.
Three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services in Queensland are already turned away from five people â€” most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, with already overloaded workload, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center, says that thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not faint its decision, Farrell said the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People from violent relationships, people under the uncontrollable and crippled debt burden, divorced families, unjustifiedly laid off workers â€” all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to hand over these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their customer municipalities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was filed against a lawsuit to threaten an employee with gun
A lawsuit was raised against the New York: Donald Trump campaign when no action was supposedly taken after its management had been told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened the employee with a gun while they drove the Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he expected months to deal with the campaign internally before he, according to his own words, understood that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "showed a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the barrel in Vincent's kneecap."
After a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same as Phillip.
"Even if a gun is not triggered, it will cause damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The action comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general rage when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of another additional clause" â€” considered gunowners and gun enthusiasts â€” can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to elect judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media removed his words from their context and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
Bordini calls for compensation from the campaign for indifferent response and Phillip for compensation for assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message asking him for a comment.
Phillip was not reached despite the efforts.
Charlotte's local news agency WCB reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to Phillip's consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has launched a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being â€” not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the point that was most interested in Heathrow, and as at the 2012 London Olympics we invested tremendously in the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics produced tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the areas around the airport.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow's expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always winning obstacles, but Heathrow answers every question asked about it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of the few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and increase the economy by Â£211 billion, bringing expertise and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great working group at Heathrow that has implemented on time and by remaining on budget with a Â£11 billion infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5 terminal â€” voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years â€” and the T2 terminal built in the middle of two of the world's most crowded runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a private investment of Â£16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for Heathrow expansion to guarantee the future of our trade and create the knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Righton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in ad block cat-mouse play
The efforts of companies earning their money from online advertising to distract advertising software has become cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block ad blocker programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it told us that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block social service ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad entry codes on its desktop site so that it is harder for ad blocker programs to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says he has figured out the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "such a balling between the open source ad block community and diversions has been underway since the ad block was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertisers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad blocker programs, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading advertising prevention programs in its desktop app, as the spokesperson says mobile advertising blocking programs do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads remains high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it will update the user settings advertising tool so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, as it also says they prevent some regular Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we're going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email bulletin.
"Advertising programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that is why we have invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
Woman commits suicide by dropping under cars on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for eyewitness help on the freeway for an accident that occurred in the first hours of Thursday, where the woman deliberately dropped under more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by lying on the dark road, and she was hit by more than one car," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and she was clearly aiming to commit suicide.
The woman died at the scene.
Police said many motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unrecognized, and police are asking them or other witnesses to the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical stage in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the motorists involved in the accident will be charged.
"Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It'll stay the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have occurred over the past five years, which do not consider motorists responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark motorway and the court decided that motorists could not expect to run into a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the prosecution against him after he crashed into a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one of the nights of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the way of driving the police â€” who was responding to an emergency call â€” was justified and the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation."
Anyone who knows something about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
NASA's new climate model estimates suggest Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes have been similar to that of Earth, although Venus is hot and anhydrous in the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by researchers, Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the Earth and has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine early Venus' topography.
The planet probably had more dry areas than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% fainter.
"In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daily side is almost two months at a time," says Anthony Del Genio, GISS researcher.
This heats the surface and generates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer works like an umbrella and protects the surface largely for the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than the current temperatures in Earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, for several billion years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned steamed water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, only a thick carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect â€” i.e. Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in team decision-making.
Colorado's vice president/Chairman Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have held my position as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as the club's vice president of hockey operations with great, passion and determination," said Roy, 50 in a communication.
"I have long and hard thought over the summer about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vice president of the coach and club's hockey operations must be fully in line with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as Avalanche head coach from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made it to the sequel in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the 2015-2016 season and was five points away from the Minnesota Wild while playing from another Wild Card seat at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career â€” two in the Montreal Canadiens ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say that the wage strikes for oil workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been held on drilling rigs under the control of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm that they agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will have several full-day meetings in the next few weeks where we will deal with problems with recent aspects.
Trade unions justified their recent activities, which they said was the first in over 25 years, in protest for possible maximum 30% wage cuts.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut about 9% of the tariffs of its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows the price of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts give it room for movement that is necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus working to enhance its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower crude oil prices and economic situation, resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June, are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish parliamentarian Dave Anderson met with working leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
He said the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need an economy that is beneficial to many and not just a few," says Anderson.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new North Sea projects, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures star rotation speed in Pleiades
The most recent mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the speed of rotation of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster so far.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times relate to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing results with other clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the star's weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching their adult age.
They are currently spinning faster than ever.
With the rotation rate at its peak, large amounts of star wind are erupted from the stars that grow up.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed rotation speed data suggest that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers â€” larger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see the "dance" of the Pleiads that slowly rotating are typically larger, while the fastest rotating are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory that allows star properties to be compared to rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models on the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
