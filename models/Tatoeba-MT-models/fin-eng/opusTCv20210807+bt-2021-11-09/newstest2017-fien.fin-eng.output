28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping mall stairwell this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and states, "His affairs finally went well."
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall shopping mall Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was determined to be a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as the line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family and he will be greatly missed," the spokesperson said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank stayed at the hostels at the beginning, but that recently "his affairs finally went well".
"He found an apartment and was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling together with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any dispute.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information is requested to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Demands for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial action measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the entire Council to support new industrial action since early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the deal.
Medical interns and medical students voted in July to reject an agreement that had been agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who voted.
In a letter released via Twitter on Thursday night to members, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "insistently silent" on the issues that, he said, led to the rejection of the deal.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new deal and call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to obtain a mandate for the gradual and expanding industrial action program beginning in early September.
As a result of the controversy, medical interns have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of the BMA medical interns, Dr. Johann Malawia, resigned after a vote had rejected the terms negotiated by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical interns and students that the agreement was a good one and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on England's doctors.
Russia and Turkey: a consortium of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands with each other and declare the eight-month-long battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands on the occasion.
But Putin’s smile seemed forced, and he did not exude much heat, even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke constantly of his "beloved friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels, but even to better ones.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion of Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an amazing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Putin received his demanded apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some sort of victory.
The benefits of a tough truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost ousted in last month's failed coup d'état.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
This number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved as flights eventually continue.
They are hoping for a late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has been predicting cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as formulated in the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, there is anger at the West for what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
Adding to the long-standing resentment over the snail-paced EU accession negotiations, comes Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and erode Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the spectacular seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to present a "group of outsiders", as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries who feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question regarding their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus as to where they can seek a common ground with regard to Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a total disaster with NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better for the two leaders to be on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international ambitions.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
In the meantime, bank strategists have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers but will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except head office and stock exchange listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a round of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's now time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank because basically (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win with a total of 3,000 wins
Racing rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone with his second win of the evening at his home track while competing with John Gosden-trained Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I am very emotional because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori sucks cheers at himself as he leads the Predilection out after the victory.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He is classy and strong, but his tactical wit sets him apart from the others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big races!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He’s a lively person who’s good for British competition, but he’s also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with his trademarked flyy landing from the saddle.
From flying stops to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
Massive wins at big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from competition for drugs.
Three years ago, he had a hard time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed remarkable strength of character in challenging the doubters and returning to his best condition.
And he might go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin has "ordered Ivanov to move out of the position of head of the Russian presidential administration", but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 2012, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has perplexed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet Security Service (KGB).
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting shown on state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the general election.
Is this just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website to Putin, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, one might even say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service (KGB), as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month on the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and disagreements on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the series about the FBI agent team can be expected later.
The 54-year-old who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have given it everything for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The start of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysterious fish found their way into the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be sandeel left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film footage of the apparition in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry overpass with the land bridge, meaning the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four brackets between the "deck fans", which are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rake ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit site.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work on this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this bridge section alone."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the barrier between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must be matched.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover of the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, chief of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first shutdown in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north column road deck, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, i.e. inland, side.
This was done by pulling the north fairway land bridge 700 millimeters in the south direction.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
The huge, because the land bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3% of the slope angle.
Demanding, because the allowed measurement deviations according to which the team was working were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
The three men are "lucky while alive" after falling off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alert at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop on Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued forward on its own.
"We saw the boat moving closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helmsman of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life-jackets.
The men were taken aboard a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a kill breaker rope, but it had somehow detached from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness.
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but that they would rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and participate in some activities.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then to video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed for video games in the 1990s (later on them came a cartoon series, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity had been somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was delayed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS, and that after discovery can be "photographed" (by phone screen capture) or "caught".
A generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users Cardiogram tracks.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Got, it only sees the training level data.
The calls of many public health campaigns to “find 30,” “get up on the couch,” and “be active every day” have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and cared for by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving derisionists look for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
And?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not provide a reason for movement in the same way as this game.
The charm of novelty disappears and the use subsides in time.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles grabs gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Energetic jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
I can't believe the permanon.
Great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-match championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
U.S. Simone Biles on balance bar at the women's rack gymnastics multi-match individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to consecutively win the multi-match championship, and the fifth overall American champion, while strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final experiment awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of over-expectation.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning a gold and silver medal (in this order) in a women's rack gymnastics multi-match in the individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he served as the culmination of the departure party for Martha Karolyi, the coordinator of the retiring national team.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes his trademark volt bypass - is adapted to Latin American music that would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a toddler by her grandparents, and found by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman coached, has become a force.
He has not lost in a multi-game since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He reached the top with boom points of 15.433 and surpassed them by getting 15.933 permanence.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears rose in Biles' glitter red, white, and blue bounded eyes when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of revenge from four years ago when he was in shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in a replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent out kisses to the public after his permanto performance in an emotional frenzy about the return, which at times seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old’s widespread tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl killed in the deadliest attack in Phoenix’s first serial killer case in the past decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The gunman, standing on the passenger side of the car, fired the handgun up to eight times and then escaped in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple killing does not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that had been carried by another adult victim.
A spokesperson for Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting prompted investigators to examine whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in a four-month period in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of the home," Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were done by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police release of the shooting, which occurred just half an hour before the triple killing, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, bullet seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'Situation gets easier'
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that she may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that she be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows how the signs Edmund invented are used to sign "Would you sing for me?"
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it’s not a standard sign language — he says Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a long time because I don’t expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hope-rich advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
Believe me, it'll get easier.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana as well as southern Mississippi flooded over their banks and posed a widespread flood threat due to extremely heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities, and that aid is already coming to counties in need.
Mike Steele, spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for high tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch will remain in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five centimetres of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding of Ascension County, lower along the river, as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, flowing south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest level ever at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking up people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says that the water at Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson living nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have injuries, and that he is the only one capable of swimming.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods will "quickly spread out" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was fully saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of residents of Tangipahoa County from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes had been flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been left surrounded by high tide.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have opened shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The most recent major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Rupert Lacy, the emergency director of Harrison County, said that steady rain continued along the Gulf coast.
He said that Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain still continues."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand, and abdomen, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the men aged 29 were reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was crossfire between several shooters at the scene.
Attack weapon-type shells, originating from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant struggle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and reports have been received that police are investigating the security camera tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It has also established the involvement of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to have consecutively won individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the last five) because in the next Olympics the gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoly's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts usually practice in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they began gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where many young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and school and work success.
This team inspiration is what makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and it’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We are living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious “girl power” by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to a healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical interns organise new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the deal, saying that the NHS was on "unknown ground", and that even minor additional delays will harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which includes changes to nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Internships Committee, said in a statement last night: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it is accelerating the existing labor crisis, and that it is not treating all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
Attempts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and, at times, deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical interns.
If he does not do so, the medical interns are ready to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointment times as nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as replacements for doctors on strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved deal with officials from the British Medical Association.
BMA wants better weekend pay for 54 000 medical trainees under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Employers' organization, appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Labour struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause concern, anxiety, and disruption to patients, caregivers, and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of the Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional education for those returning from sabbatical leave, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay gap in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England education organization and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A drug costing £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from two pounds a day from a paying drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for a longer period of time.
A blood clotting medicine, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for as long as 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these have a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the artery wall, which forms narrowing.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot comes off, it can travel with blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Initially recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to the many thousands of people who may benefit from it.
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, over a period of more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend treatment for longer than that period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles reproaches police, election supervisors and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
A former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, all the voters have to do is say their name and address.
The report even suggests that an incorruptible ink be placed on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls for wider access to the press for council documents and decisions made by informal committees or a working group.
"This would not only protect against election fraud, but would protect local government from a broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with election fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the voting scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about election fraud in the mail voting, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including proof of identity with ID
He says in his report, "Evidence evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"Worries were raised that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behavior because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists being allowed to deal with ballots from the post office in order to put an end to the 'collection of votes'.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for more stringent checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use an indestructible ink on the person’s finger so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automated postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling the sounds and envelopes that come through the post office, where the votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require only English (except in Wales) to be used at polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric beats up the Greater London Police Force, saying that it is "astounding" that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The Electoral Court remained as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities by Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
On numerous grounds, he was found guilty without a doubt, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticized the inefficient "tick-in-the-box checks" in the voting registration offices of city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a revival.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud, as well as the denial of the facts of certain groups, threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's cyclist double and other celebrity images at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have been confused by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger found on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how one particular archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his photos surfaced in which he looks frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, becoming aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I personally don't see a great resemblance, except maybe about the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons of London in 2012 will certainly come up this year as well: a striking resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, has been said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
For years, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shares more with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team resembles "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt," according to fans.
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw the similarities as well
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarities between the two
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. football star and Dexter’s actress do indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes After Saying Chinese Swimmer 'Dead as a Pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth enraged viewers of the CBC live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought her microphone was off when she began sharing some of her own opinions in the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay finals.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China bludgeoned, baby.
Too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message at the time of the second leg 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did a CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200-meter relay final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China bludgeoned, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group. #disgusting."
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized on live air for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We regret that a comment on the swim performance was on the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC apologized more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
Last night we quickly took action and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he has said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," she said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the swimmer's performance, not his as a person."
"It's needless to say that I didn't mean it as disrespect, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client dismayed by a woman who arrogantly fitted underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn’t know where to look when she took off her clothes in the middle of Primark’s shop to try on her underwear.
Things didn’t get any better when, after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she removed them from her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually matched four pairs of panties in a store located at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman fitted underwear and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children at the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything".
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of featured underwear, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her adaptable feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for reconciliation, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everyone was staring at him while he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same with three more couples before finally deciding he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or think about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, 33, who lives in the city of Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn't cleaned."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I understood that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's spokesman said, "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
This is how you can defend yourself from armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you’ve been approached from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay an attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "clear the line of fire".
You then grab a gun between your forearm and shoulder before punching the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by striking the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes from pain to pain, twist the gun from his hands, punch him in the face with the back of the gun, and back off with the gun pointing at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to launch.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you’re not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe’s dirtiest places for a travel guide
The British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Suffolk host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet, and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train flush button used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright spoke constantly to doctors and medical professionals about the strengthening of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him with anything else in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester of his intestinal endurance as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, ranging from public rail railings to the toilet seat flush button, did indeed test his immune system.
In a film made, he said, "Since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth starting with dirt, worms, and muddy water."
He confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of more than 4,000 units on the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the freshly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, The Inner Force, together with the Finnish dairy company Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting in here.
The internal force was produced together with the Finnish dairy Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilusta, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help boost the gut bacteria and immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian'."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell more about it to consumers in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: "Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the gross Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things to lick were easier for Ian, while some were quite tricky.
I'm glad we managed to save some of those dirty licks."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of bullies destroyed a rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The bully family caused £50,000 in damage to their rented house after they were evicted for terrorizing neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about numerous times.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, shocked housing company officials stated that the property was in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, floorboards had been torn, debris had been spread on the floor, and walls had been tarnished with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, manager of Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of points to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is disreputable, and their name is disreputable."
The couple had three sons who occasionally lived in the property, and according to police, the family's tyranny involved street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive screaming, arguing, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behavior.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of demolition were found to contain old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have been supplied in the past, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street, and that police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It’s wonderful now that they’re finally gone.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident took no responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last course considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, by the Devon and Cornwall police, and by the courageous community members who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms
Housing company employees now have to clean up the waste piles around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as a scale, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug as an intention to distribute it onward.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless now after being left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were graffiti.
Police say they are seeking to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior. The police will continue to work with their collaborators to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew on the beach at a low altitude
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane sweeps by from very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised
At this very moment, horrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost within touch distance of sun worshippers in a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see what was coming at them from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It went by twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
This summer, fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low altitude due to conditions that hindered visibility, smoke from wildfires and thick fog
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote’s results for the first half of the year better than expected
Etelä-Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a profit of EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment was carried out in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues.
The exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Swore in Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in on Friday.
A military oath ceremony for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The oath ceremony of the 10th Special Frontier Ranger Course was held on the garrison's sports field.
The military was sworn in by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to join the Special Border Rangers.
250 of them were invited to take the entrance exams.
Special Border Rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the oath was attended by five veterans of the wartime frontier forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has operated an RTA unit, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The chief of staff is an inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the working methods of the police.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the scene until they received an alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police work is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units, and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas subdivided according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's task is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, the perpetrator forms a certain kind of image.
The placement can be done either on the basis of the manner in which the act was committed or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of the methods used, both by themselves and by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
The police will publicly disclose the procedures if they anticipate that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which empty homes were marked in early summer, used in house burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis team has found that the most professional criminals are learning from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the minutes of the district court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves will go with their gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
This is due to the reduction in the number of employees and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
ISIS schoolgirl killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has been rumored to have died in Syria.
Attorney Tasname Akunjee said that the girl's family heard that she had died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrikes on Raqqa, the organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just while planning an escape from a war-torn country and her return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a gravestone and a testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to war zone — that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Garland as Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicts "with some certainty" Clinton would choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "hang the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "minors" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says the nude calendar is "for women as well as for men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s-inspired Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of nude celebrities, they plan to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude photos is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar's for them, too.
"We need to start presenting timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a naked female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before rushing to fill the comment section with irritated insults written by the pseudonym NoAllLonelyMiddle-agedMen, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-spoken rebirth of records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing of the middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, people in the 18-24 age group are less likely to buy discs.
It’s also not just about collecting enthusiasts, it’s about emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the YouGov results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign up livelyly before stopping, form a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, such as, "Let's look at it in more detail."
Let's take a closer look.
While the charm and dirt of Soho is slowly being removed — hotels, chain restaurants and stores, as well as office supplies stores are now filling buildings that used to have independent stores — a handful of stunning specialized record stores are still left.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops as I try to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, likely in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and tours shops to spend a few hours.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the photo above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
She agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my evil."
25-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit into YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and that there has been a need to buy back their old records.
Based on the discussions I have had, people have gotten rid of their collections usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records back," he says.
This can explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured especially by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar disc covers; items that evoke memories of teenage fortune days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It’s an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers!” another worker suddenly said from a stack of records.
An April opinion poll conducted by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had purchased a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyls do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I browsed the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, who is also working at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a big part, but it will definitely happen.
More products, less music.
We get people who say, "I don't have a record player."
Not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The foppi, which now has almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous stores - the speakers get Wild Beast's freshest synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at various records available for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so collecting disks isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on the computer or through some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I’m trying to look like I’m researching jeans shorts, I’m observing a group of teenage girls flocking around Polaroid cameras for a while before father and daughter consider buying Crosley’s turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorations, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyl".
But given that even the slightest attention these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho to get more, there’s not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one who spends the most on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate at least in Soho record stores, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They are certainly not spending their Thursday mornings strolling around Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old fake television presenter as he peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the busher has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and who is five meters long.
French Court Rejects Application to Dissolve Sale of Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected the Calais authorities' request to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary stores, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent an unpaid parallel economy and represent a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there are no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 temporary trades, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than just feeding people living in "extremely uncertain conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which is non-profit-making and provides 200 meals daily, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children’s café.
The letter sent to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 - a peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall much faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen second most in Finland in those EU countries that have the same wage level as in Finland.
In comparison countries, only the UK has seen food prices fall faster than in Finland.
The data are available from a post by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed down by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The major retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and price competition must continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
Anyone returning to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a rule that all Finnish schools operate in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education will start in sixth grade at the latest, and social studies will start with four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found: Ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
The Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the monitors, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have forcibly lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimetre amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are more than four metres old, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann to fire nearly 300 sellers
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant,” Stockmann said in a statement.
It does not reduce the number of department store sellers so that customer service is not affected.
In addition, about 80 support employees will be offered new jobs as vendors.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making department store sales profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
“Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second quarter net sales and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was EUR 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also showers of rain in the central parts of the country, but further south is the Poutai.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, it remains between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius.
Kenyan Athletics Team Shaked Up by Doping Scandal - A Strange Explanation for Coach's Rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete that Anzrah was trying to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya's national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home as he "did his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenya's Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino, in turn, thundered at the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year and is a prequel to Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team in turn claimed that Anzrah passed an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When he was confronted by anti-doping officials, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium is empty.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
Rio began a fight for athletic medals on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to showcase their skills to a confusingly empty audience.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheery crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics has already attracted attention before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medal-hops Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the crowd was full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and the crowd of 12,000 was only about 30% full.
The poor sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a lower number than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the Copacaba sands has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can cash in on the holder rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right to possess it in return for payment.
The holder receives a veto on his 187 square metre block, which means in practice that not every holder is required to have an approval if the purpose of use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for several segments.
Acquiring a right to govern is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control the company.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives precise location information from their block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The names of the holders of the rights are displayed on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the parcel data of the land area can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation acquisition only as a risk that the foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchasing or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
“In some cities there are twice as many thefts as in others,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Finnish Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the ranking.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much bikes are used in the city and how many bikes there are in general,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikkäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the top spot in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far away from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport,” says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day and around 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime of bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police survive.
A typical cleared-up bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in blood.
“There are also cases in connection with other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bikes may be found in the apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly for the act itself or during a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not been known to the police that the stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or offence.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underpriced price,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries her colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of her working day.
He has had five bikes, but not one has been stolen, the Moose says. "He has never been taken, a good monk has done that."
“Perhaps this doesn’t attract thieves so much, it doesn’t necessarily have hipster value either,” the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who had visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike swung the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
“I’m going to think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"I'm always hearing from my friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such snotty Jopos".
A bicycle was stolen from the apartment company’s courtyard a year ago.
Although the bike was unlocked, Valve was waiting for it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki tests peer-to-peer jurors familiar from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
A peer-to-peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a youngster.
The idea is for the peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may himself join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Affairs, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are guiding the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel but reflects on the event with approximately the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to keep going on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working will be offered to all those in need, not only to immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it to see.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be redirected instead of the Trump campaign to congressional elections.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record unpopularity threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American workers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We are builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the exit tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [the President], I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed cut to corporate taxes, Clinton has previously termed Trump a "loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making the products himself in America,” Clinton said.
These are the ratings for Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are shown in television viewing statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: the swimming on Tuesday evening was followed by 615,000 spectators from YLE’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships of a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships were well over a million.
So far, most of the Olympic sports have been interested in Sunday night cycling and gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and points out that the spectators will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns watch the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, too, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all that time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is weak now - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the start of the games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is only just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
In the beginning, the number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the Apple App Store during the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going to be about 200,000 downloads now.
"We'll only get the ratings later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as well for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics can be seen on Yle’s canals and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last that can only be followed by Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to the official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristenselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre depression on Ristiselkä, whose bottom depth was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There may well be unknown depths,” Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes of average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax reduction: Pensioner’s taxation continues to tighten
Pensioners’ taxation is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the grievances emerged in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage and salary earners.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
In our opinion, it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the election, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that eased taxation.
The issue heated opposition representatives in the parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (Kok.) about election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy on tax reductions presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don't add to people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s (center) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He said that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in handy because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own confidence in the future.
Tackling long-term unemployment in the threshing
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night during Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who stated that they were opposed to the law.
Thailand’s southernmost provinces are experiencing ethnic-national conflict over the Muslim population, Westphalen said.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on the holiday island of Phuket, a popular tourist destination in Finland, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A popular tourist attraction in Hua Hin has exploded, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang each.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is not known.
The leader of Thailand's ruling military junta, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Security Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had been intent on destroying tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the instructions of the Embassy on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
Last night’s attack in Hua Hin was reported.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the sight.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins Women's Quadruple
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustaf was third with a performance of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still seeking rack championships at the Rio Games in permand, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent over the past few years.
He won eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permannon championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved two team competition world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: ‘Isku has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think this will lead to anything more amazing, says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t even expelled the tourists, they probably won’t either.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9 a.m. local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the queen’s birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street shops were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
Many people on the beach had never heard of the attack.
By 3:30 p.m. during the Thai time on Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later that car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
By the time the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby fir.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear displacement
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking change in leadership in years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling management positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in skirmishes with other executives or has screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Mr Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high on the agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old Guards, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place is Putin’s changing his immediate circle to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw from Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Yarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of about 90 percent of the ISIS-important city of Manbij last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were kidnapped by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful,” says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authorities’ own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and on the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Communications Director tells the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time.
He injured his back thigh early in the season and was forced to miss the Jamaica Olympic qualifying.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
“I’ve practiced well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Porina Bolt highlights the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200 m early rounds with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and rivals' self-confidence despite the final celebration, with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career, measuring by clock.
World records of 9.58 at 100 metres and 19.19 at 200 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second under-record, but no one believes in creating it except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens' 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals if he has made the journey.
In Daegu 2011, the 100s World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt will turn 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the last goal line of his career.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and it's harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A sample of Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 metres runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't stop at all - historic gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200 metres in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mix ahead of Wang Shuni of China.
I’m just trying to have a little fun,” Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic swimming commentator, laughs during a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton on Monday is the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
Back steps are not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to thrill and maybe even startle, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be the lead.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus should be on athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I dress.
Can you believe that this has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me.
You know what?
It is a stir from nothing if it comes from the dress of the host.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
At the same time, police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism are members of the same group that police arrested in July.
Those arrested are believed to have ties to the Islamic State.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their Rio basketball tournament early match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after a controlled detonation of the package.
This is the third time in the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The public was able to enter after police had controlledly detonated the package.
The audience could not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hangar.
Police blew up the package and allowed the audience into the hangar only after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which started the games sleepyly.
With two losses, Spain beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the two previous games, Spain achieved silver.
Police conducted a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road bike finish point last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian lady beats Petäjä-Siren - Finn reflects on protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colourful day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren suffered hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck due to the crash, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
It was not worth it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation,” Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was left in 27th position after the crash.
Overall, London’s 2012 Olympic silver medallist is 8th.
With regard to the tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day for the race starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Surprising Things That Scientists Say Extend Age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person has no control over can bring them more years.
These include a tendency to mid-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to spend money, just getting a can of milk is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a number of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest findings of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "decreased risk of death," especially for neurological or heart-related diseases.
There are studies that suggest that moderate consumption - one to three doses per day - can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year-long project monitored over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
According to many studies, sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong your life.
Unfortunately, simply having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings more years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute flair.
A study by the University of Oxford found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than a regular ballerina.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years into his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity, on the other hand, is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour among people over 65 found that people who shop daily were less likely to be older than those who shop.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may prematurely cause death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping does not have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver crashes into truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Koskela, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskila, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained upright in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into a ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who was carrying a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sent candy to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salo’s K-Citymarket’s loose candy selection, because the post office had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candy from Salo’s K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load!
If there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The lawn mowing is offered by Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Even the media have been calling all the time, and the attention generated by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
He was able to get his own favorites into a bag of candy, even though a few boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti’s Corporate Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to do part delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It was first reported in the evening.
Teija Haltia was not angry with the sign, because she found all her favorite loose candy in the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund has released a picture of her change
The comedian-producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of her life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a couple of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her slimming contract already in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of her performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has collected a number of commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're amazing.
We’re on the same road, motivation!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let’s do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let’s do it now project.
At the time, he told the Evening Journal that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight, which was then 10 kilos away.
Over the course of three months, five pounds were dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations to police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money in its entirety goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa’s Koskenkylä.
The woman’s neighbors have said that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a conviction for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimated in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary, which corresponded to the induction’s share of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organizational decision on a ban on induction.
During the postal strike last November, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise temporary workers who break the strike.
It was first reported by the people.
Turkey to return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, wrote Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Finnish Journalists’ Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and freedom of expression to Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration, replaced by Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Persecution Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to a Kremlin statement, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will take over special tasks related to environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB's espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU to be banned, not seen in Premier League opening
The world record player will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed with England.
Manchester United's acquisition of Paul Pogba is on the sidelines due to suspension as ManU opens his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogballe was burdened with a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it will become a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, grandioseness is a virtue
Precise criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival’s status as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival performers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It’s a bit strange to think about events like this.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people last year by 5,000.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle controlled by huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over the past 13 years, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partly decorated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, this year’s venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "crees" things, such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all through content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand Tourist Paradise Bombs Hidden in Flower Pots, Tourists Flee in Horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started to leave bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra said.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a lot about the attacks.
If you can’t see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani, local time.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by troops will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to carry out combat tasks only after several months after taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the head of training of the Defence Forces, interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight, for example, of the 5.5-month conscripts serving in a war situation.
According to the head of training, first reservists belonging to the Standby Corps will be assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used in military operations already during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, the house was exposed to a serious moisture problem that caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple were forced to sell the apartment as demolishable in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the couple a total of 47 344 euros in court and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already been aware of some need to repair the dwelling when the sale was made.
According to the Court of Appeal, however, the construction errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than had been proposed.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm to the aspects mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and drawbacks ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little bit within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial flora in the building, which according to witnesses were caused by both rock rainwaters and capillary rising soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also enter indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast above the limit values, which enabled a health risk, was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also debated whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the apartment had been altered in violation of the permit.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could have assumed, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger-than-usual inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to Nazis - also Finnish in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland has recorded documents on microfilms about 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and license cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological tests were carried out on women to determine the matter.
The Finnish Race Agency investigated women’s backgrounds by studying church books, among other things.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Racial Agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-lovers", "sparing", and "good National Socialists" who knew well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidizing children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
In the sixth place of the Petty Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolls’ day in the Rio Olympics, but was the tail of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so hung over”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to bubble, and she is in a frenzy at the moment.
Mari Koppinen’s book about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Unladen, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total climb when he won the crown of the tango king at the Tango market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at his request, which Kassu Halonen adapted into a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
You wouldn’t guess from the recording of a song that became a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the result was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and perfection.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, as described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with her then partner and the case eventually ended up with the texts of "You Earn Gold", which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the lyrics of the song about the breakup were not true, but were written based on the news of 7 Days.
The newspaper reported that Jari and his ex-lover were separated due to excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said that it was complete nonsense and that it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters supported the resignation and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although polls of voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of a recent election campaign by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into the junkyard in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economical Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists explain the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the impression that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly upset by the BBC's fairness, which gave as much room as the overwhelming majority of economists representing only a couple of percent of the economy, pro-EU withdrawal.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in saying what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capital combinations were like about the consequences of the resignation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not feel they have common interests.
The academics of big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overwhelming victory argument was on immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How many jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond and, if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, or the victory of the camp in favour of leaving the EU, in case the result was to be left.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets,” Vanhanen said of Aberdeen’s only open-ended daily-listed real estate fund.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was valued at £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
That was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds Closed Trades
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
Together, they raided the situation and put the issue in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good due to the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close down trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be withdrawn in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks now, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in Aberdeen's Continental European funds.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closing of real estate fund trades received an unreasonably high level of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of British real estate.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its funds closed until 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved down, but the situation does not look "bizarre" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors,” Vanhanen points out.
The pound/dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit has opened up the real estate market in London.
At two o’clock in the morning, things didn’t look too good.
But at four o’clock when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word, isn't it?
I realized that this is now going to Plan B,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in spite of the early hours of the morning.
TV screens normally set to silent in the office were ringing the news, and normally loud people were completely silenced when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to report his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Starts Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in the UK, and in particular in London.
Up to 20% minuses were anticipated for office space in London in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the break-up will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First developments in the real estate market in London have already been reported.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
London City’s office buildings were down 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the downfall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
This is not an accurate comparison, as it is now a domestic crisis in the UK.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
The repair could have happened anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a surprise to him - one could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, property prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons:
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership category that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new properties.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used considerably less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, decentralize
Prices increased in London last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not have the courage to judge the future, but says that there is hardly any rise.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several stores up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the pits can be overcome by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, it is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the retail group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
So far, when information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start collecting it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group comes after Kesko here, because the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information,” Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to S Group’s registration change.
Kesko categorizes its regular customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own customer loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product group information, we stay at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day as well as the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K Group or S Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be renewed in the future, but the Local Store will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially experiment
So far, SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address data, the basic data have also included occupation, education, type of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of the children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase contains the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
Anyone interested can check their saved data on S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador’s puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila with playing with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of gunpowder-scented shells.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be deployed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused Customs to take measures, and after the attacks controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector General at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs’ duties are postal items passing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapon parts, ammunition and explosives, and their precursors, among purchases, passenger plane luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and the Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t go home without her, she laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from one-time.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila immediately returns the guard that looks like a soft toy from the "disengage" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the following October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog wearing work vests, Suntio points out.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours last only ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a fierce competition at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal, people get a day off
Fiji's Olympic gold medal in rugby, with a population of less than one million, is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's public broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off will be the day after the team’s return home.
Heroes are also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering,” Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times journalist, told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos and 145 kilos.
His total was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilos, as did the other.
On the third attempt, the weights increased, accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemin Palloseura, playing in the men's football league, has signed a contract with Estonian forward Albert Prosa to the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player for our team, who has powers and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over 10 players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is expected to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Modern Family star: teen star’s shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become the friendly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family comedy series, reprises his flair for his boisterous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior significantly more courageously.
The star has been posing in photos posted on social media with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you can’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At the time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He’s learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has outraged some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard,” a woman on Winter’s Instagram said.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, exudes a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the Northern Lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in the press release.
The main destinations of Northern Lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump card for our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for Lapland’s winter Northern Lights trips, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the northern lights season begins in early autumn and continues long into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a two-fold fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by, among other things, online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to have clearer unique sights in Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lindi.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have increased clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting in terms of the target group of Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fid's master class leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to Fiji's final challenge in Thursday night's finals when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in handling, chewing, dodging, supporting, running lines and sheer force in winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby starting tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semi-finals earlier that day may have plagued them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
The UK may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but it's a startling development.
Fidi started off excellently, countering UK tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running toward moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the end zone.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was just a slow-motion for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through Britain's loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the break, the score was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's exactly what it is.
Great Britain made wholesale changes in the break that blocked Fidi's dam...a total of four minutes, which compared to the first half was good until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pass game.
Dan Norton caught a goal for Great Britain when he scored a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi’s cheerful approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute paint had a frosting on Fidi's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Great Britain beat South Africa in the tight semi-final, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goal posts in the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15-side rugby team, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, to 220 rough kicks toward history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams was present the whole time as the two entered their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's pairing - the first women in British sports history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th performance undefeated, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with swan grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind each rowing gold is a group of helpful hands that gradually advance the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as relevant as a coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the operation.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start their treatment in early 2014 outside the season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that term can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, Williams, who had had a nervous morning, was the first person in the couple’s thoughts, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment for the Afghan deployment, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The last three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he deserves a big thank you, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or trainer.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The pair set a rough rhythm that their rivals could not reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen shouted, “Stay in the process, stay in the process.”
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time did not try to do anything special.
We weren’t looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for good rowing and winning the race, and that’s what we did.
A couple wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be attending a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After about six months in London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to change government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks have already called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now scheduled for October 29.
Analysts say it’s hard to predict how much the nation’s rage last spring will affect the election results in the autumn.
In June, the presidential election was marked by a clear criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran for president from outside politics, was elected as president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest rumors.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“The commander-in-chief of the army should never let anyone who can sink that low,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-popular burkini bathing suits on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that exuberantly express religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two ISIS-linked men attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Pyykösjärvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been detected at Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action Board took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region area.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria from all bathing areas were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal levels in the Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
Blue-algae opacity observed at Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-algae blooms, creating a blue-green algae mass on the water surface as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, this is also reported separately on the information board of the bathing area.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside Finland
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for a generational change of a forest holding.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry’s aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of creating such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is a good one, says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticism in the tax reform proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Finance starts from the premise that by reducing the pure capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of capital income from forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out,” Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says, the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been too high for me.
As such, 82% of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the scope of the reduction.
The model would affect about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the boundary guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken for decades in forest policy.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hail surprises motorists in Himanga, two cars fall into ditch and collide with each other
On Friday morning, there was a special accident in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue services, two consecutive times the car fell into a ditch, after which the one in the back collided with the one driving ahead.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the fireman on duty is suspected to have been derailed due to strong hail.
There were two people in the car behind him, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga towards Kalajoki for a few kilometres.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku may help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medication may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos' family home killing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder conviction for another perpetrator
Muhos's family home killing is continuing at the court for both convicted persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for a family home killing in Muhos.
The other was given 8 years for 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The other is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
Convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as an unauthorised young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were fully understood at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the couch of the living room from behind.
The director had let go of the hold and led the young man into his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled by the lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental examination, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world and only breeds at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until the age of 156.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of mussel is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists were able to determine the age by radiocarbon dating.
Nuclear testing in the 1950s resulted in radioactive residues in some sharks.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the shark.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state's tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's proposed change to the corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by tax relief for the benefit of the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
That would be a huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after Trump's proposed reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the economy and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided upon in haste must be reformed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of America’s problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
China would be subject to a 45 per cent penalty tax and Mexico 35 per cent.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America Doesn't Need to Change the World:
American cars will drive the streets, American airplanes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his custom, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists — including those close to Republicans — see Trump’s program as driving the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is tumultuous, but an actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous directorial work Journey Lovers (2013) was a fun and rosci-like satirical comedy, the one I live in (2011).
Levelwise, Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She begins before the birth of her daughter, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, is the second female lead in the TV-acquainted series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that it’s quite gently and literally a one-time sweep.
Almodóvar films are often characterised by such egregiousness, all the way to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is an evenly played, restrained, place-to-place film with good music and a rather melancholy film with elements of its elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation that is typical of a Spanish director is still there, and in such a way that it begins to sting in the eye more as a pure matter of form than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true of costumes: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same is true of spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point, i.e. the layouts of the scene in question, is not particularly improved from this.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian writer Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flatly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably more robust than the drama, that much big stuff - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premiere is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made in a row.
There will be no further cuts.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided on will suffice.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spending limits discussion in the spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The training cuts continue.
The town halls haunt
Why do ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts will be made to them?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallupit, however, says that the party in government expects the Finns Party to lose a rucksack, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, of which the price of influencing the right-wing government will be realised for most of them next spring.
The life span of three parties of roughly the same size depends on the courage of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermenting state have also surfaced.
The new “no cuts” rhetoric, firstly, obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, attempts to soften the attack that awaits Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set a target of indebtedness being reversed during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will include EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not stop or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This will mean even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what comes next will be accepted.
These measures do not allow debt to be eliminated.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not stop the indebtedness, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget information meeting prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy pursued at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
The question is, do you want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities?
Three out of four feel that organising child day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also takes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, on the other hand, is most clearly sought for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with mental disabilities.
None of the tasks of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A young drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol at Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man drove the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Still after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving license that allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, for example, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
The truck in the truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
Rescue services lifted an injured driver out of a fallen truck through a door left above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil leaked into the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahtinkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman about 6 inches tall, slender, and well-positioned with white hair that extends under the chin.
Observations and tips on missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre on the hotline 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge that brought down the tents of the Parafest festival caused massive damage.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the market place at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The surge flow is generated in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools down and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surge currents will occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surge currents is difficult to predict.
The surge struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the Parafest venue, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air pollution obsolescences Londoners
Research has shown that Londoners age faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzed London’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of a rural peer.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, with nearly 9,500 Londoners dying each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel by commuting close to congested streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed, pushed the man in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When she got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not run any further, as it collided with the rocks in front of it.
Riento with new powers for the coming season
League-Riento, playing in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series in October from better starting points than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
A common note can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, a midfielder from the foreign trio, starts his second season in Rieno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared on the Rwanda national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimetres.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to join the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth race is now taking place in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in the North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was in the process of forming the National Floorball Team.
I was interested, and here I am, 48,” he said.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I arrived in Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at SM level as floorball.
The game was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship 1991-92 with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's championship, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The last season of SM is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Brno EFT tournament in the Czech Republic on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has previously played six men’s national games in Helsinki, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the leg trouble and is a member of the national team's regular fleet with experience of 117 international games.
Mika Kohonen was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December's World Cup.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volleyball’s Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the Finnish Championship Finals tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of each series ranking.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been one of the top Finnish beach volleyball champions for several years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to watch this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s spark in the sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
I have very good memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old with Elimäki YMCA E-girls.
At the top is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that rotate around the ankles, as well as huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment in which to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the activities - our teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice in junior times to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
Bites have been played on the beach of Curved Pond since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to see the Junior Championships myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu and Anniina Parkkinen play together in the Finnish Championship Finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey we are still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in civil work are expected.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The surge brought down three tents at the Parafest festival for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to the hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, an on-call fire officer interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli becomes a farmer
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers based on his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking in debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into hand from agriculture.
Ever since I was a kid, this has been my thing.
I’ve always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you start something, you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage, and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the newspaper’s website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared with December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.2%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect rated as Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million daily users to modify reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial features-wrinking tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for advertising a blackface mask or favoring bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised for some users this week a lens that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and plump cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people — a “yellowface,” or yellowface.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: Lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others banned the anime comparison fiercely.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photographs were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it's tricky to argue against a comparison with side by side gross Asian caricature and filter effects".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeanor.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that goes beyond these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents can mean they’re even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, "it's a lot harder for these guys to be unobtrusive than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his article for Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believes that race-related disputes reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and concluded his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they would feel safe or could speak up."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to respond to.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of its staff, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a Congressional panel said officials from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces War Area modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what events on the ground justified.
The interim report report of the working group set up by the Republican chairman of the House Defense Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at headquarters who said that superiors tampered with their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces War Domain in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. Armed Forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than was justified by facts on the ground. They were consistently more positive than analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable — our fighters in the war suffer when poor analysis is presented to high-ranking decision-makers," spokeswoman Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems with HQ descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that high-ranking administration officials in the Obama administration have ordered reports to be tampered with, it does describe analysts feeling as if Centcom leaders were putting pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the HQ's press releases, statements, and testimonies to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major offensive to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders at the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces War Area manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters in order to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence information about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, follows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense Superintendent has launched an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessary isolated process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," spokesman Adam B. Schiff, the committee's lead Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the release of intelligence outputs", worsened the mood among analysts and "did not give enough room for divergent perspectives".
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House had attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into "a pre-set or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has opened an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions than just the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on HQ to provide honest estimates of military action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
A review of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy more than a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what the consequences of the 2003 attack would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic State intelligence.
According to officials last year, Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic state-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters, however.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at headquarters.
The United States wins for the fourth consecutive time in women's field hockey, organizing a showdown with Britain
The day after scoring three goals as the team beat Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But here's what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 position in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who will finish first and who will finish second in their group of six teams.
The first-placer avoids a strong Holland, the leader of the second group, a little longer as the quarter finals begin.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have raised a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they missed the London Olympics last of 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) to join the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest ever player.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for the final player list.
In 2012, nothing went well for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn’t have the same pace of work in London as we do today.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half scoring with a backhand close to goal.
India had come into the game with a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then rotated to the center and pulled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal halfway through the fourth period.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper of the tournament for Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace amidst the Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, raging message of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation next to you in a café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-timer and future heartbreaker with his smile pits, could well be one of the names known to everyone to be presented for best quality time and supported by sponsorship deals and good-natured TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold in a trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by all: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there is so little attention to its presence in the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually award men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals.
However, the trampoline is associated with a certain underdog charm, partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I’m not an expert, I’m just a flightless fan.
The sport has possibilities for amusement, as noted by the vibration of endless bounces in cartoon films, but it also has the grace of gymnastics and swimming, the two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jump up to nearly 30 feet in a giant trampoline, and must perform rotating sequences of moves (turns, folds, and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
Rio has 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common course of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those wishing for the medal must go further, faster, up and over in their quest for gold - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another scoffing line: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical — and it can even cause the viewer to tears.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline provides a moment of rest from this.
The trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new rise, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no furious rush toward the end, no leaps into the distance, just a dreamy, fluid interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen space as can be reached in the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the finals will take place on Friday afternoon with the start of the broadcast at 1 pm (ET), the men's competitions will also come on Saturday at 1 pm.
NBC airs the finals as part of its afternoon repertoire starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not to be noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes to stare at and objectify (as suggested by male gymnasts in the United States some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
‘Generation Protests’ in Ethiopia, a Long-Term Ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a radical political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
The videos, which are believed to be from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while they were forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and Western countries value its stability.
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved immensely, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly talked about government repression, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are demonstrating.
One generation is protesting.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition governing land use to choke grip.
After the much-criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition, and now holds all the seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the Eritrean border are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil under the surface, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through network proxy servers that hide their location.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharics, who came from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by taking advantage of Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and who live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amharic and Oromo areas.
Many Amharics and Oromos think that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the Tigre people. The people cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"Current government doesn't have that kind of basic instinct," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the Tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005 was when thousands demonstrated elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been first fluttered by the government and then robbed.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters died, albeit fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuting train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the country’s internal escalation of contempt for the Ethiopian government.
And now it's starting to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and anti-Tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighbouring Somalia, although it recently said it had shut down this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable ally to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing."
Donald Trump Explains Obama-Based ISIS Allegation as 'Sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy that had taken hold of his most recent campaign on Friday by claiming he was not serious when he insisted numerous times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic state's terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in a tricky position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation made at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump argued the same with increasing enthusiasm in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took him to hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign amidst declining polls into the economy.
Trump and Clinton were fighting over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump returned to the subject.
Fleeing to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm in the past.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "truly I am sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' in one direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is crafty about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of relaxing his speeches for a large voter audience, Trump has been more sappy in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published Friday showed that Trump is dragging behind Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tries to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misconstruing his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny during the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on the news media that grinds at his every word and is biased against him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to get a hold of him, saying "They won't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was unfit for president.
Formerly closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street on Bedford Avenue became too expensive for it.
The store that replaced the Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
It was lamented by locals as the latest loss in a city to be renovated to middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and the Chelsea Hotel is crushed and the Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it’s also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance her in a new location, she said she was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same bagels supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought in some new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and overlays include capers and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly attended the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the cafe.
He says that after the Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed the coffee and culture of the Verb," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai drink, one of the new additions, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work, and he always placed the same order.
"Every day at fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he does not hold a grudge against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to prepare a special soap for Verb using cold-extracted coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up soon at some point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said that he felt as if he had come home as he walked inside and ordered a coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods such as foie gras pastry, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, the A Square Meal, published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving with turkey, potato puree and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found it appropriate to discuss eating the Depression.
"The mournings were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanutloaf, liverloaf, beanloaf.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make up your dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have felt like lead heavy in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, American tables, especially in the countryside, were like an eating-as-much-as-you-you-take-out table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. The A Square Meal chronicles the ways a nation survived the fact that suddenly it was no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes such as crumbs and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was "a great way to use food leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the center of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also doing research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
Peanut butter is by no means suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetaries" and meet the challenge of converting lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'Let Me Eat Cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in the almost gold-plated dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was awesome out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only one of Washington's drearyest, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the depressed eating habits were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, how she was unable to throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a spectacular name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed their spoons in a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe said once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgetist, he told his wife, "slightly chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead Reimbursement of Lawyer Costs in Hepatitis C Patent Fight Against Merck
A U.S. engagement judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive attorney’s fees in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in fees for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, following the discovery by a U.S. judge of Merck’s abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In Thursday’s verdict, Beth Labson Freeman, a judge of the U.S. Order of Engagement, said that Gilead is entitled to exemption from the compensation it received in opposition to the suit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work on the basis of the active substance sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed troops say they have taken over Manbij, completely ruled by ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij, located entirely near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing-lipant prisoners held captive by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwish SDF's ally force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2 percent of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse's income that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker fees, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book, which reported on his career at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retracts his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to the custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, although the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit as a reason for refusing to disclose their tax returns.
"It's your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were ready.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business activities, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has addressed the problem by releasing an online video Friday that brought out prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the audience.
Politico has announced that Trump has paid no or very little taxes in the two 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has endorsed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he is also undergoing an IRS audit, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, had an actual federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their primary investment target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers to enhance elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements — they throw animals with condoms filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the idea was coined several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation in collaboration with the U.S. Nature Conservancy has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have seen a change in attitudes in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include pointing a penetrating elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it does not stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted around so that only the fuse is visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts banging and bursts chili powder dust into the air.
A single scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the area code for Israel. The employee says this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary film about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ release.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country code list provided by the Israeli hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker raised the issue at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there "shocked him".
The hotel's recipeist said that it was "a deliberate decision by the Kempinski hotel management".
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code," the employee reportedly said, according to Lanzmann.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the incident a "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But the shame is even greater that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "give in" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another publication, noting that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "inattention" as well as "sorrying" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order never made to include Israel in the speed dial list," Kempinski's spokesman reportedly said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when students gathered to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement officers attempted to disperse a group of students, leading to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
According to proposals by Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, Governor of Sao Paolo State, little less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be resettled to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration occurred just days after the protesters set out as a single force to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted on his impeachment.
RT Business: Russia-Iran trade suddenly increases by 71%
Since the lifting of the sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, said.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown great interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth in trade was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner plunged into the finish line as the British caught cycling gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland was honored at the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the UK team trio defended their title from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in a role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man when he ran to the finish line, catching the victory from the favorite New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly finishing sixth at the March World Track Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was replacing special envoy Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held up by British coaches in view of the potential of the Scots that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, and included driving Hindes in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed up on his position as an expert on the BBC, and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment, and British rivals have not complained.
This time there was no such problem with winning.
Hindes said, "It felt like being in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of a total of ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will have a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals at one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — the total number of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next to compete in a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoyed this one.
Team competition is always the best.
You win it with your friends.
Winning alone is, to be honest, lonely.”
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest in timetime in a four-person, four-mile team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the race, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the time slots when officials called him for a length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the centre of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
Having presented a truly exceptional and perfect mastery in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, the least of which has not been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and temptation, as well as the end of the racing career of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first-night races at the cycling stadium, it seems that the UK’s now legendary reputation could once again hold true at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's meltdown is questionable due to power contract cuts
The future of the Victorian aluminium smelter in Portland, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when a power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant's owners is about to terminate a distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year not to extend the subsidies required to operate the plant.
The 20-year period expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been caused by the price of the plant's production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said it is also waiting for the three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by the Alcoa-Alumina Group, and Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the unmelted physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively end in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects the contracts to yield results for fiscal year 2017," the electricity company said.
All potential impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong outlook for the wholesale electricity price futures market.
The AGL said it has already "preliminarily" reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep smelting in operation or to secure unmelted electricity supply".
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was due to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomas plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If both plants leave the market, this will be a significant decrease in demand for the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, that would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and modeled for Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just Kardashian style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the cliché plot pattern of almost every children's television series "birthday episode" (Seacrest recites the lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning cartoon bunny), but Kris had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved into the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue slot.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the highest-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus was advertising content).
The unveiling of its cover star is so intensely awaited that for the past two years, photos of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebs acting as models" on the cover than "models being celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of his generation, hit the first category, he would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren’t the relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are justifiably talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be tedious.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But turning around in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's modeling for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
He and all his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality TV star.
Every year 160 000 people are turned away by Community legal centres
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are turned away from the Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services, already stretched to the Community's limits, are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres calculation report, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, meaning that every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippled debts, separated families, unfairly dismissed workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while they were driving a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte by former software intern Vincent Bordin of the state campaign.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that "it was not going to happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and stuck a barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip.
"The guns do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the suit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of the Second Amendment" - which usually includes gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to elect judges.
The Trump campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and causing emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond to the request immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotte reported Phillip had recently left the campaign.
A call request from his consulting firm Innovative Consulting Services was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the belly, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
As before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be ashamed in front of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question it is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180,000 new jobs and economic growth of £211 billion, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget: from the T5, voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, built between the world’s two busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is one too.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse play to block ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the program that blocks ads are "cat and mouse play," said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that said users could update the program's filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code is being changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says that it has circumvented a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of round-the-clock battle between the open-source ad blocker community and its go-rounders has been going on since the ad blocker was invented", and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much grief ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is after the ad blockers on the pages used on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for social networks or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it was daily using its “ad preference” tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we’ve focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorway because of a suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway in the early hours of Thursday in an incident that was apparently a suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and settled in the dark lying on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, calling on them and all eyewitnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this," lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That remains to be decided by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, two similar cases suggest that drivers are not held liable.
In both cases — both of which had a person walking on a dark highway — it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to face a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of manslaughter for negligence after he hit and killed a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court said.
The court found that a police officer who was responding to an emergency call was driving in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to estimates from NASA's new climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out if Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, could have ever had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of having a 30% fainter sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side of the day to the sun for almost two months at a time," said Anthony Del Genio, a researcher at GISS.
This warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although probably habitable at some time, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with its deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach job
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from the positions of Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey affairs, saying the reason was the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president and head coach of hockey at the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and vice-president of ice hockey must be fully aligned with that of the organisation.
He must also have the ability to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the League in his first season of the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a central division win, but Minnesota downed Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to go on in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and a 4 draw, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference's wild card playoff spot.
Roy, a goaltender selected for the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks and postpone strike
North Sea oil workers' labor battles over pay will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service company Wood Group have been sporadic on North Sea drilling platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ fees by approximately 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s commission reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary leeway to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, in turn, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's largest labor disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
New data will help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now at the top level.
At their peak rotational speed, these maturing stars are pouring out large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by monitoring the appearance of recognizable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of stellar rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the larger of whom make pirouettes slower than the smaller.
"In the 'ballet' of the pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory to estimate the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because, and why, stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
