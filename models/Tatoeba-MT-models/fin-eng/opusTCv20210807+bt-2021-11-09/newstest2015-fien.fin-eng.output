The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The City Council unanimously approved the deal on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal annexation, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent municipality.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The next municipal elections will be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.
Prime Ministers of Japan and India to meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, will meet his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit after an election victory in May.
The purpose of Modi’s five-day visit to Japan is to strengthen economic relations with the world’s third largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in a substantial political dialogue with the eastern part of its country, Putin said.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces are shooting at civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get a chance to shoot at residents in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmivarjaamo.
I was surprised that the group arrived early in the evening.
There were visitors in two days as expected, promoter Tom Kangas says.
Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be a hip-hop festival, so there’s no pop,” Kangas says.
A law will come into force on Tuesday that restricts the acquisition of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply to the National Police Board for permission to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as so-called precursors for explosives.
These substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as mixtures containing them if the specified concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present in cleaning and detergents, for example, but the concentrations in them do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitroethane is used in acceleration driving, for example.
However, source materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Nairn and Pitlochry
The accused of the rapes in two hotels is facing trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a court in Glasgow.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's hotel in the province of Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman while she is "in an unconscious state, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision on her own".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands, Nairn, on May 4, 2014.
According to Judge Lady Rae's ruling, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Superior Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Evening-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, reinforced with Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest at Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City times.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and pitched only half of his sixteen passes to his own team.
In the future, players who have already been favored by Pool fans expect better.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a team star, instead of Balotelli, sparkled the tip of the midfield diamond, Raheem Sterling, who poked a 3-0 win past an important opening goal by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
An Englishman 20 cm shorter than a Balotelli is between an opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who is racing on the lawn at its best at a speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves great praise for Sterling’s development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a player from Wembley in north-west London into a more comprehensive player than a side runner.
Susanna Mälkki selected as Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of Finland for over a hundred years, for example by performing a large amount of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to working with you in the future," he said.
Administrations of employees' organisations meet in pension negotiations - Domestic country - Regions - News - Karjalainen
We are looking for a new impetus for pension negotiations today from the labour market organisations’ own gatherings.
In the morning, the administrations of the employees’ organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation situation.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Labour market organisations have struggled, among other things, to tie the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created this week.
Pliers.
Rovaniemi-based women's volleyball league team Woman Volley tripped over league lifter Vampula's Athletes Pihtiputa in the practice tournament finals on Sunday.
The Vampula twisted into five one-stretched match 3-2 wins.
In the final round, WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and the pass game the Vampula was a bit better, WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoVo's six was ragged in that the 190-centimeter American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the sidelines.
The center was played by Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and formed WoVo's most fiery combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the Vampula was a skilled Russian Passer and Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, who WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna’s HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "trade" at 6 p.m. in the official practice game.
We will meet again on Sunday at the sports school.
Lidl forges wild figures in Finland
The turnover of the company’s stores in Finland increased by almost 25 per cent during the financial year ending in February to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes in Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths are more frequent in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video to pay tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers looked at medical records of more than 1,100 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Australia in 2005, and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirmed that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Medicines May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers reviewed women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous illnesses, and socio-economic status also contributed to the chance of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the likelihood of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside the cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming increasingly common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients who are treated far away from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor, regardless of their geographic location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family mother in Gold Coast, Elisha Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its snowmobile parking in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the Hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the town plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be made publicly available at the service point Osvieva.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
The city wants to enable tourism-related snowmobiling activities to continue in the area.
It is planned to establish a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
There are also refuelling points for a certain part of the area.
Service traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and changing plans have caused even loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring blocks of flats have been annoyed by both the sound and the concern about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been studied, and the studies have not revealed any observations that go beyond the guidelines.
Even the new equipment is lower than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point was moved further away, the hotel’s safari clients would have to transport the safaris to the departure points by buses, which would be approximately 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also large enough for sleds, better than the places presented as replacement starting points, such as the eastern side of the boat platform on the bridges of the river Ounasjoki.
The Friendship Park is good because of its location, because in the future the activities may expand to the Ounaspaviljonki area, for example.
The consolidation of parking activities is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and operationally advantageous places.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre’s partial master plan, which has not yet gained legal force.
The decline in owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under the age of 35, may lead to a decline in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales for their age. The Financial Times reported a study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) of the UK Horticultural Trades Association (HTA).
According to a report by the Financial Times, renters spend only 55% of the money spent on gardening by homeowners.
The study had also revealed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments without gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is reduced as the front yard is more and more often paved as a parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the gardening sector, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion per year.
In the London metropolitan area, home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest spending per household on horticultural products in the country.
However, according to HTA and the British Gardening Association (RHS), increasing rental of apartments or decreasing the size of a garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS' leading garden advisor Guy Barter says that "for example, plants grown in mobile growing vessels are particularly popular among apartment renters because such growing vessels can be included in the move if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a boom in horticultural resale due to the increase in housing ownership and wealth from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, since the weather in March and April last year has been worse.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over espionage report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to provide an account of the report on US and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. embassy and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the US National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy site for US and UK intelligence services.
Turkish news agencies say Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report of the German main intelligence agency's espionage against Ankara caused a more angrier reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
The Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several successful films, has been attached to a female lead role in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights into the morning, which starts filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 film The Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film The Butterfly in the Glass Dome.
2 Nights to Morning is a movie by Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The whistleblowers presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Calvià police chief on Mallorca holiday island has been arrested following allegations of corruption by shop owners and bar owners in the Magaluf area, known for its damp celebration.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several shop owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him, with most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to Mallorca Diario, an online daily newspaper, witnesses of the incident provided evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges, and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC reported that nightclub owners were angered by the bias of the authorities, which made their business significantly more difficult.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," one shop owner told the court.
You're not destroying our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer having oral sex with 24 men during a pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was ordered to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly fined €55,000.
Especially among young British tourists, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and tension in rocket-bombed communities in southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the south town of Ashdod, at the Pashosh kindergarten, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routine.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, felt that coming back to school after a long time would feel "a little strange".
"We've had some tough times at times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's ceasefire began, thousands of residents of communities in the Saad border region had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza Front are skeptical about the return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
For the time being, the children of these families have been placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study diligently and promised that "the education and safety of children will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations in Egypt is expected to begin later this month.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, saying that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no solid evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza were damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still under cover and fighting continued, school officials moved the start of school the week before.
"I hope the school opens soon and we can get back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used meter, house prices have risen most in seven years during the winter months in Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose in June, July and August by a total of 4.2 per cent, which is more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that house prices rose by 16.1 percent in Sydney and 11.7 percent in Melbourne the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by just 1.4% per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale over the coming months, a real test for the housing market.
"Given the rise in sales of apartments to be auctioned, the generally brisk pace of sales and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has brought record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has exhibited pop classics from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
On Monday, Mänttä Art Week reported that it had set a visitor record when 14,500 interested people had visited the event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been slapping through doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will be close to 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue well through the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four cases of theft in Kajaani in the last four days.
On Sunday night, a commercial property in Pohjolankatu was broken into by breaking a window.
The suspect had taken a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel was stolen from a truck.
Between Sunday and Monday, a boat with its outboard engines had been taken from Petäisenniska marina.
The rowing boat was Kalapalta-branded light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside it read "OVA" on the nose.
A couple of suspects have already been caught.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into.
A police dog got a print and a 20-year-old Paltamo man was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, police arrested another man in Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine found guilty of murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than 10 grams of amphetamines resulted in a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to an apartment with his common-law partner and another man and shot the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old woman from Kajaani, who he suspected was a drug exporter, with a shotgun.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of police when a police patrol stopped a car where the party was burning clothes used for blood work.
In addition to burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a judgment later in the case.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August repeats itself on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the July and August heats, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature in the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to seven children from an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, based in part on a fictional conversation with his father and developed based on a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap in an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm watching cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer bottle or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus gained an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
Melthouses are now a little lighter, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinth-like depths, with flames, smoke and soot bursting, reminiscent of hell.
Dad used to take a bath and just lie down in the tub, and slowly he began singing to himself as he washed the dirt from the smelter away from himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity his parents offered.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother got sick a little before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Dawn French, and through her own child, she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Will you stop hugging me?
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why can't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to take a turn.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce my symptoms.
It's very difficult.
and boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
Next up were the Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Fences").
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old as a factory worker.
A DJ spotted him on stage making impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. "For quite a while I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to make jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living stardom and being on television, it was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which individuals appeared in black make-up, so Henry ended up being a comedian on the program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and disapproving, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show" was at the same time a "grossy parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the 1980s, both making jokes and admiring black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
The following decade Henry spent on commercials, documentaries, TV series, and film parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len — now it seems like you're just pedaling in your place or you're going on the sidings".
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears tights and has money.
That’s why Shakespeare made me afraid.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, “Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Dating words and understanding why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's final speech for the documentary and he had been sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
In the end, the play was a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that was not quite the case.
Shortly after, Henry played the lead role in the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly, I was acting at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me, 'You'll have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the presentation would be resumed as soon as the problem was corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and part of me sighed a sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the show, stay in your role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines to play "Fences" was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes people more resilient.
This play, too, was well received, so it was as if a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
This is what Henry says in a beautiful voice, of course.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still essentially a comedian: little babies of humor constantly interrupt our conversation as he changes from one impersonation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you constantly crave it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it no longer excites me in the same way as before.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I’ll ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
The story is constantly being told, and I enjoy doing it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares register of officials to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive pay, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands are still being paid after they leave their civil service duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on “ghost workers” salaries and other financial abuses per month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after the person has died or left his official post, Wanyama Chebusiri of the BBC reported from the capital, Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the next few weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as this will determine how many people actually perform their duties. In addition, it will clear payrolls at both levels of the government. This will solve the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official in the cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s result for the 2015 financial year may remain in deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the City adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is expected to be around 9.4 million.
Possible ways of improving efficiency included compromising the scope and level of services, as well as purchasing services, selling property and grants, and increasing tax and payment revenue.
Of the EUR 10 million qualifying target for investments, EUR 8.5 million is in size.
There is no relief for local communities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenue, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government is unanimous on the need to make savings.
The ship must be turned to the strategic goal, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted proposals for preparation by the Management Team.
The City Board’s proposals form the basis for the budget preparation at the Council’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal will proceed through the board hearing to the City Board and City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources reported.
Police did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, among those arrested were 14 high-ranking police officers.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing an extensive criminal gang and tracking phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that time) said the police actions were part of a planned action by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first of September ceremonies were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the leading teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsenyuk's daughter goes, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations on the first day of school traditionally include embroidered shirts for children, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the abusive tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry's verified Twitter account sent a defamatory picture of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of hearing allegations of abuse of power on Sunday night.
The tweet was later removed, and was followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," a later release said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a libelous cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury gathering in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet headlined: "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much as allowed at the perm... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger".
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio who was assigned to the position by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the allegations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the relevant judge to dismiss the allegations and said that the law under which the longest-serving governor of Texas is charged is unclear, mirrored against the constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the state's public inviolability unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning follow-up team to file a formal complaint on the matter.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is regularly updated — and sometimes famously.
After reaching fifth place in the Iowa election convention during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the draw by posting a picture of himself jogging on the lake on Twitter with the text "Here we go, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says housing market is "normal" again
One of London's most important developers has warned that the south-east English housing market has "returned" to normal activity levels.
London’s capital has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases while fear of widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of high-end developer Berkeley, said Monday that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and number of trades have returned to normal since the peak of 2013" and added that this has allowed for a "stable operating environment".
The housing market in London went well during the recession as foreign investors sought hordes to the capital.
According to land register data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average selling price of Berkeley's private, affordable, and student buildings rose by about one-fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some have also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manor tax" ahead of the May general election.
Foxtons, a London real estate agent, warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending orders, would lead to lower levels of market growth in terms of both real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Hamptons International, a real estate broker, has lowered its 2015 forecast of London real estate prices by 3%, as the index measuring homeowners’ opinion on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of deals made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter from a year ago, according to WA Ellis, a real estate agent.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a boon to Berkeley, which increased revenue from properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, right kind of product in the best locations has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained brisk".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the peak before the financial crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 percent year-on-year to £380 million and turnover increased by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's year's earnings match current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before tax for the full year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange at a steady price of £23.96.
Hacker leaks nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to be in possession of images of 100 other stars leaked nude images of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A representative of the Hunger Games star confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker for "insolent invasion of privacy".
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The photos, originally published on the 4chan photo release page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. There are allegedly dozens of other female stars on the list of 100 other stars targeted by the hack, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“For those of you who are looking at photos taken years ago by me and my husband in the privacy of our home: I hope you’re feeling good,” Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series Victoria Justice denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude pictures of me are FALSE, don't you understand".
Let me put an end to this at the beginning.
BuzzFeedin announced late on Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of images of the star.
Only we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, it best described what happened, gradually they separated like a cardboard box left outside in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that he was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little thorny.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes was in the early stages of a relationship that had been promising, however; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it could perhaps have brought even some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and she was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from the village of the north, which was even harsher and further away from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt, who had inherited a house situated in a damp but paradisaic valley, and the valley was conveniently called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds growing in the garden, resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a fairy tale of children, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Award in 2014.
The nominations will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailin on a broken terrace chair amidst a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news as Ailin's christened, sun-tanned feet brought to mind a song that had been sung by a long-forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to in the cottage blinds below.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They weren’t banned — nothing was actually banned — they just weren’t played anymore.
They wanted to be forgotten, as did the word forget.
Public opinion produced what laws and bans had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks, and romances, in music they preferred the ballads.
Enchanted by the day, Kevern began to key the fictitious piano and sing a serenade to Ailinn's big feet in an insolently comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let go of a word that starts with a "J" and you didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t actually banned, it wasn’t just played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one “if.”
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit shown through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts, gratefully — grateful, that they had been spared as if by the trade of happiness — accepted the principle that each group did things inherent to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry are best suited for entertaining and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally natives of the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their task was to make sure that every family had a functional telephone that was used to run things.
Those remaining from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED happened, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled hastily for fear of being accused of blazing flames and fearing that those flames would catch up with them, opened restaurants serving labneh yoghurt and burning a water pipe, and continued their lives looking down at the ground and depressed with boredom.
Let everyone act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung had ever been disguised as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the big-footed ones.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage heads.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn already thought he was weird.
“It was funny,” he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing to see in the world except Ailinn's huge, crow-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailin seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because, like his father, he lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair and, at the same time, knocked over the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was only made of elder flowers, so he could not use it as a reason for the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what pervertedly attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand up to him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit me?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that in essence it had been the same as life here.
The same vast, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and more diabolical after the event than their smuggler and dispersing grandparents, wandered from the pub to the pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word for an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; an antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver — to suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, because sucking in itself was hostile.
Ailin Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailin also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go —just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go from the upstairs window —a man who was the cause of his own hard life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A bent, bowed, ashamed, beaten man who had lost all will to fight — why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event was just described, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher who worked at a private facility measuring Public Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in those areas of the country where the decrease, or even an end to, violence was most likely, given the money and energy spent on rooting it out.
"A great deal has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "to smooth out the inherent aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and who have mostly won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the towers that stretch across hedges, human gentleness has, over time, been rarely known.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the desires it generates.
The people weep over sentimental ballads, devour stories of overcome adversities, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty persists in both rural communities and urban cohabitation areas, and there is evidence of a new, more malevolent will to quarrel in homes, workplaces, our streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I would suggest that you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to invoke his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality, and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is entirely acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you have just suggested to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church — and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call innate energy and physical intensity.
Saying what happened if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo pink LED light proclaimed a guideline that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and a sung word is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice as she was sure her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not pour out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz used his fingers to form a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "by describing as 'mistakes' the acts our grandparents may or may not have done.
You are also going too far to say that they poured out their 'hate and distrust on others'."
A person in your position should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to go on, "no group in society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it further - we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to issue accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether justified or not, and even if there is a way to do so.
But what does the past exist for if we don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going over your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, as he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle driver driving on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as "evil-souled and furious".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho military denies planning attack; prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho army officials have denied having staged a strike to overthrow the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that his official residence had been surrounded by the army and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him that he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics". Police have been said to have attempted to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's defense forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause trouble," he told Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no party has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to match in every way the hallmarks of the revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to Lesotho military officials, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a calm atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements in the government of the Grand Coalition.
He thus denies that he has downplayed the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in a new location whose location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement, Microsoft said it would not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
In the public domain, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been selected as the location of the centre.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu office, which will take 500 jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company would not comment on how many employees the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa was announced on Monday by Kauppalehti.
Man charged with hit-and-run of girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man is accused of driving a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is charged with driving a girl at an intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors said Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 recklessly and causing injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at a Dundee Sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Images and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I took these photos myself at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera shooting settings to match the photos or video you want to take.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions underwater.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only handle 5 feet in depth, others up to 50-60 feet in depth.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our buying guide and digital camera reviews.
Take many pictures, many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose an image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it underwater, and the composition of the image can either be successful or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows you to fork, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is significantly reduced in depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in a pool, lake or ocean.
This will also give you more colors in your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you can see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important piece of advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the target so that the subject fills up the entire picture up to the frames.
China won't allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders, protesters vow revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided that Hong Kong voters would not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election, despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision will likely spark the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong business block after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communists the power to root out any candidate who does not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," said Democratic Party chairman, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general stand for election to the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom ceded Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents in the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through an nomination committee administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region in years.
The campaign for democracy was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the operation of the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would enter a new era of civil disobedience and would create waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement released online, the organizers said the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong officials have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement for its demonstrations threatening Hong Kong's lifeline - the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many take part in it and how long it lasts," says lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want concerns to spread that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
This would be a bad idea to invest.
There have also been stories in Chinese state media that Hong Kong democracy activists are the henchmen of the Western powers that foment revolution".
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
US Prom Tradition Hits British Universities: Private Jets for New Students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury-class mode of travel for today’s students.
In addition to a private jet, the company also offers other vehicles such as the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their belongings across the country in extremely loaded cars.
Combining this with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest-quality transfer to the university.
The company's representative said reservations have not yet come because the service has just been set up, but added that "students will start placing orders in the next few weeks."
The company believes there is demand for the service, although most students pay tuition fees of £9,000.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's college section, "this service plan seems to be really far from the life of the student majority."
Many students starting their studies this month will be shocked by the level of living costs, as the available financial aid in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge rise in basic living costs. Only next can we begin to think about where to find thousands to use for something as simple as arriving on campus.
Ipswich 'pig house' for sale
The real estate agents removed the sale picture of the house for sale in Suffolk after they noticed that a large pig was lying in the living room of the house in the picture.
The one-bedroom house, costing £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the picture ended up in the ad by accident and has since been removed," the company's spokesperson said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house".
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it is still visible in the ads.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where people have asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish striker Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea signed a four-year contract with French club Loic Remy.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.

I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be Dortmund's husband again.
“This is a great team and a wonderful environment,” Kagawa said.

In the Rosny-sous-Bois suburb on Sunday, 11 people were injured, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but hope of finding the survivors waned.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the Justice Ministry of the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
Salary increases are also to be discussed with the temporary Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite meeting representatives from the prison workers' organisation and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, director of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest by the Prison Workers' Association is also expected to involve members of the Workers' Trade Union of the Ministry of the Interior.
Basketball: Fan encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland’s victory today.
He was able to forget about his black U.S. match and overcome Ukraine's second half bloodsucking decisions.
But Salin passed all the credit on to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was about to pass out at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, it was dark, there was nothing I could do.
The noise and the white ocean were almost too much for me.
Salini's power moments included nine surfaces at a fast pace, ball busts, discs and twirls everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into a flow mode where everything worked out.
They come from somewhere, now to a very important place.
That's my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that others caught up.
It caught up with the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy pill and spirit creator, so it is no wonder that his example brought the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years of hiatus: The previous ones left us with an outrageous game of judges
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the Argentine World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach of Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was the overall player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament: it was a hot match against France in the early part.
"In the match's decision balls, the referee game was flagrant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then we went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th in the end.
Now Finland is again among the world champions as the Polish World Cup takes off this Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The strength of the players is about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average height of the players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever,” Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded, and the strain can be shared.
I am looking forward to the start of Finland.
Then it can be tough,” says Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in the attack in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder in the World Cup tournament.
Let’s hope we get to the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the World Cup in 1982.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita dog from mountain in Norway: 'These men deserve all the thanks'
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog got in trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a Facebook post that a Cita dog on Thursday injured his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it forward a little, but its legs just didn’t carry it,” Mikkelsen wrote in an update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
By the end of the night, the situation was starting to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog,” Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomi in his message.
Soon a German man came along with a mattress.
The mattress provided the Cita with stretchers like the one where the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a moment, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, the Cita was happily brought down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank them once more.
The Soinis answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes,” Mikkelsen says.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I’d like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soinis were already on their way home.
They had been told by Mikkelsen that Cita was feeling better!

Genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought for most of his youth that he had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, a misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in their motors, such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and toe flutter.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several surgeries of the Achilles tendon to straighten his legs. During the surgeries, after the doctor left the room, he quickly looked at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When I learned from them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17, he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, “Girl, I don’t think you have this disease because otherwise you’d already be in a wheelchair.”
I think you're suffering from something a lot less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was explained what CMT is, I thought I was delayed,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the disease.
100 migrants found in Macedonian coal wagon
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
According to police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and an additional 800-900 euros to get to Serbia.
Many illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a population of a few million on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled Syria’s bloody civil war.

In contrast, daily consumer goods sales have increased by almost one per cent.

Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto 3 reactor to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has provided Teollisuuden Voima TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas - value about 60000 euros
The Nastola municipal government donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi in Villähde.
The municipal government showed a fair sports spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syirakki.
Bottas gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
This year, the city will remove them, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the plot within two years.
We are honored that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has attended primary schools each year to tell about his sports career and life.
I hope it will continue, the mayor said.
The municipal manager estimates the value of the beach plot to be 40000-60000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for more than ten years.
Nastola has, with varying degrees of success over the decades, kept the sports successful with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World Spear Throw Champion Aki Parviainen and Aerobick World Champion Tuuli Matinsalo received the private home plots from the municipality and built the magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola after work and then moved to another place after life changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastolan and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes that Bottas will remain in his home municipality.
Hull hired striker Hernandez for club record
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won the Serie B and entered the Italian Premier League.
For the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two matches for a change to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he had also acquired Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russian Space Experiment Fails, Geckos Sent on Sex Trip Killed
The five little geckos that Russia has sent into space have died, the Russian Federation’s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The Gekos travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on geckos can be used to predict what effects weightlessness would have on a person if they stayed in a similar condition for longer periods of time, New Statesman said in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death of the geckos and the cause or cause of death will be determined.
According to Interfax, passengers christened as "sex geckos" were frozen.
What is also surprising is the fact that the fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip with difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terrorist suspect at Nice airport
France arrests suspected terrorist man at Nice airport on Saturday
The 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities tracked him down after he used money to lure a 16-year-old girl into Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her intentions and told the authorities that the family has no family in Turkey.
Officials say the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man’s actions before.
In France, authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people attracted to wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
The authorities estimate that around 800 French nationals or registered in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave for Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning
The basketball team’s hopes for a second place are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in its second World Cup match today.
If the opening defeat to the United States was expected, Ukraine would be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary victories.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in their first match of the Games on Saturday.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the 100 metres world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
“Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in its last defeat to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal wolf herd on the field, Möttölä said.
Alleged nude images of Hollywood stars spread online, some confirmed to be real
A number of nude images allegedly portraying well-known public figures are spread on the Internet.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "naked photo campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence representatives, which appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are real.
She took these pictures with her husband a few years ago.
Knowing that those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that was made to do this.
“I have sympathy for everyone who was the victim of the hack,” he wrote.
In contrast, actress Victoria Justice calls the photos that go by her own name fake.
Real or fake nude photos are also out there of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka Goalkeeper Criticizes His Own: "They Don't Work Enough to Get Out of Here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
The comments of goalkeeper Walter Viitala after Sunday's VPS match well describe the confused current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after a 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the first half.
He was not happy with the poor defensive play.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been brisk this summer, which is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a fast pace.
With the advent of player roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
“Some people don’t work hard enough to get out of here one day,” Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Hong Kong head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that you can’t expect immediate success from players when the players are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same lineup twice in a row.
Especially in defense, people have changed.
That is the main reason why we are in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a series jumbo after the VPS defeat, tied with the penultimate TPS.
There are still seven laps left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop one now.
We are not going to fall out of this series," the goalkeeper said.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier will return to television.
The Danish director is working on a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, announced the show on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to a statement from Zentropa, filming of the series should begin in 2016.
Trier is reported to be working on the script for the series starting this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also reported by Trier’s long-time partner, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a producer known for his hard sales speeches.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen or will never be seen".
“Hold your breath,” Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series for television.
01.09.2014 15:20 The store chain Lidl seems to have got the Finns on their side, at least if the results are to be believed.
The turnover of Lidl Suomi Kommandittiyhtiö Group, which runs Lidl’s operations in Finland, continued to grow during the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company also increased its earnings.

Growth was 25%.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The operating profit percentage was 7.1%.
The German-owned Lidl’s accounting period lasts from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company says that it paid EUR 13.7 million in tax to Finland for the financial year ending in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its chain of stores, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 people.
The first stores opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket Challenge
British Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken into treatment for her roughy while performing the Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jaw bone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so loud when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared, I felt my jaw began to stiffen," he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to hospital, where the chin was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Point of view on wolf howling (kin): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
I had a great feeling today.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France in the Marouss ball hall in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the 100 or so Finns who shouted into an otherwise empty hall with 20,000 spectators.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match?
In Bilbao, the number of Finnish fans is eighty times higher.
The 1995 European Championships was a search period for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Centre.
That victory opened the door to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä with lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, although everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, a total of just over 100 Finns were reportedly present.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are also journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can tell you the exact number of tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever that number is, it’s an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys are doing in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sport Sociology.
Surely both in Spain and at the Volleyball World Cup in Poland there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But that doesn't explain everything.
The sport itself has to be attractive.
Itkonen makes the popular culture of sport a part of it.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses cannot be moved.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and even the players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were lifted to the pedestal.
The volleyball crew made the same move a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to produce their top sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalistic support is, Itkonen points out.
Will the ball sports be able to shift this massive interest into domestic series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played for an average of hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Crying is a good question and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
The second school believes that interest is shifting.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experiential trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not of dual interest.
It's a challenge for social people in the midst of the drugs.
Backup of Bottas plot - almost 1.5 hectares from lake shore
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas with a beachfront home plot.
The municipal government approved the disposal of the 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
A free-time apartment will be added to the plot in the future.
Nastola has been monitoring Bottas’ success since his kart times.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has been acquired by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition condition in the area, of which six will be demolished by the municipality at a cost by the end of this year.
Bottas won Formula 1 in the Belgian Grand Prix this year.
He is 5th in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nasto and lived in Villähde of his childhood.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball players on the field, but also by top college players amateur Marcus Giron.
He says the shirt will help him track his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mop on the shirt and from there to a smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, remove the moped, which acts as a central unit.
The fashion house has not given the exact time for the shirt to start selling, nor has it even hinted at its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothing.
Californian Athos has brought a smart shirt and shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technovates.
Smart Ways to Save on Textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, soon starting his sophomore year, found a smart way to save costs.
He developed a system whereby students in later classes borrow their books for nominal remuneration rather than selling the books straight away.
“My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, plus a substantial sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says his books for the last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board of Trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying far less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores last spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are sourced from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
E-commerce
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is nearly $290, but the book is available from the online store of specialty books Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not distracted by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used at the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" for just $0.42.
The book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used on the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to education.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rental company’s rules, such as the fees for notes, highlighter pen usage and wear.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of regular papers may also be an issue.
Sometimes these books are rented, in which case the e-book is paid to the owner of the e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookstores.
The Chegg store offers the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors pays off, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it will help you make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was on hold for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain the book at full price at the university bookstore.
The Tampere Legion Theatre turns 20 years old

They believe that every person can change their own life.
Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, nearly twice as many people have died in fires as last year.
According to the Finnish National Rescue Agency (Spek), 55 people have been killed in 49 fires so far.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of reviewing the fire safety of the home.
At least the functionality of all home smoke alarms should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the fire extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed escape route from all home spaces.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived as far away as Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Australia’s Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after being stuck overnight in the Blue Mountains in Australia’s New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The relatives were worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent to search for the young, and the two were found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were lifted to safety Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have clashed violently with Russian tanks in the field.
According to a military spokesman, the opposing gunfire has been so accurate that the shooter is likely Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
A Ukrainian patrol ship caught artillery hits off the south-east of Ukraine in the Sea of Azov yesterday sank this morning, the border guard said.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard did not know where the ship was fired from.
The separatists said on social media that they were shooting at the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not invade Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Lavrov also said Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will draw conclusions from the actions of our partners,” Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused Malmö and Copenhagen to flood
Streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars.
Officials on Sunday estimated that it may take time for the flood to ease, although rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was given in advance for the rains.
Ari Mustala, meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area appears to be narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French socialists should "shut up and help France," Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show their feelings" for the troubled socialist president, whose composition of the new government did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves the respect of everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said and deserved a round of applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the controversial 35-hour week of French work in peace despite a proposal earlier this week by new Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to co-operate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused dissension by appearing at a meeting of socialist MPs who had expressed dissent and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the socialists' ongoing discord and said he did not believe the new government of Valls would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even a summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve Parliament and considered his party's election victory to be certain in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the top of the list in the May European elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several rival groups before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Po University political scholar Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Morning The pokka of Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda was badly betrayed in the recorded part of the programme.
The Morning Finland programme posted a funny video on its Facebook page last Thursday about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Good Morning from the day after the Finnish advertising puff broadcast, but the recording does not go quite smoothly.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in her words when she tries to pronounce the word budgeting, and her crazyness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their heads time and time again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, too,” the Finnish Facebook post said.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo agency for the magazine image, finished third in the series of portraits in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to take pictures.
I took this picture from four or five yards away.
The light and background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
It is clear from Meir's expression that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
At the time, the competition was successful with pictures of well-known people or events.
It’s great that you can succeed with other images, too, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn’t send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
The investigation of the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Drug Unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his doctoral dissertation on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special press release on the wall of a women’s travel school in Pirkkala caused a food buzz on social media, Yle says on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet at school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian option!
This is the story of a 15-year-old newspaper on the wall of the school.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleansing Service, says to Yle that the forgotten note on the wall is not true and it should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was once such an idea that was discussed with health care at the time.
Each student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and with a certificate from a doctor or public health nurse on a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave nutrition deficient, and the lack of meat or chicken may cause surprises for pupils’ parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The information comes from people closely involved in the matter.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, would have access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations were not held in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments and Apollo's representative declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when it was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brands, including a total of eight cruise ships, with a route map covering Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India's middle classes in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the number one choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has held most of the company's shares since the 2007 transaction, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current line-up in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company, the latter being the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting’s share of the company was 28%, Apollo’s 20 % and private equity firm TPG Capital LP’s share was 8 % from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document issued by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of the shares.
The Tampere City Council will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will give strong support to the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the time of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world needs to end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a widespread belief around the world that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be reflected in Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination,” Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi-dolphin strengthens the demands for the closure of dolphinarium operations.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It’s time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and begin to find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
They didn’t have time to experience a return to the dolphins’ original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will be able to experience even more life than an uninvigorated concrete pool,” Tuomivaara hopes.
Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will take part in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins on September 1st.
A demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take place against the beginning of the dolphin hunt in Japan.
During the hunting season, approximately 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for use by dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open talks on a new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called on the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the seceding region, Russian news sources reported.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's call for talks with pro-Russian rebels on an equal footing with the Kiev government is in line with his obvious strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and, in practice, to force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorossija independence to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to retake the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which was captured by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novorossija", "New Russia" - this term is reminiscent of the days of splendor before the Russian Great Power's revolutions.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said the planned peace talks will be an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections to be held on 26 October and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately enter into extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" is related to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov said.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a conflict within Ukraine".
The Kremlin representative's interim remark, intended to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's comments, stressed that the Russian regime deals with the rebellion of separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, effectively taking over an area with an ethnically Russian population of 2 million people.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to include even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and foreign relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually control over the area linking Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial seaports and historic coastal sites.
In the region between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products that are vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators — after new elections — consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions outside the core region of Ukraine over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest call to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the beginning of a larger effort to capture the entire strategically important coastal area as far as Crimea.
It has led to the massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels on Saturday, asking for further action to prevent further violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders called for additional sanctions to be put in place in the event of a re-emergence of the Ukrainian crisis in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian parachute jumpers captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese master Keisuke Honda already in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari hit first and, a little later, Jeremy Menez for a penalty kick.
Lazio also scored a penalty after his narrowing goal in the final moments of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez turned down Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez joined Milan this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan's former striker icon Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half-way through.
The match was reported to have an audience of 39,000 spectators.
Australian Celebrities and Gabi Grecko in Naked Photo Scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is appalled by hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been teetering since a series of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were released on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence as well as other superstars, including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Melbourne-based Grecko have also been apparently stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "this is disgusting."
All personal communication and photos should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon, based in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online newspaper as "disgraceful" and said that the victims "feel disgraced".
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, among them also two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merits include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesperson told TMZ that "it is an insolent violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in a tweet: "The publication of photos stolen from the phone is no different from the sale of a stolen product in any way."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as at home and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championships.
Take a look at the photos of the Fantasy.
Katowice in Poland was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland’s victory in the Spodek Arena.
It felt like I was playing at home.
The fans had such an impact on our game,” Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland lost 0-2 in the match, but won 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miraculous climb from behind six points.
Cuba was already leading the round 16-10, but after that the Finns were captivated.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when an airfield, a charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a high rate in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, more than 8,000 Finnish fans are present at the World Basketball Championships.
As if every basket in Finland was the winning basket of the match, US star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
The council meeting will not be broadcast live due to technical problems
The Kouvola City Council meeting will not be broadcast live today.
According to a statement from the city, the transmission is not possible due to technical problems.
The city of Kouvola regrets the situation.
You can watch the post-recording in a few days from the meeting.
