Changes in business subsidy practices - Region - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will be concentrated in four ely centres from mid-September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Etelä-Savo is responsible for operations in Mikkeli.
Under the new Business Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund subsidies may no longer be allocated to large companies unless they are entirely new activities.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be large municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support can continue to be granted for investments that improve the business conditions of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national aid will have a strength of about 30 people.
At least for the time being, they will all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Ely Centre of Etelä-Savo, works in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine
Russia acts consistently, even if it does not always seem so.
The head of the Department of Strategy at the National Defence College, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the conflicting news about Ukraine on Monday morning.
This has been the case for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not invade Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine says its paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank division near Luhansk airport, and that the tank division has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov called for an immediate cease-fire without conditions in the Minsk negotiations.
Russia denies that it is involved, and the outcome of the negotiations must be obtained immediately so that they can establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That’s the whole point, Siren said.
This is the big picture: we need to start negotiating and, in particular, Russia will get its own hold on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources cabin services to Norwegian company, layoffs people
Finnair will start purchasing cabin services from Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will initially apply to Finnair’s Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but it is planned to be extended at a later date.
The outsourcing of two routes will result in a total reduction of approximately 100 person-years in Finland, which will be implemented in the first phase through layoffs, the company said in a statement.
In addition, some 80 temporary workers in Asia will stop working when the routes are outsourced.
Finnair announced in June that it plans to outsource passenger services on approximately 20 routes over the next two years.
Outsourcing was decided when no agreement could be reached with the staff on the savings.
Outsourcing is expected to start in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve-related back pain, or sciatica pain, in those who do heavy shift work.
A study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection between sleep disorders and the sciatica tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance condition of firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect against pain, says Docent Sirpa Lusa, director of the study, in a statement from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.
The work of firefighters is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch for up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Are you familiar with the surprising new causes of water damage?
Easily damage other homes
Water damage is not always caused by a leaking pipe or tap, points out an expert from the Finnish Hosting Association.
We have been contacted when the breakup of the aquarium has caused water damage in the housing company, whether it is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the Finnish Hosting Association.
Furuhjelm points out that not only pipes and sewers are a common cause of water damage, but more and more new machines such as ice-burning machines have caused water leaks in homes.
Many people are not aware that machines such as washing machines or washing machines should not be left unattended.
The tap must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, otherwise the pressure in the pipes can lead to water leakage.
A resident may be considered guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case the resident shall be liable for damages.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can cover the damage, depending on the terms of the insurance and the case.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused the damage by negligence, the resident shall be liable for compensation.
If a resident has passed out in the shower on top of the floor drain, the neglect can often be proven, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and a maintenance worker comes to the apartment where a extinguished resident is found.
Furuhjelm says that due to the increasing spread of exhaustion over floor drains, two floor drains have now been installed in shower facilities in many student apartments.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although not to the extent that they were more popular in the past.
Even a dog’s water cup and a tipping over of a home wine can become real water damage.
I also know of a case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage,” Furuhjelm says.
The principle of liability for repairs always goes the same unless otherwise specified in the company’s Articles of Association.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and the housing company for damage to the structure as well as damage to other dwellings.
Water damage can easily destroy other homes, because concrete in the structure absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhjelm, battery leaks in apartments are particularly difficult, because radiators easily leak into insidious structures.
Water damage can now be caused by more common air heat pumps that produce condensate water.
Water should lead to a fixed drain or rainwater network, and not just a container.
The partner is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and debris from the balcony, a legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm advises that even if the housing company’s rules do not require, for example, a fixed drain hose for a washing machine, there may be a condition in the insurance that will result in the compensation not being received for this reason.
Be careful with your home insurance policy.
However, I consider the loose drain pipes in the bathtub, for example, of washing machines to be a great risk, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the drains should always be directed to the sewer pipe.
Removal of snow and water on the balcony
Monitoring of washing machine, washing machine, etc. with washing machine on.
Closure of taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
Cleaning the floor well in visible parts twice in half a year.
It is recommended that the drains are connected to the drains in a fixed way.
Check the faucets and their potential leaks
Regular freezer defrosting

FC Honka lost again and became a serial jumbo
At the Tapiola Sports Park on Sunday evening, two of the weakest teams of the Veikkausliiga fitness league met at the moment.
FC Honka, who last celebrated the victory in June, hosted the Vaasan Palloseura, which sailed in a seven-game unwinning streak.
The VPS took their last win just in July.
Sunday’s encounter with the Espoo team came to a good conclusion, as the VPS returned to the winning position 2-1 after a long time.
Vaasans head coach Olli Huttunen complained before the game about his team's inefficiency, but the confused Honka defence eased the VPS' goal scoring problems.
Extremely nervous execution.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't keep the ball," Huttunen evaluates his own performance.
In the first half, Hong Kong top-tier duo Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both of them were created as a result of the loose play of the tops.
The opening goal of the match was seen after only five minutes of play when Steven Morrissey directed Walter Viitala, a Honka goaltender who missed Sebastian Strandvall's shot.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the time the field went, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial shock, the Espoons got their games together and rotated the ball in the attacking end.
In particular, midfielder Carlos Portela and winger Roni Reindeer were eager to find places to commit, but the last decisions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to scoring was Hong Kong midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot from the 20 metres was, however, slightly missed by a VPS goal.
The VPS fought effectively, taking advantage of their brisk attackers and Honga's confusing pair of tops.
At half an hour, the Vaasans scored a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart were able to pass the two of them.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game head in the opening period and repeatedly created situations from his left side.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for the Spanish defense throughout the game.
"I shouted at halftime that if we lose, we lose with honor," Kuqi said.
In the second period, the introverted Honka fiercely sought a narrowing goal.
The team was twice close to hit until the third attempt was successful.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal from the center of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to level the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which allowed VPS to take dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey scored once with Viitala, but the Honka goalkeeper's flings kept the home team engaged in the game.
Towards the end, Honka got a little tired and couldn't get any more goals.
With the loss, Honka fell to the last of the Veikkausliiga, with seven more games remaining in the series.
Putin vows to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite harsh in a telephone conversation with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed outrage at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks,” La Repubblica said.
Putin’s message to Barroso was: “Don’t annoy Russia with new sanctions.”
Putin gave the number one Russian television channel an interview on the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict to be entirely internal to Ukraine and called on the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he strongly warned Kiev about the firing of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by" if people are shot dead at close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits that the actor’s work destroyed the family
The veteran actor and the theatre family grew up recognizing how the acting profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine will turn 70 on Friday, but the saying goes that age is just a number.
I don’t see any difference from a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
Mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but still works for a lot of men.
It was sometimes joked that not many plays would be made in this country without Esko Roinetta.
Currently, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre’s play How to Succeed Effortlessly in Business, Tampereen Työväen Teatteri’s Mind Rodent and Tampereen Comedy Theatre’s Quartet.
Roine will also appear in the upcoming Risto Rapper film.
Photo by Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career did not begin promisingly.
I didn't qualify for the Tiernaboy scene at school.
Forty or fifty years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the field that I dropped out of school and volunteered to join the army just to get into theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatrical roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how you count.
If you count things like the English, that every part of the TV series is its own show, there are over 600 TV stories.
After all, I was three years in the New Day, which was done three periods a week.
Last spring, I was killed when I didn’t have time to do it.
Commitments for autumn 2016
Esko’s older sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and make the wild roles as an anarchist grandmothers in Tampereen Työväen Teatteri Still Time.
My little brother is going to be on stage for years to come.
That's what it looks like, but you don't know at this age.
I always have to make a small reservation that I’ll be there if I’m alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
The years have also left their mark on the man.
Age does not come alone.
The knees have been operated on, the hip whistles and osteoarthritis bothers, but if you don’t let it bother you too much, you’ll be fine with these, says Esko Roine.
Roine was introduced to the TV audience.
From pirate radio and a quiz where he and Antti Einiö distributed hundreds of $100 bills.
It was Antti Einiö who distributed crops.
I tried to tell them they were hundreds, not hundreds.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an unnecessary Lieutenant Iron Rock.
He became a favorite of the policemen in Tampere, when he happened to have a similar kind of lieutenant in the department.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, "That Iron Rock is great!"
The working group was successful
The theatre works of Roine have remained in mind e.g.
The Producer and Master Class of the Helsinki City Theatre, the Death of a Salesman at the Tampere Workers’ Theatre and the Long Day’s Journey to Night by the Tampere Theatre.
What matters is that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's the team's success.
There have also been ritualizations.
Pekka Puupää’s role in the film is one such one.
There are others.
The reason is that I have agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result is neither me nor the viewers.
As an actor, you don’t get to choose your own work.
It’s only done kindly what you’re told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 1980s, he ran a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was an educational experience.
It didn’t work out at all when I tried to be the administrative director, actor and then the restaurateur of Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year I found out that there was no way to reconcile them.
Typical was that when the show was about to end or in between and I was wondering if I should turn on the sauna, there was a call from the restaurant that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the show.
Memories for Birthday
On her birthday, Esko Roine’s memoirs will be published by Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some sort of lump they've created from the memory of a face-wrestling man.
You know, when I was playing Zoom, they called me a face twister.
They didn’t know me by name.
The book has been made for years.
At one time, Roine told me that there is no news bomb on the market because he has not done anything so clever, or if he has, he will not.
I made a small opening sentence for the book.
I say in it that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, it is worth stopping reading here.
There’s a lot to do here, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher boasts that there is also a buzz of hilarious theatre school time.
It was a pretty normal student life, but as a kid I did all sorts of tricks.
It wasn’t as bad as in Turkey.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much I got from there other than the confidence that once I’ve gone to school, you know that it’s certainly not up to you if your actions don’t get better.
I didn't have to think about how good I would be if I'd gone to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen and got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Halttunen.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I got to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was in the same course with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
It’s hard to remember her divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in that the daughter went to the mother and the son to me.
I didn’t think it was a good decision, and I understand that the children are quite in agreement now as adults.
In theatre circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be distributed.
In my case, I did a lot of work at the time.
I was in the theater for almost every thing.
Then there was the TV and the radio.
I worked long hours and my family life suffered.
On a holiday maybe a free day.
Esko Roine will celebrate at Tampereen Työväen Teatteri on 7 September.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was in my 50s and in my 60s.
When we had such an easy-to-move play, I thought we’d keep the 70s now, so we can get them out with one beat.
According to Roine, there are no celebrations on the actual birthday.
I think it's the night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have booked a job for that day.
Or maybe it’s a weird night off that I’m going to have on a night off,” Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about the production chain
Some smaller aircraft manufacturers in the UK are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems could derail ambitious plans by large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of aircraft manufacturing companies are enjoying an unexpected number of aircraft and engine development plans that are currently being implemented simultaneously.
Aviation and Defence
While some enjoy the order backlog, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems and price pressure at hand in the production chain.
"It is quite true that there is price pressure, especially now that production volume is challenging," said Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, representing some 240 suppliers of aircraft production in the north-west of England, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans match these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to realize these production volumes," Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the expansion of aircraft construction is part of the problem.
Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, who produces the wings of gas turbines, said the company was having a "challenging time" when several new construction plans began to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very low production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we had to try to keep moving forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
A number of industry players believe that there is a need for more placement and coordination between small suppliers if the UK is to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation industry after the US.
Geoff Ford, president of Ford Aerospace and engineer of fine mechanics from Tyneside, said the order sum should increase producers’ confidence and desire to expand and increase production capacity, as there will be plenty of work to do.
"If this doesn't happen, we will lose in the race against other countries," Ford said.
A few major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a aircraft and engine parts company in the FTSE 250 index, acquired UPECA, a Malaysian aircraft parts manufacturer, for £75 million.
MB Aerospace acquired companies in North America and Poland last year.
“It’s possible to buy start-ups that create new business, but in reality, the most slow down of production is the limited design and the number of engineers,” says Gallagher MB of Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has been passed on to them by large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN’s aircraft manufacturing unit, who is also the chairman of the ADS, a UK aviation trade agency, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
The supply chain is under pressure, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
“More important than volume is the introduction of new technology and advanced processes,” says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned the lessons from the mistakes and are now more cautious in order not to increase the number of constructions too quickly.
As Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it faced major difficulties as the company made a loss and factories and the production chain were struggling to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's aircraft manufacturing unit, says the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to manufacture the jet engine.
"The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to increase their activity," Wood says.
Boeing CEO James McNerney said the company’s production chain had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’ passenger jet manufacturing unit, said the company would do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase production of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Perhaps one of the journalists will not succeed, and our job is to try to prevent this situation, as well as support the suppliers and look for alternatives, but have to expect major problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the editor's responsibility.
That’s my job and that’s Airbus’s.”
Hong Kong protest groups begin 'age of civil disobedience' as Beijing bans open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Pro-democracy activists spread out on the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
Pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong stress that demonstrations can flare up and vow to ensure that the city begins an "age of civil disobedience" in opposition to the reforms proposed by the Chinese government on elections.
Thousands of protesters defied the coming rain against the shimmering horizon of Hong Kong as they wandered to a demonstration organised by the pro-democracy Occupy Central group in front of the law enforcement council on Sunday night, where protesters urged people to take part in a large-scale sitting demonstration to paralyze the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place just hours after Beijing had announced that it would deny voters the right to publicly propose candidates in the 2017 mayorial elections, thus defying months-long demonstrations that further increase the division of the city.
Protesters take part in the start of the Occupy Central protest in front of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want a fair and decent election," says 24-year-old website administrator Dion Tse, who attended Sunday's demonstration with her 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
China's highest legislative body, the People's Congress of China, approved plans for electoral changes that allow only two to three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, approval by the 1200-person Nomination Committee is required and opposition politicians feel that this effectively prevents dissenting political views from entering the ballots.
Protesters are taking part in a demonstration held in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
According to police estimates, more than 2,600 people were currently taking part in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when around 100 protesters led by a Scholarism student group gathered late Sunday at the Grand Hyatt, where Communist Party member Li Fei was to stay overnight after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and the Federation of Students.
Or, in order to comply with the law, however, did not say the exact date on which the blockage of roads will be carried out, but urged participants to closely monitor the development of the situation "over the next couple of weeks" while adding that the city is officially entering an "age of civil disobedience".
Benny Tai answers questions from the press.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at a Sunday demonstration, standing in front of a billboard of two figures representing disobedience in China.
That person is taking the center with you!
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old convening representative of Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for high school student protests are underway and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate by refusing to teach.
“In addition to academic responsibility, we have social responsibility,” Wong says.
In Beijing, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending the "international demands" of universal suffrage is a "waste of time" and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to "mix society and mislead it."
"Practical proposals such as the nomination of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, insisting that the method of election should be created to fit the actual situation and legislative framework of each society.
The bill on universal suffrage can only be passed into law if a large majority, i.e. two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislature, supports it, which means that the 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong could be drawn into prolonged political debate if the reform proposal is vetoed.
"It would hinder business and the development of the city," he says.
Nearly 800,000 people voted in an informal poll conducted by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands.
As many as 172,000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the pro-Beijing and anti-Occupy Central march on 17 August attracted some 88,000 participants. Estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although estimates by police and organizers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured in lightning strike at New York beach
A lightning strike on a beach in New York City resulted in the injuries of three people.
The fire department said the men were injured at Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx on Sunday night as heavy storms passed over the area.
The injured men are hospitalized.
The extent of the injuries is not known.
Lightning struck as heavy thunderstorms swept over the city.
Storm rains, thunderstorms and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Dozens of commercial flights to the city's airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not to be liked.
This is the latest advice for network users for employees and managers, and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea to recognize such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident, i.e. boring and mundane, or the benefits it brings are so small that it is not worth pursuing.
While a historian at Harvard, Drew Gilpin never repeated anything he had already published so that people would not think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as a university rector, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message across widely.
Bob Hoffman, an advertising consultant, believes that television and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news online does not mean that the Internet is a good inter-advertisement — just as the first phone was a popular communication medium but a bad option for advertisers.
According to psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson, one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they solved the problem collaboratively, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not told about the collaboration at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between two units, performance expert Dave Paradi advises you to forget about Microsoft’s SmartArt and instead use Diagramr.com, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital bans cataract surgeries due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily removed from office, and the UK National Health System (NHS) stopped directing patients to cataract surgery at that private hospital after problems with the hospital became apparent.
Two people sought emergency care at Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that it was in contact with 19 patients in treatment on July 26 and invited them to an "urgent clinical examination".
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized and said that an investigation has begun after the doctor's dismissal.
The matter came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated in Mount Stuart sought emergency care because of eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were examined on the same day, have needed repair surgery.
Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not referred patients to treatment since the problems arose in Mount Stuart.
David Sinclair, interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients involved quickly.
Whenever we refer patients to a service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, director of patient safety at the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, "patient safety is always an absolute priority, so it is important that these cataract surgeries are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "sincerely for forgiveness to all patients who suffered complications".
The company announced that "as soon as we found out about the potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital were called to all the patients in question".
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered physician since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgeries in various parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgeries he performed have been excellent, with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended from office until the matter is investigated.
What is "4chan"?
Infamous anonymous messaging site first published leaked nude photos of celebrities
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when posting stolen images?
"4chan" was founded in 2003. It is a conversational messaging site, which is barked up as much as is praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a single, continuously accessible profile, and their posts are not retained.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute, as newer publications replace them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known memes on the web (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or downright criminal content on the site.
The site's most popular bulletin board is /b/, which is intended for mixed conversations and regularly displays NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This can include tame porn, but also brutal and shocking images. An anonymous hacker posted stolen photos of celebrities specifically on this bulletin board over the weekend.
CytRx invests in cancer drug research and development
CytRx aims to cure cancer, or at least slow it down.
A biological pharmaceutical company based in Los Angeles, recently hit by a controversy over stock sales, specialises in the research and development of cancer drugs.
The most promising drug is aldoxorubicin, which is a more advanced form of the one commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials with aldoxorubicin for soft tissue sarcomas, Kaposi sarcomas associated with AIDS, and recurrent glioblastomas or brain tumours.
It’s like a guided missile that travels directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body,” said Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Aldoxorubicin contains a so-called blender technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates in tumors, allowing the drug to travel directly to cancer cells.
The compound will only deliver the drug in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to be given more and more doses of cancer medicine.
“It’s like a missile that goes directly into the tumor and not the rest of the body,” said Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year, raising $86 million for operation maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a crucial Phase 3 clinical trial of alternative treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and adipose tissue.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to apply for a drug license from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman said.
The drug could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data from a previous clinical study by CytRx published in December showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was "we haven't seen clinical data on how much it differs from the drug itself," said Andrew Fein, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co., an investment firm.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial, as it is significantly different from the previous study with good results.
“A lot of things have to go right,” he says.
Fein compares the development of pharmaceuticals to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money is invested to find that one vein of gold, and the investment will continue until that vein of gold is found," he says.
The money is spent on research and development for so long that the medicine can be commercialized.
Several shareholders have sued CytRx because they felt it gave a better picture of their success than reality.
In the lawsuits, the company is accused of hiring an investment relationship firm, DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotechnology company for articles published on pages such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the lawsuits, it was not clear from the articles that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed the articles, "which were contrary to practice".
Several articles about the company were also removed from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the lawsuits.
"I have neither the time nor the energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented employees who tend to seek employment in biotech centers such as San Diego, San Francisco, and Boston.
"In many ways, this is a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst magazine's views
The price of shares in CytRx rose to $8.08 on January 10 and then fell to less than $3 in April when accusations of advertising the shares became public.
According to Analyst magazine, lawsuits and negative publicity have lowered the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to bypass this issue as long as the notion remains in place".
In the name of the law, a cameraman was killed while filming
The photographer of a series based on true events, which is also presented in the name of the Law in Finland, died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting.
The cameraman filmed a shooting between an Omaha police patrol and a suspect in an armed robbery at a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from his injuries.
According to TMZ, police reported that in the shooting, not only the cameraman but also the person suspected of armed robbery died.
One of the first reality TV shows to air in the name of the Law has been in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been broadcast on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outside factor comes to play a decisive role in the court of appeal proceedings that began today with the killing of Ulvila.
Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal is now considering the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court with new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Appeal is that the verdict will be handed down by the end of this year.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal released Auer in 2011.
At the time, the court considered the possibility of an outside factor to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening speech, the Prosecutor General, Kalle Kulmala, explained the prosecutor’s view on the night of the murder and the factors that exclude the possibility of an outside perpetrator.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether an outside factor has entered the house, which has killed Jukka Lahti in the manner and time described by Anneli Auer.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer’s report,” Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek a divorce.
At some point, we moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife," Kulmala described the events of the night of the killing on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several facts prove that there was no external factor present.
For example, an emergency call recording does not hear any sounds from an outside factor.
Auer's eldest child -- the daughter -- said during the interrogation that he saw the perpetrator as he exited the door of the fireplace room.
The acquittal of the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
Prosecutors say his daughter’s findings are not true.
"The daughter did not see an outside factor in the parents' bedroom, although she visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is linked to the possibility of an outside factor.
Jukka S. Lahti’s sister has told about the events after the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the daughter only told the hospital that she only saw the body of Lahti when she visited the murder scene in the fireplace room.
Auer’s defence intends to present to the court lines of investigation, the role of which has not been sufficiently clarified by the police, according to the defence.
When the Vaasa Court of Appeal acquitted Auer three years ago, the court considered the DNA of a foreign man found in a halo to be one of the indications of an outside factor.
The sample later turned out to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Bureau of Investigation's laboratory
At that time, a DNA sample of 700 people was taken as mass samples.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative lines of investigation were excluded," defence lawyer Juha Manner said.
One of the defense's new witnesses tells us about a possible outside factor.
A woman from Ulvila told police about a porila man who had confessed to the act, according to the woman.
The man was questioned by police this summer.
The prosecutor made the decision that the porilaism man had nothing to do with the homicide.
The prosecutor made a request for an investigation because the prosecutor suspected the woman had lied in her report.
Another new witness in the defence is a nurse who worked at Satakunta Central Hospital on the night of the murder.
The Satakunta District Court sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the district court’s judgment, the possibility of an outside factor is at odds with, among other things, Auer’s children’s stories, the noises referring to an outside factor that are missing from the emergency centre recording, and the time required for the events to take place.
The verdict was 2-1.
The minority judge wrote that conflicting evidence in criminal proceedings must be interpreted as in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s story must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions in the story, she had observed an outside factor exiting the door of the fireplace room.
Auer's two oldest children have been invited to be heard by the Court of Appeals.
The daughter was first heard in person in the District Court of Satakunta last year.
When heard in court, he no longer remembered the night of the murder.
Auer's second-oldest child named his mother's killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me what happened the night of the murder behind a closed door.
He also said that Auer was planning to kill him for six months.
As a plaintiff, the son has no obligation to make a statement in the Court of Appeal.
The court hearing will continue today with a hearing with Anneli Auer.
The hearing will continue tomorrow, if necessary.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
Putin’s actions in Ukraine have made him the number one enemy.
Putin is scheduled to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and there is fierce debate in Australia over whether or not he should be allowed to enter.
Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia over the weekend to ban Putin from attending a summit attended by more than 4,000 delegates from some of the world's most influential nations.
"We don't think this person has anything to do with the G20 meeting," Maria Alyokhina told the audience at the Sydney fully packed opera house during the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the verge of a 'perfect war', and Putin calls parts of Ukraine 'Novorossia' or 'new Russia'. So is it necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he is "weighing the decision".
According to Mike Callaghan, director of the G20 at the Lowy Institute Research Center, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it will allow into the country, but this is an international meeting," he says.
Just like when New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted International Monetary Fund meetings, "it's not the host's job to forbid someone from being invited to come," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said he was "weighing the decision" after Russia's disapproving actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
As Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on its own.
"However, this is an important issue that I will be weighing a lot, and I believe that other countries will do so too in the coming weeks," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event will last for two days and will involve a wide range of representatives from the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies, which comprise approximately two-thirds of the world’s population and make up 85% of the world’s GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given the questionable task of balancing different interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best way of dealing with the matter is to take advantage of the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand that President Putin make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to provide an account of his actions," Callaghan said.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to bring these things up.
Pro-Russian rebels are preparing weapons for an attack on Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This is the last thing on Putin’s mind.
He hardly states that "I need to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Opposition leader Bill Shorten regards Putin's arrival in Australia with "very reservations", but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the prime and foreign ministers to discuss with other states and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, and I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines disaster and the lack of pity, responsibility and proper cooperation associated with the plane crash completely and now, with thousands of Russian soldiers swarming along the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have great reservations about welcoming Putin to Australia.
German business world criticizes 'self-sufficient' Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become "too confident" and "self-sufficient" as government policies threaten the country's hard-earned competitiveness.
Criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government comes at a time when Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing down, giving rise to concerns about its ability to drive economic growth in a stagnant euro area.
Criticisms of business leaders are the result of political decisions fiercely opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the lowering of the retirement age of certain long-term employees to 63 years.
“I think the biggest threat right now is over-trust in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world’s largest chemical manufacturer.
The EU economy
He says: "In general, there is a feeling that we are doing well, that we have money to spend and that unemployment is relatively low, so what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
It is clear from the policy of the German Government that we do not focus on growth and are not a favourable environment for companies, but instead focus much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industrial Association BDI, "The situation in Germany is now good.
Over the next ten years, however, every developed economy will have to change. ...[Germany] The reform programme will not achieve as much progress as it did in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Unemployment in Germany has remained at a low level and the budget is almost in balance, and consumption, which has already slowed down once again, is on the rise.
However, the decline in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2 per cent in the three months preceding June compared with the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make quantitative stimulus more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "move from public consumption back to public investment", for example by focusing future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
In Kerber's view, Merkel's government will destroy the fruits of his Social Democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder's strict policies in the early 2000s.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familianunternehmen Foundation for Family Business, "Germany is still in a good position compared to other countries.
It is thanks to companies rather than government policies. . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social assistance and restricting the freedom to run a business are the wrong way to go about it.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more frankly, saying that the government's recent decisions are a "disaster".
Germany threatens to lose everything it has worked so hard for, only to please the electorate.
This is my main concern right now," the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of policy, which have caused costs that undermine industry's competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher hands off at music festival after security blocks access to fan
Actress Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indio, California, where she reportedly got into a fight with a tight security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
A fan of Kutcher tried to approach him backstage at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival in California, and then the situation got out of hand, TMZ reported.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to greet and shake his hand.
When the star in the Half-Man series went to greet the fan, an overzealous security guard intervened and caused a blizzard.
The actor and the security guard got into a handshake, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to hold Kutcher back.
After breaking up with his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is one of the stars of the former '70s show.
The blizzard occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically been removed from the regular cast of the hit series after he released a video in which he calls the show "junk" and urges fans not to watch it.

Bacteria in the Baltic Sea Killed a Vacationer
Six people have been infected by a bacterium from the Caribbean that has settled in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacterium is most effectively spread in brackish waters over 20 degrees.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Health and Safety Agency at Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LAGuS), told The Local.
Bacteria are found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks now, and it is possible that his leg needs to be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound to his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after discovering on the way home that his leg has turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus in the foot.
"My husband certainly would not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger," his wife Sonja Bruehl told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused to the patient and his family by blood poisoning could have been avoided if the information had been better available.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors have been urged to follow the infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official announcement was issued.
Cool temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"[Monday's] test results showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly," Dr. Will says.
The cold weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the bacterium that causes cholera, is particularly dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response, such as in patients with HIV or diabetes and elderly people.
Men have a higher risk of developing the disease than women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If the bacterium gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
In the event of an infection, the risk of death is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating the seafood it infects, although Dr. Will says this is not the case.
Pollution of food from the sea is more common in the Southern Hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus last caused poisoning in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: Chest removed due to suspected cancer
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen works out and works out hard, but has also had to worry about his health.
It’s amazing that Vieno Kekkonen is already 80 years old.
I am surprised that there are so many years of age that can happen all of a sudden.
I didn't realize I was this old.
80 years sounds like a lot of fun.
Her birthday is spent with her family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was arranged for him by the Folk Music and Pensioner's Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on stage in Kekkola, the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was overwhelmed by the party, the birthday hero tells of an event where a stage for three hundred people was full of congratulations.
A couple of days later, we met in Muhos to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are few aspects of Vieno Kekkonen that have not been seen in public.
There is one thing he has never said publicly before: in 2006, he had his other breast removed.
There was an unclear finding in my chest at such a point that it was decided to remove it altogether.
In the end, it wasn’t cancer, which I was happy about.
In the same operation, a new breast was made, so it was quite a big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a way in vain, as the knowledge of an unclear finding would have been a heavy strain and cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved that there was nothing serious,” says Vieno Kekkonen, pointing out that it is certainly harder for younger people to lose their breasts.

A farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The discussion about the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically motivated opinions.
In particular, during the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have continued the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient discharges into the Baltic Sea.
In the same breath, rapid action has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer seems to be a superior nutrient expert compared to a few environmental scientists and with their help to experienced suppliers.
The farmer knows that nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as they are harvested from there.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires close monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also leached into water bodies after fertilization restrictions, but a clear reduction in emissions has been visible here for years.
Farmers are willing and willing to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that it is impossible to reach zero levels.
“If we want to have roughly the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case,” says Jyrki Aakkula, MTT’s Director of Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
This past summer brought large amounts of blue-green algae to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers agreed that the algae had its growth power from the ocean’s own phosphorus reserves.
Phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly from agriculture in coastal states in the past decades, but that alone does not explain the stocks.
Waste water treatment in the growing cities of the Baltic Sea shores was on the back burner until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned wastewater in Greater Helsinki, and they were not seen as a problem except with regard to the pollution of their own shores.
Beach pollution was prevented by the construction of a sewage pipeline in the open sea as late as the 1980s.
The quality of the water there has certainly improved over the years.
In the past, nutrients that have ended up in the sea will not leave the country, even if agriculture is completely discontinued in Finland.
Yet every summer the blue-green algae debate and the accusations made are always directed at today’s agriculture.
Public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when used to realize political passions.
Under the leadership of its chairman, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, the Greens are pushing for major changes to the environmental standards of agriculture.
As a springboard, Niinistö has used the summer algae discussion.
Niinistö has accused the producer lobby of being old-fashioned and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some political rhetoric.
Most of the specific water protection projects are based on cooperation between the MTC, farmers and environmental management.
Niinistö’s offensive genre serves more to catch urban green votes than water conservation.
I guess that's the idea.
With tough talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the task of the MTK is to take care of the livelihoods of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only amount of money that has been spent on agriculture is the cuts in the amount of money that is spent on agriculture.
The repeal of the mining tax will not go through: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw the mining tax in the trash seems doomed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will abandon it without modification.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included a rule in the new initiative that could limit employers' additions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to rush through the abrogation process in a state of general confusion and in the face of the clear indignation of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original repeal initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes to, and replaced it with a new bill that it described as being primarily related to taxes, pension contributions, social security, and family welfare.
Originally, it was an initiative to reverse a "failed" mining tax as well as other decisions such as a pension contribution for low-income people ($3.6 billion savings), a earnings-support bonus ($1.3 billion) and a bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
Palmer United Party (PUP) leader Clive Palmer did not approve the government move.
"A poorly planned mining tax repeal initiative will not be passed in the Senate without a pension contribution for low-income people, a earnings-support bonus, and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Shadow Finance Minister Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide the mandatory amount of pension contributions, giving the Finance Minister all the decision-making power.
"This is unprecedented," he told reporters in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other increases, with the Labour Party's 12 percent guarantee for pension contributions moving up to 2034.
"It's in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will of course resist by all means," Bowen says.
The guarantee now stands at 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to halt future increases.
Man's body found at Brighton Beach
Sussex police recovered the body of an unidentified man before the high tide of two in the afternoon, and police closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
Police officers and the coroner are working to determine the circumstances under which the body was found on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Investigators go through a list of missing persons to determine whether the missing persons have a connection to the body.
Police could not confirm whether the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
Mexican police say one fatality in explosion at border
According to Piedras Negras police, an apparently accidental explosion at a customs building on the Mexican-U.S. border caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas serves as the operational director of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press news agency that the woman who died in Sunday's explosion suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in the overnight accommodations of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border security.
Three Atlantic City casinos to close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos will close their doors this month
Male customer plays at Showboat Casino, which is due to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29 July 2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City as three casinos deal their last cards to the table
Three casinos are closing their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-lighted metropolis, known for its cash machine clinking, can no longer count on gaming revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press news agency reported.
There will be more unemployed as Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
The expected closure of three casinos, one of which had only been in operation for two years, is the city's latest disaster after the story of the Atlantic Club center ended just eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city’s casino employees, 8,000 people, will be out of work.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for the poor economy-stricken Atlantic City, the AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained many more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania cut much of Atlantic City’s once huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, who was previously opposed to gambling, looks at its share of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), it is difficult to accept the plant supplier Areva’s new estimate that Olkiluoto’s third reactor will not be available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the head of the power plant project, this is due to the fact that the construction work is already largely completed and the number of ongoing works is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen states in the release that TVO welcomes all initiatives that can speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to Areva’s statement, the project’s recent delays have been mainly due to the approval of the reactor’s automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in an arbitration court in which Areva has claimed compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's claims to be unfounded and demands approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders gathered in Stockholm today during the 24th International Water Week. They called on energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, ensuring sufficient water and energy supply for an ever-growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are often interdependent.
Energy is needed to pump, store, transport and purify water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two resources are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the International Water Institute in Stockholm, which organized Water Week, said in the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water actors to find solutions that will allow all peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, winner of this year's Water Week Water Prize, described water as an enabling foundation for growth that is needed by both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that "developing countries face major challenges.
They must mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that "[to the water crisis] there is no permanent solution anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water actors during more than a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, at a ceremony at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make decisions that make sense for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: The cost of flying corpses
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami crashed, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of people in the past, and this was certainly not the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1,000 Central American migrants die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
The first city is ready to die.
Ironically, however, when they arrive at the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place to stay: either a refuge, an effort board up or a place to spend time waiting for a better opportunity.
Few people imagine they will die there, and as death approaches, many are planning to return home.
There is a disproportionate number of foreign-born and temporary residents living in the cities favoured by migrants, where death and repatriation are a constant source of work.
An estimated 20 percent of the bodies of those killed in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most human remains (HR, a short form of professional slang for human remains) are flown home from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the industry, about 80 percent of this traffic travels abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in Central and South America as well as to several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home comes at a cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the human remains flown back home by the airline in 2013.
Returning corpses is not cheap: prices can range from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and public health requirements for the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in immigrant-popular cities sometimes organize funeral communities to help with costs because the return of corpses is expensive, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programs originated from such communities, founded by Italians, Jews, and Greeks living in New York City —the first immigrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in many of their preferred cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few immigrants plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, foreigners who have died without a will are subject to Sharia law, even if the laws on inheritance of a deceased home country are different.
The entire property of the deceased is frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia court.
Aer Lingus, the centre of Dublin, is a network of carriers carrying human remains (
2013) reflects the multicultural demographics of the city and Irish people.
The airline suspended the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a city favored by immigrants or lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
Death in an immigrant city abroad, however, means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for the immigrant - decisions about whether to belong to a local or global community, the universe or the earth, short-term or eternal.
The Centre Party and the Left Alliance make a mid-term issue of inequality
The opposition parties, the Centre Party and the Left Alliance, intend to ask the government an interim question on the livelihood of low-income people and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate discussion about people’s livelihood problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The growing inequality is also visible between different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties noted in their press release.
According to the parties, cuts and tax increases in the government’s budget for next year will target low-income people, such as students, the unemployed and pensioners, family members and ordinary working people, while food, medicines and housing, among other things, will continue to be more expensive.
In fact, nearly half a million people are already unemployed, the parties said in a statement.
The income problems of employed people have also worsened.
Parliamentary groups from the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the Finns Party, has already announced that it will leave an interim question on the resources of the police and internal security.
The autumn session of the Parliament will begin tomorrow, Tuesday.
New York City's West Indian Day Parade Begins Soon
Caribbean culture is once again in the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and where politicians can see and be seen.
The annual parade is held Monday in Brooklyn.
It exudes traditional celebrations of pre-fast carnivals, and part of it are dancers who wear complex, often made of feathers.
Brooklyn Region President Eric Adams is this year's festival champion, but there are many other faces known for politics to be expected as well.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the public a week before the primary.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also included violence in previous years.
Police have said they will try to keep the event safe through additional measures, including monitoring the activities of gangs operating nearby.
Is it worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
There's no point in answering that question.
This figure of speech, that is, a question to which no answer is expected, but which hints in the direction of a particular answer, seasons both high-flying speeches and a more mundane exchange of words.
The opening words of Ciceron's famous accusation of Catilina are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same goes for the questions my wife asked: “Why shouldn’t I warm a five-day-old chicken for my children?”
Why are you so tense?
The difference theme is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidiously rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree with it.
David Williams, author of a 19th-century material writing guide, described the rhetorical question as "words addressed to something admirably designed to produce a strong sense of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they present is the impossibility of disagreeing."
The Art of Bending
Rhetorical questions can be asked in succession if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several rhetorical questions asked in succession, designed to express sadness or indignation, are called epiplexy.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: “What profit do you get from oppressing me?
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the same as a person sees?
Rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypophora, which is what happens when you ask a question and answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?
Parru!
That's right, Moses!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: “What is the only food that the children have eaten and from which they may have become sick?”
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, rhetorical questions do not tend to try to persuade, although rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you are trying to talk someone out of it, instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted, or getting angry at someone’s stubbornness, you might want to use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get the other person to accept their own opinion.
If the audience agrees with the claim "It's not nice when it's so sunny out?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim, which ties the speaker and the audience better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no dissenting opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached rather than seeking consensus, the speaker may appear, well, complacent.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weak point in the argument.
In newspaper headlines, the rhetorical question is all too often by far the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the UK Conservative Party's risky campaign slogan in the general election in 2005.
The party lost.
For some, the discovery of such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, made famous by British journalist John Rentoul) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition to find the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", sung by pop star Gary Glitter before she was revealed to be a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written a book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researcher: The time for a federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries, it was still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise on the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that achieving peace in eastern Ukraine will require discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to Saari, Ukraine’s transformation into a federal state is a priority of Russia’s ambitions in a certain way.
Ukraine has no reason to doubt that Russia is trying to influence Ukraine’s domestic policy.
If a federal solution is not reached, another option from Russia’s point of view could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the allegations, although pro-Russian rebels, for example, have themselves reported that their troops have been fighting "vacation, volunteer Russian soldiers".
Upi’s leader: Katainen planned an influential task
Tiilikainen reminds us that the job description is new and still taking shape.
According to him, the idea is that Katainen would in some way coordinate or even lead the Commission’s work on competitiveness and employment.
One of the priorities of the Commission's programme for the new period is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That’s how we are at the heart of the Commission’s power,” Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen’s background, financial know-how and role during the economic crisis give him opportunities for good standing within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be without portfolio, i.e. Katainen would not have a directorate-general under his authority.
Instead, Katainen would become a team leader in the area of EU competitiveness and employment, allowing him to have other portfolios related to the sector to coordinate in addition to the Finance Commissioner’s portfolio.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Military Mothers: Up to 15,000 Russian Soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers organization, as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and there are currently more than 7,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
Human rights groups say at least 200 Russian soldiers have been killed.
According to the organization, the hospital in the town of Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is crowded with wounded people in the Ukrainian war.
Mothers of soldiers collect their information from relatives of soldiers.
NATO estimates that there are more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte: “After a little drink comes a story”
Big Brother Jussi and Andte went to think about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
On Monday night Jussi, on the basement side, was riding an exercise bike with Andte, one of the inhabitants of the Manor.
The duo wondered what their actions looked like to the viewers of the show.
Not until he sees her, he said.
Jussi thinks that most of the time in the BB-house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or missions make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
It is more about waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the manor spent the evening on a damp note on Wednesday, and alcohol, especially, made Andte talkative.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made the man’s life in the house more meaningful now that he had been able to talk about them with the other residents in a little hip-hop.
Take a little drink and there will be a story, Andte admits.
Watch Andte's interview on ISTV's video!
Anna Abreu Reveals Her Body Ideals in We Women
Anna Abreu says in Me Naiset that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she took a break.
Anna, tired of touring at the time, thought she would gain more energy by losing weight.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago, Anna was dreaming of a body like Victoria's Secret.
It was a Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good and thought I wanted to lose weight,” Anna told the newspaper.
After training her body with gigs and music videos, Anna says that she is not a lust trainer, although she has been named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, who is in Timmi's condition, works out in the gym and does boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but that I can lift a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to indulge.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I take an unhealthy overdose and don't wonder if I got any more pounds.
I wonder what my body thinks.
I hate it when I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Corporate profit sharing pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are Australian listed company executives today merely seeking to please a large crowd by yielding to the shareholders' wishes for greater profit distribution and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power transferred from the board of directors of companies to the shareholders served by the board?
Profit distribution is the most important thing, it was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programs and more profit sharing have risen significantly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the flip side of the coin is that capital consumption is falling faster than analysts have predicted. This fact causes many to ask whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and sufficient focus on growth in the near future and long-term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business through other means.
For example, more funding will be obtained from the cheap stock market.
From the company’s point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Even if funds raised on the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that generosity towards shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of this wave of purchase programs (and cancellation of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period a "period of capital decline" during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programs was $3.7 billion and the expected unrealised capital raising programs were $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to view spending capital as a curse word in one of the headlines of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, unofficial evidence has been around for months.
Glenn Stevens, director of the Australian Central Bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "combat spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow consumption of capital tends to lead to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
According to Credit Suisse, "the reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% over the past two years.
Estimates of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase the consumption of capital.
This quick glance seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some evidence of corporate obedience.
If I got a coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of a stock is not important, I would be... Well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
CEOs follow stock prices very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short- and long-term bonus packages of CEOs are defined by the value of the shares, and the position of managers depends on it.
CEOs like to say that some decisions (whether through acquisitions, increased investment in an organization, or profit sharing) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for a medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted outlook on the investment market.
That is why the current wave of conservatism seems to be agreeing to the short-term goals.
In the opinion of those who assessed cheap stock markets and advocated saving capital, this concern does not exist. However, in the reporting period just ended, it was all too clear that the emphasis was on reducing the consumption of future capital, and the most sparing companies were praised.
Major mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held first place in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also did the same — part because of compulsion and part because of fear of shareholder reaction.
So why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more revenue, as profits from other, more traditional fixed-profit investment products have decreased as central banks have unexpectedly lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors are forced into the capital market to look for profits, and they in turn put pressure on companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would rather have the money right away as more and more investors approach retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits was largely influenced by cost cuts in non-financial corporations and not growth in turnover.
Cases of leaking celebrity nude photos look like data snooping or hacking into an email account
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources say that an unknown hacker leaked videos onto the internet is puzzled by information security experts and Apple.
While a hacker has posted lists of female celebrities in one chatroom and said he has more photos of women, some of those photographed have reported that their images are fake while others have said that they were long-deleted images.
There are many filmings, including Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton, and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is which way the attack was made.
Were the photos and videos real and where did they come from?
The source for the images most featured in the news — a shameless and thorough attack on Apple’s iCloud service — is the most unlikely option.
Large companies like Apple have invested in in-house information security teams that are tasked with trying to infiltrate the company's own systems on a regular basis.
"A large-scale hack into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher claim that the claim is true," comments Rik Ferguson, vice president of Trend Micro's Information Security Research Unit.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks related to public figures (as well as the hacking of less famous people every day) is the leaking of an email address and password, either by guessing or by phishing information, i.e. by tricking a person into logging in with their information to a genuine looking site, and then using this information against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to backup photos when they are transferred to a cloud server.
A user’s account can be signed in to iCloud by entering their email address and password, after which their photos and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), i.e. additional protection against account intrusion, in which case a code is sent to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few people use the 2FA feature, either because it is not known, or because it is considered arduous.
Apple is still investigating whether all the data originated from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely users’ accounts were infiltrated.
The Company has not made a statement at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson thinks it is possible that the hacker has used the "Forgot password" link in Apple's iCloud service by first collecting the email addresses of public figures, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in multiple services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's images claims that the images are genuine, but does not say when they were taken.
Winstead said in a tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were deleted a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long it took to make a creepy effort.
I have sympathy for everyone else who has been hacked," he wrote in a tweet.
However, Graham Cluley, an independent security expert, points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed the photos from his mobile phone, but removing the image from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Today’s smartphones regularly store images in the cloud because they often do not have space for a large number of images taken by the user.
The standard setting for Apple's iPhone is to save photos to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones store photos to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automated image and data storage services.
"People take and delete pictures but don't understand that images are being uploaded from the account," Cluley told The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deleted does not always mean deleted," he states.
Images and videos can be stored for years.
If someone has access to a user's email address and password, they can re-download any photos and videos sent by email.
Images from Apple can be downloaded to your Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker posted a screenshot allegedly showing videos and images taken from Windows PC that have not yet been released.
Two-step authentication protects against such hacking because it requires anyone who attempts to copy an existing account to another device to enter the original user's device, usually a code sent to a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo offer two-step authentication for the account, but it is not yet known whether or how many of those public figures used the service.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be in are not authentic.
A spokesperson for Ariana Grande has said that the pictures that the Grande is allegedly in are "completely fake".
Victoria Justice wrote in a tweet: "I think the nude pictures that were taken are FAKE, don't you understand?
Let me break the roots of the rumors from the beginning.
Cluley brings up another option.
Because the hack was targeted by public figures, their accounts may have been hacked by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their email.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or a representative have any part in it," he wonders.
However, these public figures do not use a single publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of a security attack victim or helped configure it, and secretly changed the system so that all data can be recovered.
This was the case of Christopher Chaney of Florida, who received the nickname "Hollywood hacker", in which the hacker distributed photos from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012, and was also ordered to pay over $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly hacking into the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera in the name of this stylist for pictures of the star as a minor, and then posted the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions "were certainly one of the worst breaches of privacy you could imagine".
Chaney was also alleged to have been spying on two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, "In the case of Chaney, the stars' email accounts were hacked, and altered so that someone sent their information forward even after changing the password."
Cluley says that the obsessive activity of hackers hacking into these accounts "reminiscent of collecting butterflies."
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had come across a list of information and login details for these accounts on services like Dropbox.
Hackers may have also been trying to infiltrate for a long time.
or they had access to information from an email account, such as an address book, and then fished for other people's information.
I don't think it's a simple security hole for iCloud.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped in Syria by terrorists linked to al-Qaeda.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to be holding 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, a terrorist group that captured the crossing point in the Golan Heights last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday and their whereabouts are unknown.
In Samoa, ministers attending the United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are deeply concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australian assistance to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured that Australia will help the UN in everything it can do, including providing intelligence assistance," he told AAP news agency Samoa on Monday.
We maintain very close contact with all the partners and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position on the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, a group of Filipino peacekeepers held captive in their army barracks were reported to have escaped in different parts of the same disputed area.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan Heights since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
Scammers are trying to steal your money through carbon tax repeal initiative, Australian competition authority ACCC warns
Scammers are taking advantage of a carbon tax repeal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit of the Competition Authority has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on over-sounding offers from government agencies offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Scammers may use figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save on buying commodities after the carbon tax is lifted and offering him up to $7,000, the warning says.
Scammers may sound very convincing because they have discovered the victim's personal information that they are using to try to get their hands on bank details or to get the victim to pay the reward.
They discuss topical issues to trick the victim.
Scammers use more than just carbon tax scams to gain access to money. Their stories are more sophisticated than ever, and they take advantage of current issues to build a scam around them.
The missing plane on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired fraudsters.
The ACCC instructs you to contact the company using self-cleared contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or e-mail from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, that you are entitled to compensation for the repeal of the carbon tax, be on your guard.
If you believe you have been scammed and provided personal information or transferred money to a scammer’s account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it probably is.
Economic Messages: Lipponen criticises EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticizes the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in an interview with Taloussanomat.
Russia’s focus in politics is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions do not necessarily work,” Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started working as a liquidator for the business operations of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) in the Arctic regions.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended Russian project funding as part of the EU’s economic sanctions.
“This means, for example, that environmental projects in the Northern Dimension, with clear prospects, will go on ice,” Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding now hinders cooperation, which, according to Lipponen, can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that Finnish companies’ interest in cooperation projects in the Arctic Sea region will continue to be as strong as before.
He is currently working on a report for the EK on Finland’s Arctic policy and opportunities for companies in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, we are talking about decades," he says.
It is rare for a ringed seal to come into shallow water or near a settlement, says nature educator Vesa Heinonen from the Ostrobothnian Museum lecture centre.
On Sunday we saw a ringed seal swimming near the beach.
Heinonen says that the ringed seal has probably come to Suvilahti for food.
It's not messed up.
This means that there are fish in the area, Heinonen hints.
According to him, especially in spring and autumn, seals are seen on the Sundom Bridge, which arrive specifically after the fish.
The ringed seal is still not a common species in the Vaasa sea area.
We can see the seals in front of the villas, he continues.
Norps are found in the Bothnian Sea and the Archipelago Sea.
A South Australian court ruled that Robert Vallelonga, a pizza owner who was murdered, behaved aggressively and violently outside a nightclub.
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga.
A court hearing has revealed that Robert Vallelonga, the owner of the pizzeria, behaved aggressively towards both his partner and the security guard just minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
Lawyers in the lower court of Adelaide for the murder of Vallelonga requested the release of their client on bail because it was "clearly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been released, behind bars until the trial.
"Evidence suggests that the deceased behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
Then a melee began, resulting in the 40-year-old intoxicated man -- tore up the security shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, the death was caused by one stroke, which clearly indicates self-defense or the defense of another.
A 25-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at around 2:25 a.m. on May 4, with severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries at the Royal Adelaide Hospital early the next day. Friends and customers of the pizzeria were left to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors said there was no reason to act on the accused of manslaughter, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver "that he had put someone to sleep for a few days".
But the security camera footage now proves something else,” Shaw said.
"It confirms that the deceased behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
On our client's side, there is both an assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors objected to the man's release because only one of the three security guards who were present on the night of the crash had interfered with Vallelonga's behavior.
According to them, other security guards did not consider him threatening because "he was short", and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid a physical confrontation.
They said that a taxi driver who clearly saw the incident would also testify that Vallelonga was hit "strongly" and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man's arrest until the following week, when she would declare her decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - justified as a tradition - Foreign News - Ilta-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to postpone the start of widespread disapproving hunting around the world.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season started again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
The British newspaper The Guardian, for example, reports that there is much opposition to the hunt around the world.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay bay where mammals are slaughtered after being selected from among them the most suitable specimens to be transported to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also becomes food.
However, local authorities said the start of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
Knowledge of the practice spread around the world in 2009 with a documentary film titled The Cove on the subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, the yacht has been criticized not only by animal protectionists but also by diplomats.
Opponents argue that dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to pro-hunting groups, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
Defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was protested by protests in several countries.
Protesters in Tokyo say the yacht is damaging Japan's reputation around the world.
A demonstration was also held in front of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki on Monday.
Some NATO member states are uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the views are divided on whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics and it threatens to bring down European security," Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
NATO member states will meet this week, and the military alliance is due to announce its new contingency plan.
The central question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the Conventional Weapons Convention (TAE) signed in 1990.
In it, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on how they would deploy armed forces in the region between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
In practice, the agreement will prevent new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself suspended its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
In view of the strained situation in Ukraine, NATO is considering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"NATO's resources must be available in all NATO countries that need them," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the British Parliament's Security Committee, told the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest person to fly around the world
While other teenagers were learning to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest person to fly around the world — and even alone, according to CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A youth living in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries on five different continents.
On his way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star due to his record-breaking flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun".
Guthmiller did not have much to say to those who made such comments.
Of course, I had a lot of fun, but it also involved a lot of work, and I hope that with my record, I will inspire other people to go out into the world and do great things as well.
Guthmiller's interest in flying began at a young age, and at first he asked his parents to have dinner at the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on taking flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20, 20-minute visitation flight, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm would stop there.
No, he didn't.
Guthmiller made a deal with his parents shortly after, which would give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of having my own car.
In exchange, I could fly airplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a pilot's license and two years later he leased a single-plane Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT University took care of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours in the air also meant that he himself needed additional refueling —
Lots of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookie sticks altogether during a long flight.
Flying to the clouds was both awesome and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have weather radar to help him navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little above the plane and which ones reached 45,000 feet in height and tore the plane apart.
Guthmiller's aircraft was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The fuel level of the aircraft could not have been higher.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the hardest part of his trip.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the take-off phase is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
Despite the risks and even his fear of heights, however, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for computer training through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, and founded his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are reflected in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but let’s see how it goes.
Guthmiller is going to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchisee is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled as fans lined up for her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores across Canada after Canada's W-TV channel began airing The Cupcake Girls reality TV show in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchisee was not suitable for the job.
"My Franchise entrepreneur was sitting in his car and called me that 100 potential customers are standing in line outside the store ready to buy a cupcake and he can't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the process of selecting franchise partners, starting with emphasising leadership skills that correspond to the company's culture rather than baking skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has held about a hundred interviews for each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but the employees work in a completely different way in the work environment itself, so the whole process is quite difficult. This is why our training emphasizes, above all, the suitability of the company culture.
Finding the right franchisee is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organization, while a poorly suited manager can cause costly damage to a company.
“I used to think that finding a franchisee is like dating, but that’s not at all true, there’s a lot you can do during dating to get to know someone before you get married,” Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a binding contract is signed, a guarantee is obtained, and a new store is built.
Entering into a partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and a significant confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship between the franchisees resembles a strong marriage, as they share common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That’s why McLachlan believes that a franchisee should also be careful when choosing a future franchisee before embarking on such a long-term partnership.
“It’s the same idea as in relationships: if a date is rude already on a date, imagine what she’s like in a marriage?”
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contractor, and to pay attention to the slightest alarm signals from either side.
McLachlan adds that franchisee like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but those who are first-time franchisee need to be more careful when choosing first, most important partners.
On the other hand, new franchisors must determine, on the basis of a supposedly successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills a new franchisee needs when facing similar difficulties.
First-time franchisee companies can also ask for the assistance of a franchisee advisor to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time, there is a lot of help available to franchisees and entrepreneurs on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will become easier later, as franchisee givers learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchisees can give advice and help with the evaluation.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in creating the company and the franchise system," says Erik Church, Chief Operating Officer of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies such as 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn’t have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs need to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church, there are 216 franchisees representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a Toronto franchise partner for You Move Me.
Chruchi’s method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
“One of the confidence tests we use is to ask yourself, ‘Should I invite this person to my place for a weekend barbecue?’” he says.
"If the answer to that question is 'no', you probably don't want to spend much of your workday looking with them for solutions to big business challenges."
Church further points out that the O2E Brands company must largely thank its franchise structure for its success.
In a business organization, managers often see their own position as short-term and very formal to the lower management level of the relationship, while franchisee entrepreneurs enter into a partnership with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
“The Franchise partnership has many more advantages over the traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense,” he says.
It is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local Chief Operating Officer.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if managed well, it will produce better results.
Rail Delays Lower Grain Prices in the North of the United States
Delayed rail transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the northern central United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota provide farmers with only $2.7 per bushel — about a dollar less than control prices — primarily because of the cost of securing the rail capacity of oncoming rail traffic, traders and agricultural organizations say.
IN Raw materials
The problems are most acute on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company's BNSF railroads as well as the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to rely on railways to transport agricultural products because they are far from the river networks.
Delays in rail transport increased as the high harvest in 2013 was followed by a very cold winter, which caused trains to slow down and shorten.
Some farmers believe that increased transportation of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has displaced grain transport, which is not true, according to the railroad companies.
According to a director of an international grain trading company, the costs of grain storage and transfer vendors to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to as much as $2,000 to $3,000 per wagon per year.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs will be borne either by the farmer or by the customer," says the director of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that North Dakota's soybean crop will grow by more than a third and spring grain crops by 16%.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally, we are trying to start a new crop from a clean slate, i.e. enough storage space has been emptied for the crop and the grain has been sold and moved.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle this year’s harvest shipments smoothly.
John Miller, vice president responsible for the transportation of agricultural products for the BNSF company, said that the company has reduced the number of prolonged transports (train wagons ordered by customers, which have taken more than four days to deliver) from the peak in early April, to 16,500, to about two thousand.
"We've transferred almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to transfer," Miller says, referring to the grain left over from the previous crop.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF's grain trains were nine percent lower than in the second quarter of last year, a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "uneven" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of transportable products, such as grain congestion peaks.
The Canadian Pacific rail company, which was hit by another mishap, has 11 percent lower speeds than last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds in the early part of the year.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has told the Railway Supervisor (Surface Transportation Board) that changes to its train wagon ordering system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% in the coming harvest season.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on continuously improving the speed of trains as well as making efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more train wagons every week," said a spokesperson for the railway company.
Ukraine crisis could solve NATO 'identity crisis'
Leaders, diplomats and experts from major countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of the NATO mission in Afghanistan will mean an end to the importance of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident from the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, which will be attended by 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of world crises on the to-do list of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the withdrawal of Afghan troops, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, a union of 28 states is needed after Russia's re-invasion of Ukraine, a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, pledge more money for defense spending, and re-engage in defence cooperation.
In some ways, NATO should thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was somehow looking for its purpose -- and it was going through a rather significant identity crisis," said Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to come up with a common strategy to defeat the rapidly gaining popularity of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the president will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-fed collaborators to a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world in finding a strategy to defeat the extremist Islamists, having first stated directly that "we don't have a strategy."
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved when discussing Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main means of punishing what Ukraine called the Russian attack.
European Union officials discussed the issue over the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
U.S. officials pointed out that the states that Obama wants to be the main partners in the Islamist problem are not necessarily members of NATO.
The accumulation of problems could not be foreseen two years ago when the last NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, then-leader Robert M. Gates used his last speech in his capacity to say that the organization has almost reached a point of "common military insignificance".
U.S. officials continued to complain that other states failed to meet their financial targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence spending, but only four Member States - Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States - achieved this target last year.
Now White House officials say they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that there was a genuine desire for the company this time, with member states noticing the potential threats in their actual size.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the alliance's "defence pledges are more significant and more important than at any time since the end of the Cold War," said Charles Kupchan, Director General of the U.S. National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement among the 28 Member States.
President Obama will spend much of his trip strengthening his commitment to defense cooperation for the benefit of Russia’s troubled neighbours.
The President will begin his three-day visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been circulating its troops in Estonia since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly circulating in Estonia as a new contingency plan is launched this week.
The plan aims to shorten the time needed for NATO to respond to attacks on border states, officials said.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation signs.
The changes involve a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
Officials say the new plan does not exactly violate the agreement, but it could also be a semantic distinction, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to be made public before the official announcement.
NATO’s presence will likely be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin's effective "winter" - will he use it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace up his sleeve on Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
The West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine has tightened, Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has the trump card: winter is coming, and Ukraine’s main source of energy is Russia.
U.S. officials say Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), according to Geysar Gurbanov, a Harvard university-based researcher.
When winter comes to Ukraine in the next less than four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country devastated by the conflict, Ukrainians will freeze in their homes as the supply of gas from Russia dwindles.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war eventually.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on July 16 due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom reported that Ukraine's due debt for gas was already $5.3 billion by August 1 (about €4 billion).
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the upcoming winter as follows:
“I think no one is thinking about it anymore, except Russia,” Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to resolve the issue.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to replenish stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and preparation for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin’s comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow will be able to use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman of Japanese holding company Nomura pointed out last month that Russian talk about humanitarian intervention and planning for a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless Kiev starts paying the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Yatsenyuk said that Russia is planning to halt gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak later said the statements were false.
Russia will do everything in its power to deliver gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes
A Saudi court has upheld the 10-year prison sentence imposed on Raif Badawi, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement, in May.
The sentence includes an additional penalty of one thousand lashes and fines of one million riyals (about 200 000 euros).
The verdict was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that demeans Islam.
The ruling was announced Monday by AFP co-founder Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed and re-examined.
The verdict was also appealed in May, when its injustice was also pointed out by Amnesty International.
Madventures Riku Rantala’s childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one revolutionary human encounter”
Madventures has published a new book, The Explanation of the World: An Adventurer's Explanation of Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells about the most important human encounter in his life.
Writer, journalist, Madventures’ other party Riku Rantala is a busy man.
A new book has been published today, yesterday was a movie picnic at Kansalaistori and on Wednesday the second season of Yle Docventures begins.
He has been running from one place to another since morning.
From Maikkari's morning TV to taking the child to kindergarten and from there to a weekly meeting.
A face-to-face interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there's no time.
In the midst of all the haste, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff, have had time to stop and write the Book of the World, which, according to the book's cover text, is the adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything, huh?
Wow, a lot of promise.
The book explores several themes, such as what our future is, why one culture is doing worse than the other, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we have done over the years.
The book has experts from both professors and artists.
We were actively working on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've taken a pretty big piece of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
We need to know more about the world and think about the big questions, because that’s when we’ll be doing the best in the world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is good travel reading, but it is also intended to get people to discuss and share ideas at home.
It can even lead to action, Riku says.

One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the planet, we have to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can there be a change, Riku philosophizes.
Riku says that according to some studies, Western humanity has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, wealth has not increased our happiness.
From this we can conclude that when we have enough money and our basic needs are met, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
We want people to talk about what is enough.
Utilizing our natural resources will not be enough for much longer,” Riku says.
In your book, you will also consider the differences between cultures.
How is an Indian different from a Finnish?
People do not differ much from each other.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of community is much greater in India for good and bad.
When Western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Isolation from others can lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found the right balance between community and solitude, we would be pretty close to happiness,” Riku says.
Riku has met a lot of different people around the world.
What human encounter has best impressed his mind?
It takes place during my childhood when I was on my first trip abroad with my family.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father worked for the United Nations there.
I was 7 years old and my two younger siblings were with me.
My brother was just a baby.
We came home with a large moving car.
We were driving in a war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl my age was walking along the road carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big Mercedes bench with a Coke can in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age will understand the situation.
It was a life-changing experience that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Riku then "went to cabbage" that other people must be respected, even if they are significantly poorer or they do not have the same conditions for life as us.
At the time, Riku realized that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adulthood comes to the surface the people encountered in New Guinea.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, they don’t spend much money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
Surviving is really hard.
It made me think.
He wants to know if he wants to get a new book from his readers.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
To make people act from warm-hearted lovemaking to conversation or even a fistfight, Riku throws.
This is reported in the Kauhajoki newspaper.
The events started when the couple arrived by bus at the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi started, a man in the yard threw an object behind the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and hand and left the scene.
The stabber is a 170- to 175-inch tall stocky, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blonde pony-tailed woman near the scene.
He is expected to contact the police.
The police also ask for clues from anyone who may have made any observations about the events or persons involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday 27 August at 7:50 p.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the internet
According to an article published by the journal PLoS ONE, an international team of researchers has been the first to communicate the message directly from the mind to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the experimental arrangement, the electro-brain curve of the sender subject was monitored.
The sender was trained using the program to send bits by either thinking about the movement of the hand or foot.
Imagining the movement of the foot was interpreted as zero, and moving the hands to number one.
This information, encoded in bits, was sent through the web to the recipient co-person.
The receiver was induced by magnetic stimulation to detect a flash of light for each bit encoded as number one.
The receiver had been taught to interpret flashes as a message.
The researchers admit that this is still a field of research in its infancy, but believe computer-assisted telepathic communication will be routine for mankind in the near future.
Sanctions - Punkti - The future of rural areas
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action is followed by reaction, action by retaliation.
Experience shows that all sanctions only bite in the long run.
Iran was not able to negotiate its nuclear program until years later.
The South African government of racial oppression sat still for decades, although trade had been banned by UN resolutions.
Sanctions have also been applied against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export state-of-the-art electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has set barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time the timber was frozen was raw timber trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and the disappearance of Viola from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU wants to ban the import of vodka from Russia, it is a joke.
The Russians prefer to drink the vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The flow of gas from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not the drop in imports of cheese or the export of vodka.
The biggest problem is the constraints on the financial sector.
It will only affect in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It's gonna have to pay off old loans, but it's gonna be hard to get a new one.
Even though Russia has vast reserves of currency, they will not last forever.
Credit for Russian companies is dwindling and money is rising.
Banks are not able to finance everyone.
We need to print more money, or businesses will face payment problems.
Bankruptcies are bankruptcies in Russia, but Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernization of Russia will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would once again return to Russia and curl up inward.
An exceptional free wrestling event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a group of diplomats, followed international free wrestling matches held in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event, organized by Japanese lawyer Antonio Inoki, involved wrestlers from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, Taekwondo matches by local athletes were also seen.
According to Inoki, the aim of the event was to bring countries closer together through sport and promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians called for improved relations between North Korea and Japan.
Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea has promised to reopen the investigation.
North Korea last saw international free wrestling in 1995.
SOK will reduce the organisation of the consumer goods trade by approximately 110 people.
Employment negotiations started in June, when the reduction requirement was estimated to be no more than 130.
According to the company, overlapping functions have now been dismantled from its organisation and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK says that its actions seek clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the background is the structural change in trade, which has shaken the consumer goods trade in particular.
The result of S Group's commercial goods trade has been at a loss for some time.
The negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK's grocery trade, i.e. a total of approximately 530 people.
TURKU Sanomat: Some of the self-care medicines behind the counter
According to the newspaper, there are more medicines coming between prescription drugs and the ones that are taken off the shelf, which can be obtained without a prescription, but only after advice from a pharmacy employee.
According to the Finnish Pharmacy Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be covered by counselling.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and if the pre-defined criteria are met, the medicine should be given from behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, Chair of the Finnish Pharmacy Federation at Turun Sanomat.
In Finland, a few medicines are already available without a prescription, but they require advice.
One of these is emergency contraception.
Corruption for more specific reasons
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the lack of bribery cases and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the working group of the Ministry of Justice will consider whether sections of the Criminal Code on the trafficking and abuse of influence are needed.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the trial of the Slovenian branch of Patria’s bribery case in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
Trafficking in influence brought a two-year prison sentence in Slovenia for the former Prime Minister, but Finnish law does not know a similar crime title.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recently completed survey, corruption is hardly investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police College on the vulnerability to corruption in various fields.
Messi has a groin injury - Sports - Karjalainen
Argentine national football team captain Lionel Messi will miss Wednesday's national game against Germany.
Messi will keep the stand side groin injury, his club Barcelona told Monday.
Barcelona keeps Messi on the sidelines as a precaution.
Messi injured a groin in Sunday's league game against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he can fill in for Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are suspended in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witch pot in a FC Seoul match.
The Wanderers are in Dubai for a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi to prepare the team for the first semi-final match on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss the trip to Korea, but coach Popovic believes in their replacements.
"Of course this is a loss - they've been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic said.
Tomi Juric was suspended in China for this gesture.
After all, it’s a setback, none of the players should be absent, but we didn’t have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, he’s probably done a lot of work, and I have full confidence in the whole team.
I’m not afraid to play against anyone in the semi-finals.
The Wanderers are also forced to be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defender of The Socceroos was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in a return game at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back in his career and is recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already been practicing a couple of times outside, which is good.
It will take some time before he is completely fine, but he will recover well.
In Dubai, the Wanderers have access to world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic feels that the trip to Dubai is also a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after major changes at the end of last season.
"We know that this will certainly help players to create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both on and off the pitch.
We use the camp for many purposes.
An elite burger pays three times a worker’s monthly wage
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The Financial Times reports that the economy is torn apart by opposites.
In North Korea, the informal market is perhaps more booming than ever.
They offer wealthy or frugal ordinary citizens a luxury that is not used to being associated with a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: an entertainment centre where a mere ticket costs up to ten months for a regular worker.
There's burgers in this place that cost $76.
That's three to five months' salary for the country's regular workman.
In the pool, men drink beer in shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korea's "western market" began in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, although the prices of supplies can be outrageous at worst.
Still, in the capital Pyongyang, many have a mobile phone with a ovh of $200.
Part of the cause may lie in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
During his time, the administration has emphasized the importance of technology in the flourishing of the country.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopeful about sales
Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council purchased a 19th-century building in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, with the security and maintenance of the building coming to cost the Council around £400 a day.
The building was recently sold for £1.25 million.
The building will apparently be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified as "B" of historical value for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building is not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was purchased, it was put up for sale again at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party suggested that Ormiston House might be suitable for a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as soon as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate agent remain silent about the identity of the buyer and the selling price.
The weekly security and repair costs for Ormiston House are around £3,000.
The Council purchased the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board agency.
The security costs of Ormiston House by the beginning of this year totaled £885,641 and maintenance costs were £371,379.
The cost of professional services related to repair and maintenance was £250,015 and the fees for development and design professionals were £212,466.
The building was formerly owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887 when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, the Harland & Wolff company became the owner of the building and sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
‘Inequality grows’: Helsinki plans to cut school assistants
There will be no savings, says JHL.
A radical reduction in the number of school assistants is being prepared in Helsinki.
The reduction would not apply to the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Education Board decided to present a total of approximately 2.7 million qualifications for the resources of school assistants.
There are approximately 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the contractions are realized, they will take effect in the middle of the semester right at the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision will increase inequality.
More and more children need support to learn.
However, for reasons of savings, it is unfortunately easy to reduce the number of assistants because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There will certainly be no savings, on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff will increase.
Savings for schoolchildren pose an even greater risk of falling short of learning goals, and teachers’ coping is also hard, emphasises Päivi Niemi-Laine, Director of Division at JHL.
The plans of the City of Helsinki are making schools unequal, because with future resources, small schools and students in need of support will no longer receive any assistant resources at all.
The City of Helsinki’s goal is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, for the most part, the adaptation measures of the Education Agency are directed towards this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final decision on the resources will be made by the Helsinki City Council in the autumn, for whom I wish to have the vision and wisdom to look far into the future and act in accordance with their goals, Niemi-Laine says.
Israel invades the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the Etzion settlement near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, a sign of Israel's future significant construction in the region, and at the same time defies the Palestinians' request not to build more settlements and defies the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposes the expansion of West Bank settlements, felt that Sunday's events may have been the largest single land capture in the West Bank region in decades and could "dramatically change the situation in the region".
The aim of the Palestinians is to establish their own state for the lands that were conquered by Israel in 1967.
Israeli officials said the political stimulus to assess the land situation came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they hitchhiked in the area.
In July, Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main perpetrator of the kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the occupation of the land suggests that it was intended as a kind of reparation for the population of the settlement and as punishment for the Palestinians.
Located near the Jewish settlement of Gevaot in the settlement of Etzion in southern Jerusalem, the land has now been officially declared a "stateland" when it was formerly privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step for Israel to start planning buildings in the area if it wanted to.
However, Ahmad Lafi, mayor of the nearby Palestinian city of Surif, said that the land belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff issued orders early on Sunday announcing that Israel would take over lands containing olive and other trees in Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be submitted within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people prompted the Israeli army to carry out a retrieval in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, which Israel says was behind the abductions.
The ensuing tensions at the Israeli-Gaza border flared up into a 50-day war that ended last week with a ceasefire by Egypt.
The conquest of land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government which hamper the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Crises in Lapland are usually multiple problems
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are experiencing problems, according to a well-being study prepared by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing the tasks of municipalities by a billion euros is not enough.
Common features of crisis municipalities include weak local government finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkanen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and Eastern Lapland.
In the survey section, the residents assessed their municipality’s situation quite realistically.
In the survey, residents of well-performing municipalities were even pessimistic about the outlook.
High expectations have an impact on consumption.
People hope that today’s everyday life and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
At this time, people do not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a home, says Suikkanen.
The group of researchers was surprised by the large differences between the municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita ranges from a couple of tens to well over 100 euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita varies from more than two thousand euros in Ranua to 4400 euros in Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much central government transfers are received, and the degree of debt is much different in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close its borders to return Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily block the return of Islamist fighters to Iraq and Syria.
This is reported by the BBC in reference to government sources.
According to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way might be to increase the authority of the authorities so that they could temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, the UK raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor's immediate release from Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
A spokesman for Secretary of State Bob Carr said that "everything is going well" and the International Criminal Court's lawyer will be released into the custody of Australian authorities tonight, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today," a spokesman told the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support, the spokesperson said.
Taylor will probably fly to Rome before continuing his journey home to The Hague.
Taylor and three of his fellow criminal court attorneys were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintan on 7 June as they represented Seif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to Libyan officials, Taylor was taking papers to Seif that they felt were a threat to national security.
Senator Carr has gone to great lengths to free Taylor, including traveling to the Libyan capital of Tripoli last month to promote his cause.
Taylor had not been able to speak with her husband or little daughter until last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short phone call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with Taylor's parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release her daughter before her young child's third birthday in July.
The other three arrested criminal court lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr reported a week ago that as a result of a conversation between a lawyer released in The Hague and Libyan authorities, "the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any errors, but has promised to conduct a thorough investigation of the actions of its team after its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court has concluded its investigation, it will ensure that anyone who has acted wrongly will be properly convicted," the court said in a statement last month.
The International Criminal Court has called for the trial of 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May stating that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
New arrival saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took their second win in the early stages of the Spanish Football League, but easily Villarreal did not fall at home.
The blue-reds pushed their heads to Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjo until they finally succeeded in the 82nd minute.
The winning goal was scored by a surprising man: Sandro Ramirez, a 19-year-old who made his first appearance in La Liga, had entered the field just 12 minutes earlier.
A young man from Barcelona's second team invited to the representative crew finished close after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Messi's attempt.
Collections for Ferguson Police Mysteriously Ended After Over $433,000
The administrators shut down two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites raised over $400,000 to police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity site open to the general public, two separate pages bearing similar names — "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" — have raised $235,750 and $197,620 for the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site run by a Brown family lawyer had raised $314,099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and a demonstration against mostly black-populated Ferguson's near-white police force, forcing Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations attempt to decide whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have generated some controversy over Wilson's defense, especially after some visitors to the page had posted racist comments in the comment section, which have since been removed.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations around the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators gave no reason for this.
As the page visitor tries to give a donation, he sees a message saying "Donations are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
A spokesperson for GoFundMe on Sunday gave a statement to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organizer decides for himself when he wants to stop receiving donations," Kelsea Little, a spokesperson for GoFundMe, said in a statement.
Organizers can also continue to receive donations at a later date if they wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a revenue of $197,620, is maintained by a charity group of St. Louis police officers, Shield of Hope, a recipient of donations approved by GoFundMe.
Three police officers Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll, and Jeffrey Roorda, who were listed as official representatives on the Shield of Hope's State Collection Register, did not respond immediately on Sunday to emails requesting further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official spokesperson for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council nearby, and a member of the Roorda Missouri House of Representatives.
Also, The Times magazine was not able to immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Stand Up" page of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson", who has raised $235,750. He has not been confirmed as a recipient of donations approved by the site.
However, in a statement to The Times, a spokesperson for GoFundMe said there was an anonymous philanthropist.
Little information has been given to donors about the anonymous philanthropist of the collection campaign, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson page philanthropist wrote to site visitors two weeks ago a message that the page is collaborating with the Shield of Hope group to become officially accepted as a recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been granted.
The benefactor gave visitors wishing to learn more a pseudonymous Gmail email address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to a request for further information.
A spokesperson for the GoFundMe page said in a statement to The Times that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the search results on the main site and added that "the campaign in question no longer meets the requirements stated by the GoFundMe website to have a working Facebook account".
In GoFundMe’s information security policies, users are encouraged to “give only to GoFundMe users whom they know personally and whom they trust.”
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
According to Representative Little, however, GoFundMe "has been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to withhold all collected funds if it is necessary to initiate investigations in connection with any campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to withhold funds raised by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns in support of Wilson, told followers of the page over the weekend that lawyers are trying to find an "explanation" of why donors on GoFundMe have been blocked from donating, but the page did not provide any other additional information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and these comments have not been confirmed by an independent source.
Arsenal's top forward at the end of the year - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Arsenal’s French forward Olivier Giroud will probably be out by the end of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and it will take months to recover.
Giroud injured his leg this weekend in a Premier League game against Everton.
The cut went well, but he is on the sidelines until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or the beginning of January," Arsenal head coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's top scorer last season with 16 hits, so the loss is substantial.
According to Wenger, however, he may not get a patcher for Giroud anymore during his transfer window.
Wenger played a fresh acquisition at the top of Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday in the Champions League qualifying final against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez's goal.
Naked photos of Hollywood celebrities circulating online, suspected of hacking

According to the media, the images also included actress and model Jenny McCarthy, reality TV presenter Kim Kardashian, and singer and actress Avril Lavigne.
Actress and pop star Ariana Grande's spokeswoman said the photos of the woman are fake.
That's what singer Victoria Justice said.

Central Finland: Finns trust the safety of online banks
Most Finns trust the security of online banks, reports Keskisuomalainen.
According to a survey commissioned by the newspaper, four out of five think the security of online banks is good.
The age of the respondents is clearly visible in the answers.
Young people believe in the safety of online banks the most, and pensioners the least.
Tuula Sario, the leading lawyer of the Consumer Union, is not surprised by the views.
People who use the internet usually rely on their services the most.
Those who do not use the services are ignorant and suspicious, he thinks of the Middle Finn.
The majority of Finns are customers of an online bank.
Most people use computers, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more and more common.
A thousand Finns responded to Tietoykkönen Oy’s survey in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and the writer of the Silta series to work together on a crime series
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's best-known crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, a screenwriter of the popular Silta series, are working together on a new TV series.
The filming of the ten-part Advocate series is scheduled to begin next year.
Swedish production company Tre Vänner announced the project on Monday.
The series was purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Based in Stockholm, Advokaten tells the story of a young lawyer named Frank, who in one case finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
Lapidus, a crime writer who has become famous for his novel Money for Money, is a defence lawyer by civilian profession.
