Members of the Welsh Council of Representatives fear they will look like fools
Some members of the Council of Representatives are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP, i.e. Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The controversy originated with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Council of Representatives are concerned, regardless of party affiliation, that they may be ridiculed by change.
According to a Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to one Plaid party representative, the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but points out that there is a brief verbal leap from the MWP word to the word for fool.
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context similar to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Council of Representatives Commission, which is currently preparing the legislative change needed for the change of name, stated: "Of course, the final decision on the names of the members of the Council is up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Administration Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of the Council of Representatives as the Parliament of Wales enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured members of the Representative Council as members of the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviated WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
The members of the council apparently propose alternative titles, but the lack of consensus can cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to have a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the functioning of the Representative Council, such as the rules on the loss of office and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative process, members of the Council of Representatives may cast their final vote on the title by which they should be called.
Macedonians go to ballot box in referendum on changing country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North Neighbours is in practice a territorial claim for the territory it belongs to, and has repeatedly opposed its aspirations for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' clocks quiet as Harlem churches live in difficult times
"The elderly people I've talked to say that there used to be a bar or church on every street corner," says Adams.
"Today, there's neither."
He said the loss of the bars was understandable.
He said, "People's interaction has changed."
"Bars are no longer neighborhood shared living rooms where people meet regularly".
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced with residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Absolutely most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day when these churches will close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a neighborhood for blacks - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and the St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of blacks acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a black parish under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against merchants on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, over their opposition to hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building. When Father Johnson parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father of Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "the bell of the poor."
An expert who played the tower clock game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first tower clock game played by a black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
St. Martins has developed a complex tangle in recent months, partly involving architects and contractors hired by the lay leaders of the Church on the one hand, and by the Episcopal Diocese on the other.
The sacristy - an administrative body composed of lay leaders of the parish - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "seek to roll the cost" to the sacristy, although the sacristy had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel at first said he thought that the boy was just excited after catching the lobster, but then realized that he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reportedly critical.
The species of shark attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swam in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments served by expert advisors.
This is a major move in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty sector, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home goods sales. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are invested because supermarkets tend to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s says its range of beauty products will double with 3,000 products including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space, and will have their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique make-up range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers will demand it more and more often.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of grocery shopping to one-off small purchases in convenience stores will force supermarkets to invent new attractors for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food items.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores. The company says that this has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how profits from pharmacies in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows the acquisition of Sainsbury's to sell its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand portfolio meets all your needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "outraged" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11m deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home accessories and accessories brand, True.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" at last Tuesday's tense meeting held at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their home supplies and accessories brand, True.
The company has been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was bet to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everything in amazement.
No one could believe the events of Tuesday so close to publication.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
This Morning host is one of the UK’s most reliable stars, and his departure could cost the company a million dollars due to investments in products, from pillows to candles and clothing to home supplies, not to mention the delay in release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close for about ten years with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby arranged for Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as chairman in March.
The two are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked by M&S's new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "we don't comment on his business."
Tough talk, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his pro-North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said pretending to be the voice of a "news anchor".
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear weapons negotiations have collapsed.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said the United States would continue to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"North Korea is doing great," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have such an excellent relationship.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside with 10,000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroy island, hundreds dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's residents had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to Return, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Bureau, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to participate in aid work.
Indonesia remains sadly unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return likely lost lives due to a missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is challenging even in the best of conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship ordered to help victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new crash area.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's spent infrastructure development the focus of his election campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, either administration has been plagued by a funding deficit, while new elections are approaching next year.
Tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority in the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion, are also adding to the pressure.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sinks late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the major leagues on Saturday after painting in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal while his team was in a goal loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the rear post.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match at half time 1-0 after Belgian Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave base access to Mateo Kovacic in the situation, before rolling away near midfield and spurring Liverpool into the field half.
Kovacic played a quick wall pass in midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a great pass.
Hazard escaped the defence and passed Liverpool Alisson Becker with a left foot shot into the back corner.
Liverpool will face the Champions League in the group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Bureau reported early on Sunday that the earthquake and tsunami death toll rose to 832.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo, told a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six meters high.
Fragments of collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Palu, with a population of 380,000.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation."
A female police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman have come to the scene of the crime and have asked about where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they will try to inform the victim's loved ones about the incident.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had said no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it may take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s terrible.”
At two o’clock in the afternoon there were two beers in the isolated area, and outside there was an additional third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who supervised the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything will be asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously call Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 using code 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has also become part of a rewriting issue in history.
Deporting the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed cultural and religious memorabilia in England as did the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said, "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues would make a target for the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not command or implement the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The false Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is historical evidence of a figure that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph, "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, was caused by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th-century controversy has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell, on the other hand, is an identifiable figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as regent deserve praise and remembrance".
Chinese farmer killed by killer pig
Local media reports that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province. The man's artery had been broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig herder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door of a nearby pighouse was open.
In a pig, he said he saw a big boar with blood in his mouth.
According to the news, forensics confirmed the death of a 250-pound boar who was beaten by a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised".
A surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others as police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans before, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the wife managed to chase the animal away.
A farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that although pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can serve as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just need to be properly respected," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring extensive heavy rains to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa weakens as predicted as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa had wind speeds of 38 metres per second, a Category 1 hurricane, on Sunday morning at five o'clock on the east coast, and was located 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives in the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northwards towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain to parts of Mexico.
Thereafter, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rain areas southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 25-100 mm of rainfall causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimetres of precipitation per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Certain areas in the southwest, and Arizona in particular, are expected to receive up to 50-100 millimetres of rainfall.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal regions of southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainy season in the region.
Fragmented tropical showers begin approaching Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand over Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last throughout Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. can see overall strong fluctuations in temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the middle of the United States, we see an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer tends to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
Early October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures close to +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, temperatures could reach +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance of higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched a broadcast on Tuesday, broadcast by six television channels, in which Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sexual offense in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies suspended their broadcasts with a last-minute twist that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations based on an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping him and trying to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying that he was 100% certain that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers watching in offices.
Something of a scale indicates that the figure corresponds to the number of viewers of an American football playoff game or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all television companies, the largest number of viewers were on the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day's hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras described how protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to the Legal Affairs Committee hearing on Friday.
CNN showed live how he stood for minutes with his eyes down as the chimes flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he will tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to tell after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks aired directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began a vote to take Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by his talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Brexit Politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those critics of her EU withdrawal plans of politics that threaten Britain’s future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative party meeting in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls the proposal that Britain and the EU levy each other's import duties, "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteo Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at LSU, leading to his death.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a showdown between Sims and Simpson in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA on them, WAFB said.
Police say Simpson admitted to the Wayde shooting during interrogations.
His bail amount was set at US$350,000, according to the Advocate magazine.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's physical activity director, thanked law enforcement authorities for their "intelligence and execution of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that he was "horrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this going to happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexiko capital.
On Saturday, the Mexican Center for Disaster Prevention urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions had been recorded within 24 hours.
The centre registered rumbles and vibrations several times.
Images were posted on social media showing a thin layer of ash covering car windscreens in residential areas such as Xochimilco in the City of Mexico.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital after Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the resignation vote, which divided opinion.
Police held back a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark clouds of dust normally on the streets filled by tourists.
Over the course of the day, more skirmishes broke out as police officers used their batons to control the melees.
The clashes between pro-independence and Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter "Long live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain in the pro-independence region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low with those opposed to the divorce boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we're stuck," he says.
Despite the close but vital victory in the regional elections of last December, the momentum of the pro-independence parties in Catalonia has waned this year, with many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the holding of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides have fomented controversy.
"The situation is getting worse all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in custody since last nine years, announced that he would take part in next year's European elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the eroding of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have crashed repeatedly into a house in Londonderry.
Events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and building were damaged.

Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 with Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured the win
Series uplifter Livingston stunned the Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard only another loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to shared second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed their first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday they will face Series Leader Hearts, who are eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his undefeated streak in the series for six games. Head coach Holt has not yet lost once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost a place against a visitor who was suffering from a lack of blade
Holt's team should have led long before their goal after causing the Rangers serious difficulties with their frankness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide on the goal front to Craig Halkett's buffer pass, but steered past the ball.
The hosts favorably handed ball control over to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate on special occasions.
This is exactly how the important painting came to be.
The Rangers inflicted a free kick on Livingston, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga where he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but stated that the home team's defense would hold, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly could not be tried much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to repel.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow steered the ball past one more Livingston special situation.
The centers that rained down in Livingston's penalty area were constantly cleaned away, and two situations were also called for a penalty kick in vain - after Halkett tackled changeman Glenn Middleton and the ball that hit the hand.
"Great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to each player, continuing the up-and-coming season.
The team's style of play and crew have not changed much since its rise back to the highest tier.However, Holt must be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since arriving.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was staggering in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Wormall on their toes for the entire match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but now fell far short of his standard.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once. This should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the center cast of the league table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of repairing relations with NATO allies.
There have been disagreements over human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still many supporters gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the fore, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him into the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect a division of opinion, and some Turks in Germany greet him as a hero while others slander him as an autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist was killed when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwest part of Deptford near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street with busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and medical personnel came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a road escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks at the site and bus traffic has been redirected elsewhere. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards have been injured in the high-security class of men in the prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday British time and continues to continue.
Tornado special police officers have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest, with eight prisoners behind them in one prison wing.
Minor facial injuries to police officers were treated at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said, "The HMP Long Lartin prison has been sent by specially trained prison staff to look after the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October due to serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rains to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen early next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwest desert, bringing the risk of heavy rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure state within 300 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 50 miles [65 km] from the Arizona border".
The latest modeling by the National Hurricane Center predicts 50-100 mm of rainfall. On the Mogollin ridge in Arizona, in some places, it can rain up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are likely to be obtained.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in a drought-affected area if there is no risk of heavy rain.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rains can be beneficial because of severe drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first landed on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At the time, it is still hurricane strong with wind speeds of 135 km/h. It is moving north at 20 km/h.
The storm loses its strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strength during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"From the California Peninsula to northwest Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure on Tuesday morning hours. From there, she continues her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The biggest risks for Rosa or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfall and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in an area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reportedly in a "stable" state.
Police said they had arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are requesting contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh experienced Democratic party's "malice and anger"
"The vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and shameful methods," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the "malice and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford that would have occurred decades ago during their teenage years.
Ford also testified of his accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"The vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with outstanding merit in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-time," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats took on the task of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior aide to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process is expected to be in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Officials on Saturday reported at least 384 dead after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, many being wiped away by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on the shore of the town of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high hit the shore at dusk. Many were washed to death as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them as victims of it," said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's major disaster relief agency, BNPB, in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but pulled cars, tree trunks, houses, and struck everywhere on land," says Nugroho. He adds, adding that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in Friday's huge earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay could inflate the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that the bodies of some of the victims had been found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and that the damage may be greater from Palus 300 kilometres north on a continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communications are “completely broken and no information has been received about Donggala,” Nugroho said.
According to a statement issued by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building frantically shouts warnings about an impending tsunami for people on the street.
Just minutes later, a wall of water strikes the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the image material as well.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a large-scale power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities with transport planes, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief operations, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami killed more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
The Donggala staff of the World Vision have been safe in the city of Palu, where they have been housed in tent-cloth canopies in the courtyard of the office. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As relief teams began their inconsolable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made".
When the second night landed on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing people entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's hang glider team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, says Mandagi.
"As a senior member of the Pendant Slide, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he has been desperately trying to reach rivals in Palu who participated in the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hangover community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one gray sign appeared instead of two blue ones.
"It means, as I understand it, that messages could not be delivered," he says.
Thieves stole $26,750 in connection with ATM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26,750 from an employee of Brink's security while he was completing an ATM at Newport on the Levee, which is reported in a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had been emptying and replenishing the ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While the attention of Brink's employee was elsewhere, "a man ran behind him" who stole a bag of money meant to be delivered.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The character who used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album called Yanghi.
She replaces Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word also has religious meaning for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
Discussing the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
“I am you, we are all.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which only embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly about who we are.”
He is one of several well-known rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator JAY-Z has also occasionally removed and returned a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, President-elect of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student aid and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of access to education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI research
The US should double its spending on AI research as China becomes more efficient in its field, according to Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by notifications of AI by different parts of the US administration, although the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plans last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a publishing company that has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face+++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the top ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held executive positions at Microsoft Research as well as head of Google's China operations.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. administration technology competitions such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. researchers worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, but by big corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
"I think AI doctoral students should be automatically awarded green cards," he said.
China's Government's next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House has also announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA also announced an investment of $2 billion this month in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote to change country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a name change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's aspirations for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a territorial claim for its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek membership of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of eligible voters finally cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership .
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents erected by those boycotting the referendum in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like China and Russia, as part of Euro-related integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe a large majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said the "yes" vote was "our future."
An opinion poll published by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia on Monday referred to a voter turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - that is, below the required activity.
In a second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must exceed 50% by a single vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat the entire Brighton defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes seem ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by storming through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others behind at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot to the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet".
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
It did.
Fortunately, he scored in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the major league struggle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in the situation.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The sky blue forward poked the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim Champions League in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler in a match against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why try to force a starting lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to take over the pitch mound in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam.
The Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still aim for their first division win.
"Even though we don't have any input, at least we can go up to the pitching mound, knowing that the atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver creates the most demanding competitive setting I've faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take up the challenge?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a practice period on Thursday, playing his 34th game in the start and pitching on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA record is 2.53 and he has burned the batter to the base 300 times, with an innings record of 220 2/3.
Trump Campaigns in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I go around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump added: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They are determined to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don’t choose who they hurt or who they have to crush in order to get to power. That’s what they want, power and power, but we don’t give it to them.”
He said the Democrats took on the task of "opposing and preventing".
"And it's been visible over the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "hateful and mean and malicious and false."
When he referred by name to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the public responded with loud boos.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm waiting a little — it was really bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who express their opinions.
I was not really surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I am only the last Labour representative in the queue to be told that I am not welcome - just because we have our say.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated the same way just because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Labour meeting in Nottingham East stated on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a "friendlier and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not it is suitable for the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I shared a similar political view began to expect me to take a turn and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed to, whether it was about national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a surge of insults on social media calling for my election to be revoked, for central politics to be rejected, and for me to hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist abuse on a daily basis, and never falter.
Normalisation of abuse is one of the most disturbing aspects of the politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with each motion of censure or change of election rules, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I’ve been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that “everything goes well.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the neglect of the Thatcher government's single school, both as a city councillor and as a minister, I have been working to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at the tip of the block
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr unquestionably earned a win in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of 10 to have not lost a single game.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I can be happy," he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over by the Warriors to the match, allowed Melrose to take up, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before half time he scored and managed a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second period well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with a goal by Stafford McDowall, whose conversion kick Climo managed.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine, after heavy pressure, scored a goal whose conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored from the back of Ayr's maul who left the sideline throw.
Climo managed a conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and spurred Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.

Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named president of a licensed restaurant company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he is writing with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final of the series, and it appears that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he has been registered as Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the information, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": landlocked country Bolivia tries to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean by legal means
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flagpoles of public buildings fly with a blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon have been tarnished with the slogan: "Justly, the sea belongs to us.
Getting it back is our duty."
In Bolivia, which remained inland, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource war of the 19th century remains strong — as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades, with Bolivia awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, solidarity and serenity and, of course, a positive attitude towards waiting for a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are hopeful to follow the International Court of Justice's ruling from the big screens, hoping that in The Hague, after decades of intermittent debate, Bolivia's position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea will be advocated.
Bolivian charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday's lineup.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very near," he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
In addition, the ICJ has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is given just six months after the final statements are made suggests that the case "is not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity," said Zárate.
The rhetoric challenging Morales' dispute has smothered the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after that.
Neither country has had an embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never surrender its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move on from the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is resuming deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "distant dream" to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting the Declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon the arsenal of weapons, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security, has been met with widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show off the latest collection of large-sized headdresses, which will soon also be on your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their show of the SS19 collection a selection of unusual oversized headdresses that dazzled the styles of the Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical headdresses took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feathered loer, which almost completely covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Several colorful masks had their lips sewn, and were more like Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more like a diving instrument, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you’re in luck.
Followers of fashion predict that huge scarves are about to appear on the street.
The exaggerated-sized hats closely follow the "La Bomba", a half-meter-threaded straw hat seen in everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the impractical hat, which was heavily displayed on social media, also inspired another large creation to fashion shows —a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model that bears it.
The burnt orange reed-lined raffia bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the street view next summer — the designers have been so impressed that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of Scottish private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has continued also in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by Scotland's Council of Private Schools SCIS, seek to provide a high level of service to their students as well as their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, graduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an educational sector operator that can design and implement tailor-made study content, we have found that languages are a popular and desirable subject in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message goes to his or her heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with people in other countries.
From this year’s most recent test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of pass rate among private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data were collected from 74 SCIS schools and found that 72 percent of the students who received the highest grade in A studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent studied German, 69 percent studied French and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are held in the same esteem as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Employment Office, 17% of situations where employers had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more essential for promoting the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for potential jobs, the more essential these skills become in a global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he will have an advantage in the future over this lifelong skill, regardless of which career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey, 75% of over 4,000 British adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language known to a double-digit figure of 15%.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposedly important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and a high level of youth in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for supporters waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is soon over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in a game to be played before the start of the season.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the practice, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia Campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned election events for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote is pending his election to fill the Supreme Court Justice's vacant seat, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event will start at 7:00 p.m. on the east coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to take a stand on this week’s Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became ardent over sexual harassment charges that delayed the Senate confirmation vote as long as a week while the FBI is investigating the allegations.
But the primary goal for a series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tight November election.
Thus, the purpose of these five events of the following week, commented on by President Trump's campaign, is to "wake up volunteer and pro-Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign period," Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's venue is at the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can arrive at the venue even from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls," said political scientist Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting will to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon doubles were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-strengthening power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and more so in tournaments like this one.
Where is this success force, according to them, at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we take this success power as a touch," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot to be encouraged about, like Spieth and Justin Thomas' condition, which allowed them to play all day together and score three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior to brick on the green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory party intensified as his round progressed as he managed a critical put to equalize the match to exactly four as he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putt, with whom they won the 15th match, was followed by a similar scream, which gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and just worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The extraordinary but sweet duo of Europe has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo to make no bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this boisterous audience, confirms that they are Sunday's favourites. And when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, there couldn't be another more popular player to ensure a possible win in Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time.
However, talk of success in Europe is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated partnered Sergio Garcia with Alex Noren, who was the morning doubles hero.
One bog and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede so deep in the pit that they were nowhere near surviving from there.
On Sunday, no one will help you.
Four-ball and doubles are fascinating to watch from a close-up point of view: what kind of advice they give or fail to give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this doubles show that the United States team has the will to fight, even though it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe is in a good lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they took a 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and doubles from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning walk with two wins from the blinking Tiger Woods, and scored a score high to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who struggled hard to maintain two years ago in Hazeltine that they lost the win, dominated the poorly-playing U.S. team in the four-ball of the morning, taking the match to a 3-1 position.
The United States were a tougher opponent in the doubles, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to have won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively called "Molliwood", were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, they then finished superiorly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two games, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and doubles, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the doubles, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time prizewinner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They acquired a tough 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in the four-ball, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the doubles, however, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup the team has risen from a four-point chase position to levels at the start of the doubles, although a draw on the Furyk side is also sufficient to maintain the victory.
However, after two days of second best, it may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea 'not at all' disarms itself without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the test site for nuclear tests, and promising that North Korea will not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be maintained, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington does not approve of a phase-out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every sub-item, his statement must nevertheless be noted in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in a statement that Kim assured "the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for 'denuclearization first', and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even resisting the 'Declaration of Peace'," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, however, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added, "If the party requiring disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such an impasse."
Still, Ri's tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland was inevitable after the "evil president" Trump called Kim a "missile man with suicidal intentions".
As late as last year, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, but this year, Trump praised Kim abounding for his courage to approach arms abandonment, but stressed that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no temporal deadline: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia called on the UN Security Council to reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and not failing until we prove a full, definitive and confirmed abolition of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting funding channels for Pyongyang's production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met North Korea on the occasion of the UN General Assembly and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described progress as having been made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsteric demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and nuclear facility in a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes "similar measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means by "similar measures" the security guarantees that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting, and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take an instructional course on adequate rest
This year, all undergraduate students at Harvard University will take a course designed to increase student rest. The course is a counter-strike to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, the students of the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lecturing on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, my last year of college?'
No one had ever told her about the need for sleep, which I found surprising," she told the Telegraph in an interview.
The course, organized for the first time this year, guides students on how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine and vice president of health services at the university, says the university ended up organizing a course after hearing how students suffered from severe sleep deficits during the week of study.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have an immediate impact on students' behavior.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know about these issues in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Having adequate and high-quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' for students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state similar to starvation in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says that the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus to a comprehensive course for all students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students can complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to also remind them of bedtime time in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the "blue light" on the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot wins over Gerrard
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were picking up their first win since February 4-1 against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now experienced his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from Premier League current leader Hearts.
Menga shot the ball to the finish seven minutes before half time, and with Rangers' fallen will to fight, the situation was no longer leveled.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Instead, Livingston has climbed to third place, and only Hibernian is up in goal difference.
Rangers may have other problems ahead, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the gueststand hit the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up, with which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up with which the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again paid off as the well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score in just two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but fellow defender Alan Lithgow only managed to shoot wide into the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the final third of the game there was no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded a penalty after fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly repelled Lassana Coulibaly's buffer and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long pass tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
In exchange time, Gerrard decided to trade Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was cut short by Kelly's impressive rapid defense.
Livingston had the visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes after long.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers' exchange, also claimed a penalty shootout after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geiger Meter inventor
Next, a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Clocks", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play scientists who seem quite like cowboys, fits well:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on the minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really driving!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine able to teach immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves the isolation of resistant cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancers
The experimental vaccine has produced promising results in different cancer patients.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost their cancer cells within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and modifies them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers. The modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach —taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells —has also produced results in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got in the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live wearing a campaign hat.
The performance did not go as planned
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a brash manner and announcing that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
The broadcast of the evening began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's rant was not aired live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a fragment of it to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated for wearing a hat behind the scenes.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they still say I'm on the margins," West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says that he's wearing a Superman cape because "then you can't control what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments triggered boos from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the paper as: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative organization TPUSA, who praised her courage on Twitter: "Thank you for the bravery of the rosary."
Karen Hunter tweeted that West “is just who she is, which is just wonderful.”
I can, however, choose NOT to support a person (by buying their music or brand of clothing or supporting their “art”), which I consider to support and propagate an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us," he added.
The rapper announced before his evening appearance on Twitter that he had changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later an artist who used to be known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knifer charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys a sense that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times' cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" on the issue, and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, also a member of the Star Guard of the Game of Thrones, married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity raises strong feelings in me right now,” he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to the problems now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain kind to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
There’s something really wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be participating in the production of pre- or sequels to the Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer because he has, in his own words, "getted enough of the battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best the Game of Thrones has offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love for Harrington in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-affected citizens.
Health officials say the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator's information and accuses him of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied Saturday's allegations that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia website about them.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles asserted that the allegations were spread by "extremist right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published records are reported to have been the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Senator Mike Lee, representing Utah State, and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person released the information Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a hearing with the Senate Committee regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to the Hill newspaper, messages were posted from an IP address attached to Waters' office and by a Waters staff member.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations will not be held responsible in any way for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostilely.
There's no reason to be defiant.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
We need to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters' seat in the congressional midterm election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters stated that he had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies as a result of these fraudulent accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again with Underpowered Rowan Atkinson's Agent Parody
It is already a well-established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that is slightly tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit into the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which originated in 2003 on the Johnny English web and came to life again with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Born Again".
Can the tongue-on-cheek satire of a nation become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, Johnny English has earned his license to screw up for the second time. His name says above all that it is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, that idiotic secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe the melting glamour around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unfortunate one-note musician at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mystical world-man who left behind chaos and was originally portrayed by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene of Johnny English arriving in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades bump his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy come out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because 'serious' movie brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English's crazy treatment does not seem to me as inventive and shrewd as Atkinson's comedy of Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The starting point is that the UK is in trouble every year.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the field, to the dismay of an agent on duty — which is portrayed as a sadly small performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the pompous and troubled Prime Minister, who is already up to his ears in a swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson is doing everything in Teresa May parody's skin, but the script just doesn't offer him enough space.
When intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved out of active service must be called in.
Of course, Johnny English is a screw-up in his own person. He spends his retirement as a high school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The topic sparks some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons to the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he again meets his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to be able to reach her rights.
Thus, the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's secret service to confront Ophelia Bhuletova, a fateful supervillain played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough instantly turns into a farce: the two, disguised as waiters, set a fine French restaurant on fire and cause chaos while secretly pursuing Volta's luxury hunt. The attempt to explore Volta's house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the creators are lost when the final scene arrives, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little done for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same conclusion before: why isn’t the British film industry able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day work week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but pay would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to be demanding from business leaders that the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution be passed on to workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would ‘fit’ the party’s economic program and its plans to tilt politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source told the Sunday Times newspaper: "The line check should be announced before the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the move to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesperson states, "The four-day working week is not the party's policy, and the party is not considering moving on to one."
The shadow government's finance minister, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's labor conference to present his vision for an economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and "speculators" of utilities.
According to the Shadow Government Finance Minister's plans, current shareholders of water companies would not be able to regain their share in full because the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" based on perceived abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds that would allow 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to be transferred to employee management. According to the plan, an individual employee would be paid a maximum of £500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss 60 minutes on whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week the final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment as Supreme Court Justice. The delay also raises the question whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In an episode of the 60 Minutes broadcast on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing... I said I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up and asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut in stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know the following thing: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which takes place on Saturday in New York City, is a music event with a band of performers as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The 7th Global Citizen Festival not only attracts tens of thousands of people on the lawns of Central Park in New York City to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To qualify for a free ticket to an event (unless willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker or making a call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project's goals.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that we only have 12 years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘cliktivism’ among others — the illusion that you can change the world by signing an online address or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "deeds" made for various goals since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations that have already spent or raised more than $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to "helping children's development to its full potential". The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after activists had sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments in different countries, and global citizens just like you, we can pass social injustice and malnutrition on to the history magazines," Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the UK government was also urged to take action to improve nutrition for mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions section on the movement’s website is, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen's response: "The road is going to be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks lie ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the movement's New York concert this year, and its starguard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The U.S. Department of the Interior says the country may make it more difficult to export energy by using the Navy as a "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington can "ask" its fleet to help prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s actions in Syria, at the invitation of the legitimate government, are an excuse for a new energy market to be felt in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia's] presence in the Middle East is to transmit energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its fleet and, if necessary, by encircling to ensure that the energy they provide does not reach the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the audience of an event organized by the Energy Consumers' Union, a non-profit group profiled as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and the replacement of fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "circus number of one trick," with an economy based on fossil fuels.
The statement comes at a time when the Trump administration has been working to boost LNG exports to Europe and replace it with much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow's leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of the 110 billion cubic metres of the pipeline in use, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and sees it as an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country’s leading industrial federation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industries, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Senator from Massachusetts, plans to carefully consider" running for President in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she was "thinking carefully" about running for president after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and this also means a woman in the leadership position of the kingdom," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think carefully about running for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event by saying that "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren tweeted, “I think we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, according to an opinion poll released Thursday, a majority of Warren's voters are not in favour of this running for office in 2020.
According to a study conducted by the Department of Political Research at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support the senator's running for office.
32% were in favour of running for office.
More poll respondents supported former governor Deval Patrick running for 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates that emerged in the debates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election ceremony
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son will have to go through when he returns home, I can very well identify with other families facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers carry," he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma for Donald Trump's election ceremony.
Palin called the arrest 'a hippo in the living room' and said his son, like other war veterans, "will return home a little changed, they will return hardened, they will return wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla police, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and Columbia federal district support new asylum policy lawsuit
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to the new policy that came into force in the United States that asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and federal districts have filed a Friends of Justice letter Friday in Washington, D.C., supporting asylum seekers violating the policy, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says his partner "and his sons from a violent gang" assaulted him. U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorney general who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, much of which are from the United States, as states where gang violence and domestic violence are a problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision of the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the grounds of domestic violence.
In a statement Friday, Columbia Federal District Attorney General Karl Racine commented that the new policy "is ignoring state, federal, and international law for decades."
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the Friends of Justice letter states.
Prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of blocking asylum seekers' access is damaging to the U.S. economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring in the necessary additional workforce."
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges dealing with immigration issues to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is intended for persons fleeing their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social affiliation or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even the serious ones —that people face on a daily basis all over the world.
Desperate rescue of survivors continues in Palu, the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation is getting more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calms her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their ruined homes, pick up their watered-down belongings, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged in the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, intense aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how a raging earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and says that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
“I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “provoking” with “propaganda announcements”
The US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a tool for propaganda, a week after a Chinese newspaper had published a four-page advertisement in an American daily that praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to a paid attachment to the China Daily last Wednesday in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional election. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in U.S. elections, according to Reuters, marks a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently bogged down in an ever-escalating trade war in which both sides, in turn, impose customs duties on the other side's exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime Iowa State Governor, says Beijing did damage to U.S. labor, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press," wrote Branstad in an opinion paper published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious traditions of free speech and the press in the United States by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, on the other hand, dissenting opinions are only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers dodged an offer to publish" the article he wrote, but does not specify what the magazine is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind and defend Supreme Court justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh may cause a reaction, according to analysts, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding the case have been going big, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move ahead with the vote.
"These things can't be reversed," says Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesman for the National Reform Group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to advance in Kavanaugh's nomination, which occurred despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among insecure female voters and younger voters in the suburbs, aged 18-29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible reaction if Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court's candidate in which he made his allegations of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be questioned, it's about how Republicans have acted on the issue and how they have treated Ford," Guy Cecil, head of the Democrats-supporting Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony, with a meager majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony categorically or likely, while 35% say they absolutely believe or are likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushes the matter forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one others, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh harassed him drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed to him his genitalia at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet in response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is "to rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "personal data repository", i.e. POD.
It can include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to the type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt’s website. This will all be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models will be turned on their heads overnight."
"We will not ask for their consent."
In an article published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I'm extremely optimistic for the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The City Remembers the Hero Priest of World War I
The city celebrates the Church of England’s only Victoria Cross Medal-winning priest, who served as a soldier, 100 years after the events.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, for the events of the attack on the villages of Bellellise and Lehaucourt.
However, Vann died after the sniper was created four days later without ever learning of the highest British military honour he had received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat of his award-winning grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns."
Later he plunged into the front line and "showing the greatest bravery" led the troops to advance before his assaults alone to a field cannon.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper created on 4 October 1918 — just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve like, something that inspires respect."
Michael Vann He laid a wreath with his brother Dr James Vann after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added, "a great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero."
Friends of MMA waited all night for the Bellator 206 tournament, TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the whole event.
The event to be held in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main-series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show switched to Pipsa Pig to the great dismay of the viewers.
Some viewers were not exactly happy after staying up all night because of the match.
One MMA friend opened on Twitter, describing the replacement of the match with a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, the content in question was not suitable to be presented at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications for changing the program".
"Pipsa Pig, yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a rebroadcast that will probably make the show work," Coker said.
"However, it's six o'clock in the morning and we can't get the show out until Sunday for our time, which is Monday for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that as the program changed in their heads, messages began to flow one way or the other and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, trying to offer our fans more and trying too hard.
This is a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says she didn’t realize until she came to high school that “not everyone is the same as me.”
Daley, speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, said she talked about gay rights to give 'hope' to others.
He also explains how winning after having a child at the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a permanent host of the long-running radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less" than everyone else when she was young because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs".
“To this day, feeling less and different has been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I’ve needed to succeed.”
She says she wanted to show that she was ‘something’ so that she wouldn’t disappoint everyone when her sexuality was finally revealed.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he will appear at this year's Commonwealth Games to plead for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion recounts his fall in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "became a surprise".
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age" — he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find another person of his age who would have experienced similar fort and adversity," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — as a result of which Daley's "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of just 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about the tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games, he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he's not going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped. It was only after his breathing had really stopped and he was dead that I finally realized that he was not invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of all my life — jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first song selection on the air — Heather Small's song "Proud" — which evoked feelings already as he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson at Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make a substantial cut to avoid the record round going down in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays in a two-yearly event for the record 12th time, went on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome to be played on Saturday.
Usually the center of attention, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half a day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to gain control of his bat.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, not even considered to be one of the most accurate drivers of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course where a long-grown roughy punishes inaccurate punches.
If Mickelson doesn't have enough resistance in the field himself, the ninth game on Sunday will be played by well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to show up on a streak of all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind in 12 doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, squeezed me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He’s arguably one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it happened, and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, though it was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something unspecified to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy that everyone likes to be around," he explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week too. It's fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's extensive lead before the final day doubles can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side led by the Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who made it to the winner on the limestones by just barely the measure of his nose and won by the narrowest margin of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"It reminds itself of how we led briskly at Valderrama, we led briskly at Brookline, where we lost, but won at Valderrama, albeit scarcely," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-1 wins both Friday and yesterday, taking a 10-1 lead at Le Golf National.
“History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big calibre.
We go to the airport and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that award, and that is all we are aiming for.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who are playing for us, but we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at how his team's players have performed on a difficult field, Bjorn adds, "I never lick until I drop in on things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow, individual performances are the top priority, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re on the field alone, the player’s capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be passed on to the players - tomorrow everyone will be able to deliver the best performance.
Now you have to give up a partner who can go to the field alone and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced final day turnarounds in both directions. He was part of the team that won at Brookline before he ended up a loser when the European team won "by a miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered to the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed the ranks of his team to the try of the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like what happened at Brookline, or like what happened at Medinah.
When you move a thing in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our line-up accordingly and we will put the boys on the field as we please, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead a defensive battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to face their European opponents.
"I put the guys of the group in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament through," Bjorn commented on his doubles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German fleet's newest frigate should have been put into service in 2014. The purpose of the vessel is to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but it will be deployed at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesperson for Die Zeit, the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to available data, they are equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface vessels, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal perceptibility.
One of the most important features of the ship is its longer maintenance interval - new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without ever visiting the home port.
However, the constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to be designed to enhance Germany’s influence in the overseas territories, are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship since its delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in the German media about essential "software and equipment failures" that make a warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of Baden-Württemberg-class ships is around 120, which is only half the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's possibilities for subsequent upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz, with a capacity of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the equivalent class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price tag for the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning sum of EUR 3.1 billion, compared to the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have emerged as German naval power has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable vessels are "running out".
According to the authority, the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been decommissioned but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could have been deployed by the Navy.
Environmental Organization Eavesdrops on the Hidden Lives of Bats
A new study in an area in the Scottish Highlands seeks to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to guide in future conservation measures.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor bats, as well as earbugs and hydroponics in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organisation’s employees and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species in question are verified by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report are created in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's conservation adviser, hopes the results reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats, and how different species exploit them.
The information helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout Great Britain have declined considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and earthworks threaten bats' resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to nocturnal hunting practices, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization dedicated to protecting the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 notable gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only protected area dedicated to bat protection on the land of the Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bats.
David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very suitable for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before refurbishment, since the destruction of one bat resting place can unintentionally cause the deaths of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and are prohibited from killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the bat conservation organization, encourages the public to participate in conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't yet know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the allegations of rape against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram livecast to his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer sharply rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called "ineligible reporting of privacy concerns," according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for "mental sufferings according to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious personal rights violation in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into the player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to papers filed with the Clark County Regional Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said he was "99% good guy", but that "one percent" disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and took photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up with a settlement because he was "horrified by the possibility of revenge" and concerned "being subjected to public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to a contract to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will regret' car production
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Trade Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" with the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production in Burnaston at its factory near Derby if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
Japanese automaker says the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit ends without a deal.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU suddenly at the end of March, there will be interruptions in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Burnaston, Toyota.
Other UK-based car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern concerns supply chain risks, according to car manufacturers, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are manufactured on request.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
A 24-hour warehouse at the Derbyshire plant will be impossible to maintain and production will be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that not only means success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only the statements of Toyota, but also those of other manufacturers, show that we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning series of supply chains to date."
Toyota does not know how long production will be stopped, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union official at the factory, says concern is growing among members: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesperson says, "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "have to postpone another week" around Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to a rowdy controversy, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the elections, Trump's assistants' links with Russia, and any actions the president may take to obstruct justice.
For months, there have been rumours in Washington that Trump was going to fire the Assistant Attorney General, which would compromise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of firing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reported to be Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday program.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "There is no set date for this. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than distaste for the "attention-seeking" of TV reporters, but noted, however, "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more questioning hours than any president before him," he says, and yet more evidence to quote: "We've checked those numbers."
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it will be infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We often try to act in this way and you have seen us act in this way several times over the past few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open-ended events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have pointed out the reason for this by appearing uninhibited and at times strangely to the journalists gathered at the scene.
The Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries in the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) regarding fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to Scottish health care workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for their stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for "established status" of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal withdrawal.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reported Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him aside for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/extent of the injury is unknown at this point", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and plays his first season on the team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party's new plans.
The amendment aims to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
An increase in the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today a higher stamp tax rate from foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of high incomes.
An increase in the stamp tax will target people and businesses who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this will be directed to government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee — which is added to the current stamp tax in addition to the second and investment housing increases added two years ago — can be up to 3%.
The finance minister expects the increase to generate up to £120 million annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the home-ownership market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK — especially its capital — have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first-time homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to remedy Britain's "disgraceful situation of housing".
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and an end to "productive evictions".
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says, "I said last year that I was going to dedicate the British dream of my prime minister — that every generation's life should be better than its predecessors — to restoring.
This means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team'
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge to lift the team that is home to the northeastern corner of the country back to its feet.
Ross moved to the "stadion of lights" this summer after he had redirected St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team and that was it," Ross told the BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as a club manager".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic leader says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his renowned predecessors in a well-known club. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I'm measuring my own success with whether I can return this club to the major leagues.
Based on the club's structure and ability, it is undoubtedly part of the major league," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably only consider myself successful if I managed to pilot the team back into the major leagues."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as assistant manager of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coach group.
He then helped Alloa emerge from series three fall games and elevated St Mirren from falling condition to champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at an actual crossroads with my career," he recalls a time when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a decent amount of money and got to enjoy some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to do a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and work pressure, but managing a team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heat wave of the summer has given a boost to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% during July, but the revenue of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July became like June with pub sales 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
The 1.8% decrease in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than those running restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out with drinking in mind.
Sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, with food sales falling by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hotel restaurant consulting firm, says: “The results continue a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sales of the out-of-home dining market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in annual sales is particularly painful at a time when the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the milder temperatures in August bring the industry’s much-needed respite.
The combined total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following the sales of the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which compiles and analyses results from 47 industry-based groups with combined turnover of over £9 billion and is considered to be a reliable indicator of the industry.

A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of a rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing photos.
The news has increased fears that sexually explicit content can be posted on the accounts.
20% of students said they kept a cleaned ‘main account’ to show to parents while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped, after colliding with a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 kept two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle on 'Athletes' Voice for Scottish Athletes' Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board and attends the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. Ian Beattie, Chairman of the Board, describes the name as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the athlete's extensive, international experience accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidh is tremendously respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to playing my role as the mouthpiece for athletes and hope that I can be useful and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction."
The four Olympic gold medal-winning American athlete, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres distances at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient circulatory disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if I recover and what condition I am in.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training my agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
An ad that equates mothers to cows shares opinions online
An advertisement similar to dairy cows from a breast-pump company’s nursing mothers has divided opinions on the Internet.
Consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump" and its marketing is boosted by a tongue-on-cheek advertisement that reflects the style of music videos, which describes the freedom offered to nursing mothers by the new pump.
The four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn, including the following words in the song: "Yes, I milk myself, but the tail is not visible" and "If you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're tits".
The chorus continues, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has sparked a mixed reaction among viewers. Many say it makes fun of the daily ‘horrors’ of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after delivery," one commenter wrote.

Another viewer commented, "Understandingly, it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?"
The third commentator added, "A perfectly reality-compulsive advertisement."
I also got an ad: a woman admitted that she thought the ad was "funny".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," read one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and 'feel like cows.'
The advertisement is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced discreet pumps stuffed in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvis pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and fits discreetly inside the breastfeeding vest, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother’s advertising agency, commented on the controversy: “The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By juxtaposing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump to the spotlight, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought by the new pump in an entertaining and recognizable way."
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on a catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to Texas border tent camp in silence
The number of migrant children arrested has increased sharply, despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the crude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult for children to be placed in foster families.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as foster families can endanger their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective foster families and other adult members of the household must provide their fingerprints, and that this information will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs officer, testified in Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied as foster families for minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to look for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal with children’s cases more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules that, in some cases, have to be heard in court within one month of their arrest instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place.
Many prefer to appear through videoconferences rather than in person in the case of an immigrant court.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to reports released by reception center employees and the system in recent months, time spent in captivity for children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's desperation may go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish 'occupier forces' to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is at war for the eighth year.
Mouleem, who also serves as a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were in the country illegally using the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be acted upon accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Mouleem claimed the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the holy struggle until the whole of Syria is cleared" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a section of more than 1,000 soldiers to the ground torn by the fighting.
On the refugee issue, Mouleem said the conditions were good for the return and accused "some Westerners" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebel's last base in Idlib has created an opportunity to drive political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the region, which is home to three million people.
However, Mouleem has stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-associated al-Nusra front, "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a committee of new government and opposition members to create a post-war draft Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mouleem laid down conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interfering.
Why Trump Will Be Elected for a Second Term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic decision of the presidency ever made!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in spectators.
Since 2014, best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its top rating compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: a peak of 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a flare that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," ABC's Designated Survivor program lead producer Neal Baer says of a minister who will become president after the attack destroyed the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether members of immigrant families get to each other, and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of an informed citizen to look at the sixth hour of an expert panel debating the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, "a puffy garment of arrogance"), and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' unvarnished descriptions of President Trump's anatomy.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario again.
"What he's doing feels like a reality show because, in part, it's about giving something to the public every night," states Wheelhouse Entertainment director and creator of the pawn shop series Brent Montgomery Trump's show about changing characters and daily changing plot twists (an NFL dispute, praise from Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, his place on the north coast of Kauai was a wonderful sunny day, but he couldn't go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and was at stake for the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money is flowing from the outside for a tough midterm election fight
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has faced a real flow of money, as due to the reorganization of congressional electoral districts, two already elected candidates will have to fight for one seat.
This newly redefined Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained his seat from the second constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is in competition with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-done after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has sparked an economic struggle in the main party finance departments in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the March special election of the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District, which was widely followed in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by the Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won in the area by 20%.
Political commentators have given Democrats a head start.
U.S. plans to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backs down
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the slight reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership team.
Officials from the U.S. Department of State decided to recall American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of quiet policies that no longer recognize Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit the Central American state with a high unemployment and homicide rate.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting the previous year was seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior administrators made it clear that the meeting was wanted to proceed and this effectively ended speculations about a possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the meeting scheduled for mid-October some kind of signal of the importance the administration attaches to the assembly, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of an anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now highly weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reportedly directed an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents, and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs and I do not mean to say that the defeat of President Trump would be inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the ensuing years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump dismisses Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation into the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled since the news came out that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the president's possible inability to carry out his mission.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?"
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will go through a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light sabbatical candles on that swastika-decorated table.
How can I be anything but optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic for Rapid Vienna
Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday knowing that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month, a win over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal has a good resistance," the 31-year-old player states.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got going in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the European League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this team we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was really tough when it comes to my injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
Hopefully we can now push it to its fullest, put the past season behind us and succeed."
Fear of Retirement Savings Takes Women from Night Sleep
Although the study participants had a clear view of how they hoped to be taken care of, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had spoken with their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the topic up," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them in time.
Talk to a professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important cost determining factor.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-funded insurance, if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on site so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of your financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember, too, the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write this information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just about the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
“What medications are being used?
Who takes care of the dog?
“Keep the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe

The victim, about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police described the attack at around 2:30 a.m. as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life threatening and police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia on Friday, officials say the death toll is expected to increase.
As communications to the area are cut off, rescue authorities have not received any information north of Palu from the Donggala Municipality area, which is closer to the surface center of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palus and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the island of Sulawesi along the northwestern coastal line.
Donggala Municipality is an administrative district under the province with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, and in particular the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Sumatra Mentawai Islands, causing a ten-meter high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remember the massive damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of a former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to an Alaskan police report on Saturday, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and preventing and resisting domestic violence reports at the time of arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone from her date when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial and has been bailed out for $500, according to TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and responded that he was "guaranteedly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B violation, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
Palin has not been charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a gun under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications connections are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the eight terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of New York City, a rare sentence that has not been enforced in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway bikeway in the south of Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report relating to the application for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including charges of eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this title in cases related to organized crime. In addition, charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation," prosecutors stated and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as "terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliji, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the indictment statement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the death sentence was passed by a court in the southern district of New York.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is an Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that what he did felt good, police said.
According to the charge, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He pleaded guilty to 22 counts of innocence.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma that these events cause to the parties involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be demanded the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised in a protest against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
Former UKip leader said politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead talks with the EU.
Conservative line representative Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that the UK "would already be out" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge between her deeply divided ranks as she reconciles, underscored by conservatives in favour of staying, who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the surface under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as from the EU.
Supporters called on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leaven event in Solihull that he wanted to "throw the Chequers proposal away".
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I am in favour of Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight World Wars to end up as subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is a completely false claim."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters, "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who are actually taking to the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Drop the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added, "Prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs while they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to reverse a decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to reverse Brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is an independent, self-governing and proud state again."
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was formed this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in order and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and the smooth border functions for free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
“There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, faces Republican Geoff Diehl in a re-election in November, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump's term.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now is the time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest seat."

Louisiana's Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that they had arrested a person suspected of shooting LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims that led to his death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who appeared in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday via 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during interrogations that he was present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when arrested and was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 98-cent junior who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own fate as he defended his place in the first two rounds, calling Vettel on his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive the crowd on the tails, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes visited the pit later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton moved past after a little contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up defending his position after only his two third turn move.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge for much of the race while prolonging the tyre change with the aim of a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps as Räikkönen took fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job achieving a double win," Hamilton stated.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment at a speech on Saturday.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was evidence of people's "malice, malice, and dishonesty".
"That one possible thing, that wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, mean, and dishonest," the president said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document -- oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we...no, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing allegations about Ford's Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban did not stand for the president, who commented on the matter at Saturday's ceremony: "I'll tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought Democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They've decided to get back into power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and malice, they don't care who they hurt or over whom they have to walk to get to power and rule," Mediaite reported the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed credit for the defeat of Friday's Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to levels, before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard leveled for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who won as underdogs to Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute in 3:35 from a pass by Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the frenzied opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in 13:10, before Matt Marquardt pitched the Cownie handicap goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first period break as he hit his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team put their ranks together and Bouchard levelled again with a power play goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen scored the first lead for Dundee at the end of the second period. He also secured the victory with his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will be next at home to Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller killed while making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller has become a hero after his death as he ensures that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers made it into the air safely.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami caused by it hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks hit the area and several people have been trapped among the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled at the cost of their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in a wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained stationary and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was able to fly safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, an Australian ABC News broadcast reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter got back.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll will rise to thousands because disaster officials in the country have reported that connections to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
"The death toll is still believed to be rising because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: #Ambulances are bringing bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what is waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may turn out to be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
“Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airliner of an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now say one person is missing, although earlier reports say all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane had struck water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in waist-deep water to emergency exits.
He reported that the passenger staff had panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on repairs at a nearby dock were involved in rescue work by transporting people to shore in a rubber boat before the aircraft sank into water about 30 metres (100 ft) deep.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded a retrial in which he was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the information stored on his mobile phone to compile the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was contrary to his earlier claims in Chambers' company the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the data stored on their mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The closing arguments for the defence are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to the Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to hip hop roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a new rise in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New York nurse sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and found out that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, DARK AGAIN," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Then, however, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, annoyed, had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that their previous African-American nanny, who had received departure passports, had performed her job poorly and had this time been expecting a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and wants $350 a day for the six months he had originally been hired to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist allegations, saying that ending Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after offending him.
“My wife sent him something he wasn’t supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in an interview with Posti.
"But would you leave your child with someone you've been unkind to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge to blackmail and said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to start chasing someone in a situation like this?
It's not very comfortable," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing off their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book's approval, says of the letter: "It is difficult to empathize with the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books felt bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington was "described as a very important family member" and stated that his father was silently proud of the success it achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not at all a swaggery type," the daughter says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement for him; something you're proud of, even if it's not really your own.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called all the time and said that the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter was going to die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that doctors used to keep her heart running gradually left her body.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane among the other passengers - who knew nothing of the ordeal he was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number for support.
Davis' son Tyler contracted depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a catchy grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lights up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't tell me he was depressed or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was right on the ground on Christmas day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He states that Mark's death was a severe trauma to them, but they still have to make it through: "It breaks the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could really get what he wanted - a study limited in time and scope - we might be able to achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "break up" into a dead end caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want an FBI investigation?
Reluctantness is about timing.
The midterm election is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans' success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court will be made more difficult.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to lobby them to give his support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
The Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game over and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors drop in Kim’s time
South Korean lawmakers say the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification and reported that the defections occurred last year 1,127 - in 2011 there were 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
The majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often returns them by force.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on stalled negotiations on the dismantling of nuclear armaments.
This followed the June historic meeting at which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and generally agreed on an effort towards non-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the U.S. of stalling sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will by no means begin to unilaterally dismantle our armaments first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi stated of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotional and at times almost screamed and lost the ability to speak when telling about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic members of the committee without calling the accusations against himself "grotesque and planned persecution of the person" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he is not capable of acting on the Supreme Court because it showed him to be biased towards Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when he was asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, including the court he's currently working on," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh currently works for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we would be expected to find that it's wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with everything.
It’s a legitimate fire speech with months and years of rage going on, and he can’t keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's anything unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "I was helped tremendously by a woman who was in a leading position in something and who told me that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her talker in a situation where she got angry and started crying: 'You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a route of venting rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when once I cried unspoken with rage and an older woman — a cold-striped supervisor I had always been a little afraid of — grabbed me by the neck and pulled me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and then they'll be happy because they made you feel bad."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught having an extramarital affair in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business and was forced out of the race, highly frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least needed was just one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
Since the campaign was long gone, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” he thought.
When he made his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he came under the influence of his feelings — gratitude for his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work against voters and not delegates, and hatred for sexism — that he was unable to speak.
"You might have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be beaten as an obituary
“He was crying.”
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The launch of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a breakup between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's major export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with the same amount every time, most recently imposing five to ten percent tariffs on U.S. imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-for-an-eye fashion, and it does not appear that the world's second-largest economic power is losing ground for a moment.
In order to make Washington retreat, one should give in to one's own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing interdependency between countries.
“A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will trigger an economic downward spiral in either country, and this is in fact a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have realized up to now,” said Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
Syrian foreign minister says country 'ready' to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team by 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown for themselves when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had difficulties almost throughout the tournament and hit his starting punch in the water on the 16-hole of the par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari of Italy shone in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was out with 5&4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Sergio Garcia from Spain, became the tournament's most winning European ever with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this win.
It's a team and I'm glad I was able to help," said the moved Garcia after the European team won.
She passes the torch to her compatriot Jon Rahmi, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions played on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride after beating Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose play was of a high standard throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk stated his troops failed after the performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to take my hat off.
We met our winners."
Situation of red tide algal bloom: concentrations falling in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, algae levels show a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more scattered algal areas are reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide algal bloom extends along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be observed ten miles off the Hillsborough County coast, but there are fewer of them than last week.
Red tide algae blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high levels on the coasts of Hillsborough County, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota counties, background concentrations to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and background concentrations to high concentrations on the coasts of Lee County and Collier County had low pitches.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
During the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
