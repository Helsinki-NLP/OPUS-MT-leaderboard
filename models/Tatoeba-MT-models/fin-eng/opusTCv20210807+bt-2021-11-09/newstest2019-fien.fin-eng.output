Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home win in opening - Savo Volley wins second win
As many as seven times in a row, Hurricane-Loimaa, who was medaled in the Men's Volleyball Championship League, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, an all-rounder who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective in the Hurricane by 22 points.
There were some tunings for abroad, but they didn't come true, and then came a call from Loimaa.
We were able to get things done quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective among the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team chipper playing on a match-specific contract with 17 points.
Winning an opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extras to the game.
Our game is not yet finished, but the continuation of the medal streak is of course the goal,” Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley 's
Miro Määttänen was the most effective Savo Volley with 18 points when the team defeated the Vantaan Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially in the attack head, but fortunately we managed to squeeze the win.
I didn’t have any consciously different charge when I was playing against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball 3-series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
The head coach, Jukka Tuovinen, was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, meaning the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
I missed a good home opening.
Miro was king, Silliki played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden Sammo while Tuovinen was then also the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks most effective with 14 points.
Mikkonen once again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league's scoring in the 2012-13 season, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after taking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
We lost today, as we were in the fourth round 17-21.
A win was mined somewhere, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most effective in the finals was the 28-point chipper Edvarts Buivids.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
I didn’t get much of a kick out of this guy, Michael.
Finland ranked number one in the world in the comparison of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in the comparison of human capital, says the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst.
When measuring human capital, the population’s level of education, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois stretched to the top fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico of Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois was able to fight off.
Courtois played three seasons on loan for Atletico while being a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, he was selected as the goalkeeper of the year by the International Football Federation FIFA.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best finish, but his shot was headed past the goal at the end of the opening half.
Bale missed a break after the exchange due to a femoral injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goal cannon who moved to Juventus in the match.
In the United States, abortion rights are now under attack - a powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary 'Reversing Roe' - The United States and abortion rights tell how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received various degrees of support from the majority of Finnish MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is found to be the only doctor to perform abortions in the state of Missouri.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending religious freedom in the United States.
The news videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
It was a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of a self-abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths per year in the United States.
The legalization of abortions was supported by the Republican Party.
In 1967, California’s abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his 1980 presidential campaign, who began to revolutionize religion into politics in order to capture voters.
Abortion was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
At the heart of the issue is the search for the root cause of the politicization of abortion.
When religious organizations in favor of racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as a cane horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
At the time of this writing, the U.S. is in a situation where Kavanaugh, who has boasted of his sexual harassment but who has captured the voices of the religious right with his abortion stance, has been nominated to the Supreme Court by the President, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh has the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children at the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun using force to prevent protesters from breaking down the border fence or seeking to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12,000 people were injured.
Protesters demanded that Palestinian families have access to the territories from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped on kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - he didn't get to shoot himself
Wigan's top pick Chey Dunkley appeared to have knocked him down by a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
The referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Santa could not believe his eyes.
I think the situation was troubled by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty point, and Mario Vrancic batted a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
The work was good for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the day.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 people experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women have at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, people sexually interested in children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Foundation for Criminal Welfare and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood began at Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are expected to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
The majority of those who consider paedophile feelings themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus have not committed any criminal activity.
However, preference is usually a permanent trait.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life,” says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist who works as a specialist in the project.
“I think the work is valuable if one child is spared from sexual violence,” Thesleff said.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the award based on betting odds.
Trump’s role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at speech level.
The most popular peace prize winners are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between the two countries.
Warming between the two Koreas is significant, as it was still icy last year.
Yet the reward of Kim, who has been threatening with nuclear weapons for years and with an iron grip on his country, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced on Monday, and on Friday will be the highest-grossing Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to participants in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become a leading expert in the field in the world.
Through his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a terrible by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been the UN refugee agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 nominees this year.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
“Everyone thinks so, but I would never say so,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
“The prize I want is a victory for the whole world,” the president said, referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are factors that make Trump’s Nobel improbable.
The award-winning Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and the multipolar world order - the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the award has been won by three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
To reward Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire notice in tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos that occurred on Route 1 in Lohja took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it was discovered that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are drivers on the road who are in shock and they are driving as they wish, Pasi Kääriäinen, the on-call fire manager, told STT at the time.
At the time, the highway was even headed in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Communications Manager at Liikenneturva.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels are not allowed to stop except for compelling reasons.
Liikenneturva reminds us that in exceptional situations you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall at all times provide for the most unobstructed passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on a motorway is particularly prohibited, as is making and cancelling a U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” Heiskanen says in a press release from Liikenneturva.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their celebrations even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s master at the time.
M/S Tampere, who was on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off his route late Saturday night and got stuck with his bow at the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard the ship were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the accident.
The lynx fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and take the bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s event was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log residues, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant impact
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumunensalmi shortly after the ferry route had passed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama involved in the case, as the ship's speed was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more notable collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or depressions on the ship, and the ship’s cruises are expected to continue as usual.
The diver visited Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship began to be towed off the shallow.
As a precaution, we will go to the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused,” Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise of M/S Tampere, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
Rescue services received an alert on Saturday night shortly after 7:30 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Firefighter Matti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three on the night of Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
Built in 1957, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s judge candidate accused of bullying and drinking may be missing a top position
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well be out of office,” said Program Director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up posing as someone else in office.
In the United States, it has occasionally occurred in the past that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court justice has caused a lot of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
The president was able to keep his face.
Nomination would rain on Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but, at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely fall to the Democratic Party in the upcoming congressional midterm elections.
It would stimulate voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
There is no chance for an appointment for every presidency, as in the United States Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70-80.
Some Republicans have doubts about the nomination.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s nominees for justice will normally be investigated, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI’s further investigation, it can still bring out something essential, according to Aaltola.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is at least certain that Kavanaugh’s suitability or inadequacy for office will still be widely discussed before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be taken to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman Identified Salisbury Suspect as Military Intelligence Agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
According to the photos, the woman said it was Anatoly Tshepiga, a military intelligence officer at the GRU.
Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia have previously revealed that one of the men suspected of being poisoned was Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified Tshepigan from images published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok neurotoxin in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia denies the alleged GRU connection.
The men, suspected of poisoning, said in an interview with Russian television in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throwing bags in health and social services reform
Now we have a vivid example of what the restriction on changes in health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä Government means in practice.
Vaala’s health and social services services are provided by the Oulunkaaren kuntayhtymä, whose former Regional Director of Attendo has been elected as the Director of Health Services in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the council of the change limiter.
If spending on health and social services goes up now, municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers in the municipality were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the institutional care of the ward of the health centre and a small unit for the memory-diseased.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre "at home" to be treated.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay it customers.
The Vaala left did not swallow the poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which attracted many relatives, close nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the regional health and social services preparation slides on how the municipality of Vaala already treats the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Westerninen, a councilman from the neighbouring municipality, was also involved.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it again brought the Oulunkaari draftsmen to their hind legs.
Sote-preparators do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care they will receive with it or with what kind of personnel structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until they receive hospice care.
Without a nurse?
In other words, the health centre will be closed down because there is no doctor’s emergency services at night.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Vaala Health Centre.
Vala’s example shows how centrist officials run councillors with insufficient information and delegates are stuck with their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way, the Centre Party clears Vaala of its inhabitants, because who will remain unsafe to live there voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was there a single vote in the centre to keep the whole country inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands of people demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River already in the morning.
“Erdogan is not welcome,” he said on the protesters’ signs, and the slogans denounced fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected on the streets in advance to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
There were also supporters of Erdogan near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area mosque from the surrounding area for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and estimated that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel on Friday vowed to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries on issues such as human rights.
Criticism Surrounds the Visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia State Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to an anti-Erdogan protest in Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
At the final stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Slovakia Charges Three for Journalist's Murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian people on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing defect, Sunday Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to common boxes has to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem could continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bundles of magazines in the province.
The rest of Finland’s subscribers’ magazines will be mailed separately only on Monday with stickers.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about her upcoming space trip, which she booked Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, and a bank loan was needed to pay for it.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space long ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight that took place in 2014 and even claimed a fatality, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that her journey takes place about a year after the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres,” the Finnish astronaut said on his website.
At the same address, he also backs up his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on television.
Star Wars has been seen, and that’s where the idea came from.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a tough host.
Manchester City continued their undefeated course in the Premier League when they knocked out Brighton on Saturday at home with 2-0 goals.
The sixth-win guaranteemen of the reigning champion team's season were goal sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute off the back post of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he sawed the Brighton defense into pieces with Sterling in the 65th game minute.
The Argentinian was able to place 2-0 finals at the penalty point with ease.
With six wins and one draw, City, which has started the season, leads the Premier League with 19-point catches.
However, Liverpool, which played less than one match, lurks just one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elect new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations elected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members of the council were elected, the Finnish Youth Associations announces on Sunday.
The Youth Council was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational goals, the Youth Society Meeting in Joensuu makes three promises: We will keep the doors open for everyone, and we will organise equal leisure activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth Association.
Lewis Hamilton praises Kimi Räikkös and surprises Ferrari: 'Losing a very important driver'
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not stay in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on the PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with the Russian race.
Valtteri Bottas from Mercedes starts at 2 p.m. from the pole position.
The evening newspaper follows the race moment by moment.
The A-Youth Championship was a complete farce, with only 7 players.
The top level of the football boys' league ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the round started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship competition were clear: FC Lahti Academy has a point against Vasa IFK in practice.
In order for the situation to turn around in the final round, Ilves, who is second in the championship battle, must win PK-35 and wish the Bayers a loss.
However, the Lahtin championship was confirmed in practice even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player, the match could not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
On the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-juvenile SM-series, i.e. the P20-series and men’s Group Two C-group.
Vasa IFK has played practically all season against the fall in the second.
In the final round of two on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Siilinjärvi Toivala.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno, according to the rescue services, luck was involved
A passenger car drove out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno on the Juttavaarantie on Sunday around 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue services reported.
Good luck, the statement said.
Rescue services said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol was at the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of inquiry: Equipment procurements and recruitments have already been made, the planning of activities abroad is not mentioned
According to Antti Pelttari, Chief of Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
Once the intelligence laws enter into force, the supo budget would be permanently increased by approximately EUR 10 million.
The Security Police (Supon) premises located on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing for the entry into force of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of Supo’s assembly, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams sings in topless video, campaigning for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now he’s campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on his Instagram account in which he sings only with his hands in front of his breasts, according to the news agency AFP.
The song is a 1991 hit by Australian artist The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the activities of the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voted for The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to do regular self-checks," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic affects all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it saves many lives.
The co-author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the comments in the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
This was the result of the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the head judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for far more violent behavior than women players.
Chinese Restaurant on Mountain Trail Not Suitable for High-Haired People
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves wonderful scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on a cliff.
If you wish, you can see the forest below.
The steep landscapes in the heights cause restaurant visitors to gasp for breath in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened for hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the bathroom is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
The end of the Korpela alley race today: This is how it all ends
All good things will come to an end in time.
This is what happens today to the Finnish country drama Korpela’s Alley Run, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone like a hot rock: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television as a premiere.
The peak figures themselves are no longer of practical significance, as there is no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, Charlie and Mirkku’s relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska’s mother seems to be the first to guess what’s coming.
Even the relations between Anssi and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events downright romantic, but then Laiho appears once again.
The police are also suspicious of the man.
But no one knows what happens in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some incredible news.
The last will of the distant comes forth, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week, Sunday evenings will continue with new episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela's alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Should I go to work tomorrow with a cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people choose to stay home or not.
However, a worker should consider whether it is worth infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear creeping out.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem small, says Prevention.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted a day before the symptoms start and from then on from five days to a week.
Children can infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize your symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough subsides and there is no fever anymore, says Professor of Medicine Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Returning too fast to the gym slows down recovery.
In addition, be sure to wash your hands, throw in a handkerchief, and throw your snot papers in the trash.
Moving hard, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You don’t put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezing is also limited with the mask.
How can we avoid infection?
The best way to do this is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Miss Finland tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Ice hockey player and missis are often associated with each other.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa has won the Miss Finland crown 2018.
She now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian Finnish and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for his father's Russianism.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all,” Alina says at the semi-finalist event of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the Miss Beauty found new friends and the everyday life started rolling as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you’re an adult, but in hindsight, I really wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
Since his career in the SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a remote relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got to the winning trio and that would cause me to have a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, our trust works well and the good thing about a remote relationship is that the spark keeps up all the time,” Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death on our tails
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s resilience.
However, we do not want to give up anything.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but the theory of the moderate economy also faces major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has given ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of for a few generations.
However, the long-term overstrain of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to destabilise this market economy.
Two men were stabbed in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m. on Sunday night.
The man, born in 1986, was seriously injured in the stabbing and the other, born in 1968, was milder.
The older men have already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible role in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn: Inter's coach regrets mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the handicap of the match to 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt made it through from the right side and luckily raised the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest saber, the Mariehamns reached the difference to the Turun Palloseura in the place of the series qualifier.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg stated that the team, however, did not break into the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but fortunately the goal of Turku brought us more strongly into the game.
Home team Inter head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but scoring again was painful.
One defense mistake took us a full score,” Allen lamented.
We were the best again!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland has been ranked number one in 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it with human capital.
Finland was ranked number one in the survey, which measured citizens’ health, education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital between 1990 and 2016.
The study was published by The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The states of the continent took seven of the worst places in the comparison.
He's got Niger in the tail.

Lehtehä showed his underpower skills, but the position of the game is not yet certain
Jori Lehtehä's strong underpower play came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the start of the season.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehtehä pitched Michael Raffl twice to score.
Over the past few days, Lehterä has been on the scene due to drug suspicions.
On Wednesday, MTV reported that Lehtehä is one of 23 suspects in a drug association where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
Lehtere has pleaded not guilty to the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, who is closely following the Flyers in the Philadelphia Inquirer, estimated after the game that Lehtehä is part of a group of six strikers, five of whom will get a place on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second period, Lehtehä fought the puck for himself by underpower, drew the defender on him and pitched Raffli, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open position.
For the second time, the duo's cooperation brought the goal right at the end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide if he will be included in the NHL Group.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best and I can be proud of it.
The coach will decide if I want to play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” Libra said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.
The Libra woman, who had her puck-taught in the riverboys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With a Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and turned down 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit by an overwhelming power when the team overthrew Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised by Ilves, defender Juuso Välimäki received a pass point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Among other things, the Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koskinen.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played for more than 20 minutes and pitched a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's consolation goal midway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the losers' goal Joonas Korpisalo rejected the 23/27 puck.
More than 180,000 responses to the time of day survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey concerning the decision on Finland’s future time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already gathered more than 180,000 responses.
The survey that has been opened in the Otakantaa.fi service will still have time to be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as other Nordic, Baltic, Central Europe or Western Russia.
New photo shows change: World's strongest man lost dozens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall has long and determined to win the title of the strongest man in the world.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed up to 200 pounds.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
“The British man hunted the world’s strongest man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen at the April 2018 World's Strongest Man pageant.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram in which she poses in a much slimmer condition than her active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now exercises five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling, and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, the strongest man in the world was an Icelandic, Hafźór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the Game of Thrones TV series.
The last Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Standardly caught on the rocks"
Inland vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alert for a water traffic accident on Friday night after 9:30 p.m.
The 30-metre-long vessel M/S Tampere has fallen to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, says fireman Matti Willman.
The ship carried 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue services, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and nearly all crew members have been evacuated from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere,” said Chief of Emergency Services Jari Nieminen to STT at 1 a.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumunensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
Firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and quite strong winds.
Rescue services say the ship's fate is unclear.
The ship is apparently not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a private conference room on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LL.M. Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged a total of more than EUR 80,000 in unpaid management fees with interest on late payments.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other option.
This has been a clear assignment, and a lot of work has been done,” Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomi.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to the Evening Magazine, which tells the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
In return, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was agreed that Helenius would only be required to pay fees as a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly affirmed that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed on and would have been absurd in Helenius’ situation,” Sundman explains in a message.
There was never a written agreement.
In return, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the start, but Kokkila and Sundman could not come up with the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be bad for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been given an "unidentifiable but extensive" bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s posthumous activities to be cowardly, the response states.
Helenius is today facing the heavyweight challenger list of the Boxing Federation IBF, seventh Erkan Teper, in Stuttgart.
A man of heart and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-running radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The host’s death notice was published in the Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The announcement says Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the fate of an acquaintance.
He said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a well-liked person with quick wits and funny stuff.
I got to know Erkki already as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
That's when Erkki and I met.
At the time, he was Finnlevy’s spokesperson and in various positions,” Ile Vainio recalls.
When I progressed to making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how big a fire he had on entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
For many, he became known as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Eric interviewed me several times.
He was good at speaking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked not only as a journalist but also at Fazer label with Toivo Kärkä.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work, where he had a distinctive style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year that ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The union describes its economic situation as having experienced a "full turnaround", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "substantial debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management have been ingrained throughout our organisation,” Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also been successful in the acquisition of partners, and the return on the World Cups was maximum during the previous competition season.
However, the management of costs must also be precise in the future, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the back of a hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of those moving around the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school,” Baharuddin told AFP.
In the yard of the Army Hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at the start of the quake at a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited back to the wedding.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe,” Haris told the AP.
Small shops being looted
At the Palu evacuation centre, the 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many Palu residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo trees.
Even if the house were somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu Prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were enraged and set the prison on fire after guards told them not to go looking for their relatives who were affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land on the field was an army C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land in the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the control tower was severely damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long period of rain spreads across the country from the west on Sunday night, the Finnish Meteorological Institute says.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in central and northern Lapland sleet or snow is expected.
The frosts of the previous night are not reoccurring, because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
A more cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control quite effectively.
It is possible to visit the cold side of the West for a moment, said the meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainfall will move towards the east during the morning.
To the south and west there are boulders or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu in steps of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in sea areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the weather will be typically variable in autumn.
Autumn is really starting to get ugly, he said.
Miss Finland finals will not be on TV
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment editors will host a live broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast starts around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned from among the ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at the Billnäs ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the finale starts, you will be able to watch the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV’s live broadcast.
The live broadcast starts at around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a lot of the previous year’s Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
They will be represented on the jury by Miss Suomi Jonna Ziprus from 1998.
Other jury representatives are well-being entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni Kauppi Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen from Seiska.
We were hoping he could go to college before he went to the Miss Pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in the success of their daughter in the Miss Finland final.
Alina Voronkova’s parents, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow her daughter’s first moments with the crown.
They came to the audience from Pertunmaa and were still going to drive back home after the final.
I love the atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival, I was really nervous.
Svetlana is an Ingrid and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived her whole childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career as a Miss.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she had to become a Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina became enthusiastic about beauty contests.
The parents wanted Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her bachelor's degree before the Miss Games.
Last year, we asked him why he didn’t attend, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri works in Japan and was unable to encourage her love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that a relationship between young people lasts a Miss Year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
The parents hoped that their daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break from visiting because of the Missichs.
I miss you even though you have sent me messages.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti, and police arrested three people.
Police say three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentionality of the hit-and-run, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the people arrested and the man killed in the hit-and-run knew each other before.
Further information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a cartoon came to mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Organic nonsense started from my husband’s statement in which he suggested it to a story I developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, a Finnish comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator in economic and legal matters in Brussels until, after her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a housewife very well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what I would do when I was growing up when even the smallest child started to grow up.
Then in 2014 came the cartoon.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintti and Asterix since he was a child.
The last time I was a child was when I was drawing, but when these organic nonsense scripts began to emerge, things changed.
I started with dozens of scripts in the box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I couldn’t attract her until the summer of 2016 when I donated Viivi with the help of a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying myself, laughs Piippo, who says that the record was a great incentive for him.
A hard drive is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, Piippo tells about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
The scripts are constantly coming to mind, but I usually don’t make them all at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates Dilbert by Scott Adams, among other things, from contemporary newspaper comics.
The characters of the organic nonsense are L-themed carrot-bodyed mother with salad-haired butt.
The other characters are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In a world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced bun, even though Luomuhumppää sometimes pushes the issue.
Piippo tells her that she is reading her series with her husband and children.
It’s such a wonderful feeling when you look at a cartoon you’ve drawn and find out that this is what I’ve done today.
There are enough challenges for a housewife.

Lottery’s million-dollar jackpot went up — these were the real numbers
There were no total hits in round 39/2018.
The biggest wins of the evening were seen in Saturday Jokeri, which brought 20,000 euros to Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, there will be $3.6 million in the lottery.
Saturday Joker found two 6 correct results.
Another €20,000 prize travels to Vantaa in S-Market Tikkurila for the winner who has played with a Veikkaus card.
The other was caught by an online player.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself, did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were safe
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has emerged as the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung was left alone in an air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake-stricken island.
The young man was in charge of air traffic control at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when an earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to pilot Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower trembled and cracked.
In the end, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake further intensified after the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people were killed.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn said: “I’ll have to watch the next tweet.”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated all over Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
President and CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle’s first morning that although the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Rehn believes that Europe is a very good talent.
It has been able to establish a peace agreement with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be at the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then review it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the whole Western world.
The market reacted violently yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year’s deficit will be over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and more than ten per cent are non-performing loans.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country again seems to exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet another crisis, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would lead to a new economic crisis in Europe.
The second issue facing Europe is the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
A contentious difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn took over as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in the speeches.
It would be no problem if Finnish names were included, Rehn said and added that he will not comment on the matter further.
HS’s super-popular Black Box shows will resume next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on 2nd, 8th and 11th October.
On October 23, Black Box will visit the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold on Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not been published in any HS media before.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
“There’s a strange spy in Helsinki’s night, an impressive report from the other side of the globe, and a telling story about a very topical health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organising live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been in the audience.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Awards as the journalistic act of the year.
The winners praised the new way of doing journalism and journalists’ desire to come close to their readers.
The spring season 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be seen at that time will have different content than the evenings of this autumn.
Missing mushroom killer found thanks to 'unprejudiced experiment'
Finnish police’s drone expertise is among the best in the world: “We are being asked for training”
According to the Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom picker in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Police University College, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprejudiced experimentation and effective education, we are at the top of the world here too".
The drone is quite new and even newer in the police field.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone operations of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
More and more common
Himberg points out that it is very important to find the missing person as soon as possible in winter conditions in Finland.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found by a drone in just a few minutes.
Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they are going to be trained more.
The drone is already widely used in police duties, and its use will become more common and more common in the future.
That’s what I’d say, Himberg said.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain types of intelligence missions.
For example, you need to check a certain area a little further away, where you may be afraid that there will be violence.
The drone can then be used for advance reconnaissance.
Karelian Rugby
Karelian Rugby won the 2nd Division in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still halfway through the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and porched the southern guests 26-12.
The championship of the 2nd Division also marked the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1st Division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at the time, the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-series and the multi-sectional 1-division.
The club is going to take a place in the series, but that will mean a lot of work next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
NHL head coach Claude Julien confirmed on Twitter that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super-promise Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong grips in September's practice games.
In his first training match, Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for having taken big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season starts on Thursday night.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership this week.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, told HS in an interview about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also mentioned the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and unspokenness, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company’s rise phase disappeared.
During the week, a giant business event Nordic Business Forum was held in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business life to the Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, there are 12 business stars on the stage.
Good leadership was enough.
Management legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a store chain known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate the purpose of the company to the entire staff.
And that purpose cannot be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book introverts, said that the most successful leaders are researched to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown to a mature stage needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were heard by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A good leader requires a lot.
That’s why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
There was also a Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other behind the scenes.
I don’t know if they were the right leaders at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrives on red carpet in Los Angeles, spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The showy dress of 2012 Miss Finland also had a lace train.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me how he is.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for an audition.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he says that the work needs to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the model’s work.
“You have to push harder and be aggressive,” Chafak said.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30,000 Live Art Award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
Lindfors, recipient of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury said.
In addition to the Finnish artist Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo 'we can't tell you where'
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic had been closed at the Øresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlann was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift chief of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
We've found the car we're looking for.
We cannot yet tell you where the car was found,” Henrik Storm of the Copenhagen Police Department told Ilta-Sanom.
Storm said the black Volvo had no direct connection to the threat.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Bladet told police about Saturday's press conference.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what criminal code would be used to investigate the case.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people’s lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police will not say if they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people vote on the issue in controversial elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the Republic of North Macedonia would be renamed.
Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s attempts to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
Voting began slowly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital city of Skopje.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, called for support for the deal.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
This is a change for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been officially referred to as Macedonia since its independence in 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough excitement as to whether the turnout will rise above the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but winning the yes vote would allow the mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of the parliament is needed to change the constitution.
The Greek Parliament has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
What a great win!
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF Association heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
The winner may be given the opportunity to fight on a Saturday in more difficult tasks, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left-handed strike.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third round, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were scheduled to fight in December 2015.
That's when Teper pleaded for injury and withdrew from the match.
It was then revealed that the German had been caught twice in a doping test.
Helenius has won 28 of his professional career matches and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches and lost three times.
Hamilton to win, 50 points to Vettel
The Formula One championship title was once again nearing confirmation, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel already to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position of the race, drove second.
Bottas, who took the opening win at Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Kimi Räikkönen fourth in Ferrari.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last line, was fifth.
Two men assaulted a Juuka man in Joensuu - they were caught a block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Juukalainen man at Siltakatu 12 in Joensuu on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also stole the victim's phone.
Police reached the suspects, i.e. a 35-year-old man with haywater and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, a block away shortly after the event.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
Musk has also been fined $20 million for tweeting that he would have secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock market.
The SEC has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to serve as CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement on NAFTA with the U.S.
Time is running out between the United States and Canada for a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators from the two countries have held intensive talks throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The U.S. and Mexico want to bring the deal into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said Canada’s involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow enough time for the United States Congress to assess it.
Neighbours thought the candles were blazing in Kaakkuri - the fire department was alerted to the scene
Candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the scene due to a possible apartment building fire.
It was discovered that the candles burning in the sauna in the apartment apartment had looked like a fire to the opposite house, which was why the emergency services had been notified.
There was no fire on the target.
Police arrest 11 people after Honka-HJK fight at airport and metro station
The police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and interference.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
I was told earlier by the evening reports.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushes and fist fights between the supporters of the teams.
To end the situation, it was necessary, among other things, to have Mounted Police officers.
In addition to the field, the rioting took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn’t there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant,” Värtinen pointed to the brawl that had taken place in the field.
According to Värtinen, no crime has been reported as a result of the events.
The tablestone beats butterfly swimming in its SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have reached the finals on the final day of the World Swimming Cup 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The races are swim in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS Tablestone beat the Finnish record in the 50 m butterfly swim, where he was second in the preliminary rounds with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during the SE-time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus in Espoo, was the 24th butterfly swimer in 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the first rounds of the 50 metres breaststroke at 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
In the first round of the two hundred-meter mix, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: the ancient tragedy - the reduced Oresteia impresses with its visual
Tragedies of antiquity are a rare delicacy on the Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre last saw an ancient tragedy, Sophocleen Philoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour starting from the National Theatre the only surviving play trilogy of antiquity, the Oresteia of Aeschylus.
In the Lavat Open! projects, which began in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, with meriting an hour to twenty minutes, especially by intensifying the choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur’s fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentations revealing the pages of the theatre space emphasize simplified and clear stage thinking.
It is centered on the dynamics between performers who alternately break away from the choir, who play title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War and his spoils of war, Kassandra, are also shown on stage, unlike the tradition of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern interpretation is created in front of the viewer, faithful to the text, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of acting students from the master’s stage as a close group, even as a single organism.
Especially in choir sections, actors who are flexible in very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights bare, only decorated with a white curtain, on stage.
I'm impressed.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new technology is starting to be visible in Europe, thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and H2 Energy in Switzerland.
According to a partnership agreement published at the Hanover IAA Commercial Vehicle Show, Hyundai will deliver a new model of 1,000-car batches for use by a Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue to drive the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell on the road as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refueling network,” said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor.
Fist several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
Police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another police officer in the foot.
He also threatened police with assault and killing.
He was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is being investigated in three counts of assault and violent opposition to an official.
In Kajaani city centre, there was also another case of assault on Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked her down and the man who hit her earlier still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police were called.
However, the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask the witnesses to the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email to investigation.kainuu@polisi.fi.
Long-term radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, a long-time journalist at Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Here we go.
The doctor said, “I’m living one day at a time,” he said a month ago.
The safety of the store’s aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When you’re surprised by a story, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, Sept. 27) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert from the Finnish Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers say otherwise.
Only clearly serious cases are reported to the police and many real situations of violence remain unreported.
“Companies are, of course, obliged to record their near-miss status on the basis of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always cause physical injury.
However, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no intervention.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store's got guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media was also showing a lot of the impact on sellers’ safety.
“At the time, quite a few employers organised guard services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well under control due to the guarding, the impression arose that the guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions to eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the victim of abuse does not want to make a request for an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near a store.
But according to the same subparagraph of the 2011 Act, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it takes place in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should be investigated and the prosecutor charged.
When the court put a few abusers in jail, and the sentence there for the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society in which a grocery store must be open almost night and day in small towns must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crowning of Miss will not be seen on TV this year as usual, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a loud round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male host,” Sohlberg exclaimed his colleague as the audience cheered.
Many of the leading races are followed by Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg glanced at Sara.
Most likely, Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siepp with his throw, who laughed at the comment, even though at first he seemed confused.
He spoke for the first time about his divorce in the weekend newspaper of the Ilta-Sanomat.
Missikaunottar said she does not want to explain the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said that he is not in a hurry for a new relationship, but is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status came to light even later when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio laughed at the screw-up.
He was married, or what?
Janni Hussi signed the mistake.
Pohjolainenman tortured his cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding concentrated sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous offences against his common-law partner.
Among the means of committing the crime were belt, cable, and cable ties.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the State.
Rank's charge was against the suspect for aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm were attributed to the Kokkola employee.
The crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the incident, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two serious deprivations of liberty and a aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public report on the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had directed violence, threats and coercion against his/her spouse in situations where he/she had been tied up.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed him with concentrated sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By its verdict, the court ordered the state to forfeit the means of crime: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife, and pruning.
The Four Witnesses
According to the district court, the two parties continued to live together between the acts.
It is clear from the sentence that a large part of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the crime episode.
The court heard four witnesses, two women and two men.
A 34-year-old must pay compensation for pain, aches, suffering and temporary harm for a total of 5,800 euros.
He hardly has the money in question, for the condemned man already has debts in debt collection.
Prison is not a man’s first sentence.
The newspaper does not give the sentenced person’s name to protect the victim’s privacy.
A recent trial is not final at the time of writing this.
Europe Leads Four Points to Ryder Cup Solution
On Saturday, European golfers captured their lead in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup by 10-6, with 12 doubles to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that started Saturday, and in the afternoon's doubles, the wins were tied 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played as a pair on Friday and Saturday.
No European couple had ever done anything like this before.
On Sunday, the duo are looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three of the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns violent harassment of its supporters in Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning their supporters’ disorderly behaviour at Saturday’s FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some seemed to be seeking to sue against Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The police officers were not able to calm the situation, but they needed policemen and also policemen.
HJK said in a statement that the players and staff members of the team were shocked by what had happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old club.
"We strongly reject any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to assist the authorities and event organisers in investigating factors that threaten safety and in eliminating mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, positive and encouraging activities in football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies in a drone car to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He is now part of a growing crowd around the world who swear that they invented a flying car - or at least their own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from around the world, he has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made his first successful test flight - he was flying his device at an altitude of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will trigger positive reactions.
“This was just a dream five years ago,” Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action to start tomorrow will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the overtime and shift change bans will start tomorrow, especially in social and health services and in child day care, says JHL Chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The impact will be extensive and will certainly be reflected in the way that there are not enough staff on the scene.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are in play and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that staff have not been hired, but that employees have remained overtime or changed shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is normal for every employee to take care of the regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government’s plans to reduce the protection of small companies against dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director for Local Government Employers, will not undertake a preliminary assessment of the effects of overtime and shift change bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by sector, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences of similar three-day activities by the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and the Social and Health Care Trade Union Tehy.
Their effects were rather minor.
JHL’s overtime and shift change ban applies to employees in municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health care sectors, among other things.
For example, family carers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial action affects nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that this is a run for the wall and hard.
He believes that both the trade union movement and the government must come to the fore.
What’s strange is that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
A large coral reef is created by children and adults - the exercise circles of the performance study the gestures of rays and seahorses
The Great Coral Reef, a collective in other spaces, premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer-defined presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a lot of magic in the theatre for children.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s performance but a performance made by adults and children in collaboration.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children receive information and make art.
Children’s ability to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also softens the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat similar to a fairytale ballet, a fitness circle and a nature-themed awareness strike, but it finally tunes in in different, non-human spaces around visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with the study of the movements of corals and coral reef organisms and fish.
In six different exercise circles, you will learn the gestures of rays and seahorses, among other things.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour, with music, lights and shiny paints and costumes to help you explore the life of the coral reef.
The large coral reef is home to both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being looked at.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Eyes and observations in many directions make the performance dense and teeming with life.
Whether it is a landscape of an organism, a landscape-viewing organism, and another organism or landscape-viewing an organism — and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn’t seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thought and action through its exercises, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Disasters beyond man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it might be difficult to grasp the importance of exercising one’s own compassion in the face of visions of destruction.
In other spaces, the work has been built in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also through a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears room.
Children are growing up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that she had to pick up her fifth-grader sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend".
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn’t possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned throughout our childhood that intoxicants can’t be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today’s children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early due to the group pressure created by their friends.
On Instagram, I’m constantly seeing younger girls with makeup on their faces and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evening to capture and send revealing images.
It is becoming increasingly difficult for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I’m glad there were no smart phones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and didn’t have to worry about what others would think of me.
Officials tell government that Airiston Helmi case has nothing to do with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Defence Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the Airisto Helme investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
The information from sources who appeared to be anonymous was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (Kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered a financial crime.
They were very strict about not speculating that there would be anything else,” Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle’s data, no evidence of a link to national security has been found in the seized material so far, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way we can know what will be revealed, says one of Yle’s interviewees.
Extensive home searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely a matter of financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the newspaper compiled an article that reviews the allegations for and against.
Video: Dream Goal Saved Liverpool's Undefeated Series
Liverpool's 100 percent Premier League start came to an end, but they were still more satisfied with the team's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 away victory.
Back then, Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to dominate his own field end alone.
Chelsea had a great league cup away from Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to decide the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho of the triangle game.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rushing forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there bombed a complete left-foot stroke into the lower back corner.
Pool brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and got nothing but his fingertip on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the losing position was lightly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's steering off the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea-vesser Kepa was also able to get into action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, with his throw, resetd Hazard's pass through.
The best spot for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
However, the brass star's buffer was directed at national team friend David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
It didn't last any longer in the 89th minute either, when changeman Daniel Sturridge was able to freely shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet at the top corner in honor of it.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the top of the league - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also heavily involved in the championship battle with two points behind the top.
When it comes to the clock, the holes are deep.
I remember a few decades ago when a newspaper asked various Finnish influences about what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow’s answer was only remembered: the Nen ending.
Some have a nen ending in their last name and some do not.
There's a division line that can be created anywhere, and here's one offerer.
In the EU, Finland has made it possible to abandon the annual clock shift.
Many people agree that changing the clock twice a year has been a job for fools and has caused many problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide what time of day you end up with: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The public can also comment on this on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The discussion is heated on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the effect of morning light on people’s well-being and those who defend summer time with the effect of evening light on people’s desire to go outdoors and, therefore, well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light can make a person’s day more restful and refreshed.
On the other hand, if you don’t particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases people’s movement outside and gives you better opportunities, for example, for autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather have both, but we can't do anything about our place in the north of the world.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical of a discussion on a subject is that one’s own point of view is pursued and the other’s point of view is strongly opposed.
You don’t listen to the arguments of the other side, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is very easy to debate, because the matter does not require much effort and a mutual feeling is enough to justify it.
Similar issues are usually debated in the strictest and equally fruitless manner.
It’s a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I’m sure it’ll adapt.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels miserable.
Josba fought a close away victory
Josba's first away game in the floorbally's Divar produced a full three series points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led by goal at the start of the third period, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
With both teams penaltyd, decisive minutes were played at the equaliser.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was strong enough, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played his goal at the time of birth in the second line.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
We will be visiting O2 in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th Anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
The fire at the church last week was a shock.
The church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place to celebrate.
Even if no one wanted to do so, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass starts at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, move on to the parish house at the Karelian banquet table.
There are a lot of things in the program all day long, both inside and outside.
For example, you can visit the church building under the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a retired parishmaster for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The already disused parish house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in evasive space at the former municipal hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing still for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk to step down as head of Tesla’s government’s speech after $40 million in fraud charges settled
Electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and Elon Musk, the company’s CEO, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC, the U.S. Securities Regulator.
The SEC suspected Musk of being guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
Musk will be forced to step down as chairman of Tesla for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board chairman.
Musk will also be subject to more stringent controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent executives and further monitor Musk’s communications.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla's shareholders," said Steven Peikin, senior vice president of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk tweeted that he might withdraw the company from the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla’s stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of being guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue Musk and the company.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went down sharply.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The number of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency.
The death toll is expected to continue to rise, as the investigation of the damage is still ongoing.
Vice President Yusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of Palu on the island of Sulawesi.
A warning was issued about the tsunami immediately after the quake, however, which was quickly withdrawn.
Officials say almost all known deaths are from Palus, at least for the time being.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Ruins for Help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue efforts tirelessly day and night.
One of the centerpieces of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said that one person was excavated alive at night in the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular among business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearance equipment would be needed quickly for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
Family members of a friend still missing, one writer pleaded on Facebook group.
Politicians’ phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information leaked due to shortcomings in the app's encryption.
Interruptors were able to access the telephone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an application used in the Conservative Party's party convention in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Secretary of State Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to a lack of encryption in the application, the public had access to politicians' profiles in the application, which were in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public could access the profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to briefly change Boris Johnson's profile picture to a porn photo and title offensive.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can view the contact details of the profile person and send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician, and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesperson apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The ICO supports the information leak.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party is critical of the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week there is a large crowd of applause Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland.
Spectator-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland quiz show.
The rapidly spreading American format The Wall landed as a Finnish version for Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the large 12 meter high wall of the format required space from the space.
During the initial period, a studio audience of the program was raised on social media, which was bet Polish.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of the four domestic programmes, sheds light on the matter for Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes players’ close friends, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland, and just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international applauders in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the filming of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls that fall from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for foreign speakers who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events simultaneously for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was recently delivered in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland.
He had simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the filming.
Japan's Typhoon is heading towards the main islands, officials warn of landslides and floods
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but officials say major injuries have been avoided and the deaths are not yet known.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off by more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at some stops due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the route of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
The train was cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami will be tormenting Japan until Monday.
The sky of aces was darkened even more.
The beginning of the aces has been bad.
The sky became almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasan Sport on Saturday at their home ground.
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points from six rounds.
None of the Aces defenders or two lower-chain players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
At the end of the game, the audience was out of the hall when almost half of the game was left.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to be worried, because that’s how much we played.
In particular, the performance in the second period was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki told Aessi.
Of course, the sport had a win.
The team had a game on Friday, so you would have thought it would show up.
Maybe it did show, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to bread day continued to increase
Pirkko Hyvärinen, the mother of Bread Day, wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall.
I thought I might not be able to get so many people this year, I think.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Club Championships were held together with Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it was not the case; the corridors were already blocked before 10 a.m., the sellers reported that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold than before, almost 500 portions were sold, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had risen.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later this afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon were especially suitable for families with children, which probably attracted them to a record number.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further away.
Sellers also turn to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred presenters, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
There were 11 different types of bread in the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in a martto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right mood in the interior and read the book without tiresome eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do a favor to your eyes.
The importance of lighting is increasing the more age years are behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people face with age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
The need for light is also growing older.
A 60-year-old needs light three times as much as a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the properties of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
Right now, the decorator has a choice.
The favourite has a gestureless Japanese style that combines Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colours, metal in different shades or ice cream colours, has also emerged as a boom.
Authenticity fascinates you in the same way as in other interiors of your home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more people are investing in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, we want a custom-made, even bold lighting fixture that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very design conscious, Jokiniemi says.
The home is not necessarily a new trend lamp, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics hold their ground year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian striker after three games
KooKoon and striker Brendan O'Donnell are parting ways.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games in orange black with no points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August on a one-year contract, which included a probationary period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old striker played for Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and KHL farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new company is yet to be announced.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - the goods are sent to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic was changed to paper
Nowadays, not only games, but also packaging materials are recycled.
The products of brick and mortar shop customers are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packages from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us will be re-used.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in such condition that it can be used,” says Ville Puurula of the Oulun Pelimäinen.
As padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Avoid plastic bubbles as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to switch to recycled materials in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra burden, according to Puurula.
It’s not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies’ operations, as in addition to new products, the store’s key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying each fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in an outfit like no other.
With their versatility, they create the foundation of a good gardenerob, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at an affordable price.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material with polo collars can not be a mistake purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt and jeans, and around it you can create both a discreet outfit and a brash style.
The polo knit is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look is born from golden brown and wide-leg corduroy trousers, black polo knitwear and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, a blue-green Scots petticoat and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Bring an edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy clothing: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
Russia’s intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service (KGB) in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, according to archivist Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), who defected to the West.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers for undercover operations for DRG groups.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints from the peninsula to roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
Cold War agents hid supplies packs of mines, explosives, lighters and communications equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
As late as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, with a trapmine detonating when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the province last night.
Police across North Karelia arrested four drunk drivers between Friday and Saturday night.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
At 2:30 a.m., he was driving two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanintie.
On the Kuorevaarantie road in Polvijärvi, the car fell into a ditch at four o’clock in the night, and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
He did not suffer any serious injuries in the exit.
A 20-year-old man driving a passenger car in downtown Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mil into the breathalyzer.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition, of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting observations of the stabbing that took place at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police say the man was beaten in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The incident was recorded on CCTV.
The dark-haired suspects, dressed in dark trousers and a brown or beige coat, left immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon towards Ratapihankatu bus station.
One of the suspects was taken off by bicycle in the direction of the centre of Humalistonkatu.
Pedestrian killed after being hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. in the morning on Raumantie at Niittumaa.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, Sports Director of HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in the start, underpower play and in the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played during the trial period in the early autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, underpower play and in the defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is a good idea for the young team to hold onto such an experienced player,” says Mika Toivola, HPK’s Sports Director.
According to Toivola, the value of Risk increases when playing Ice Hockey League resolution games.
Riska, a centre-back from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
On the other hand, winger Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after a probationary period.
The real story on TV today is that the climber was left to die twice.
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest.
The movie was made based on that.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 film is about the struggle for survival, which has been discussed extensively.
The tragedy has been the subject of films and documentaries before.
Real events are also discussed in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the highest mountain in the world killed eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by eye surgery performed before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and atmospheric pressure, he lost his sight, which was why the conquest of the summit had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on his way and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he lost his way and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When they came to search for him, he was found in such a poor condition that no one believed in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
But, miraculously, he got back on his feet and found the others.
The ill-frozen Weathers were thought to be still dying and once again was left to his own fate.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church of Eno
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was consecrated on 4 October 1818, and a feast for the whole family was prepared for Sunday to celebrate the anniversary.
The celebrations began at Eno’s church hill at 10 a.m. with a family mass, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at Eno’s parish house.
The church was full.
A total of 517 people participated in the family mess.
The pastor of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that so many people had come to church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and give strength to the work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Passionate Danger Church and were not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after Kiihtelysvaara Church was destroyed in a fire.
Kiihtelysvaara wooden church was completed in 1770.
A devotional was held in Kihtelysvaara in the morning, where the church was silenced and commemorated in the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A severe hurricane-like autumn storm swept from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images from the area show a lot of flooding around Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how between houses in the town of Kiato in Corinthia suddenly appeared a river instead of a street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, high winds caused strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Delegation urges that weather reports and instructions from local authorities be followed.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medicament, brings heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medics only occur once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left behind flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns have also been raised about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
In the summer, areas destroyed by wildfires are also affected by the storm around Athens.
In Greece, the Medican was also rampant last November.
We cannot go to the sea right now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm.
Expeditions to the sea are cancelled and you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk items in the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by the guides to more than 3,500 Finns in Greece on holiday through Aurinkomatkat on the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even storm Zorbas is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds can reach up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
Heavy rains add to the misery of the weather.
All those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland, who have provided their phone number, have been alerted by SMS, according to the tour operators.
The sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in the communications of solar trips, the worst has been avoided at the resorts by the beginning of Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety comes first.
Antonia Schroderus, a media assistant at Tui, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he said early Saturday evening.
Tui currently has more than 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes the sun had flashed and the temperature reached 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkatkat.
Zorbas is estimated to be the next to become a nuisance for Turkey, albeit somewhat mitigated.
In case of this, we have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya on Tui, for example, Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvisen and Janni Hussi have identical evening dresses in the Missi final - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for the evening.
The very same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirley Garvinen.
The two of them also noticed the same outfit and laughed at the situation.
Garvinen told Ilta-Sanom he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the Miss Final, and he talks to the front-row stars who arrive.
Hussi has recently moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday.
I’m going to stay here for now, we’ll see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Prior to his move, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirley Garfield's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention, garnering curious glances from seniors
The host and Miss Suomi Shirley Garvinen of 2016 said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland filming.
There has been enough urgency even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I put my hair and makeup on the plane.
This is the glamour.
A change of clothes at home, Garfield laughs.
Garvinen says she pulled out her makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking at me in the mirror.
My makeup was fun for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as the host of Love Island Finland.
He also said that his experience had to be stopped so far.
Garvinen says he went to see the singles on Friday.
It's kind of brutal in some way.
They are people’s true feelings,” Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles on the show.
How do I wear over-knee boots?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in an outfit like no other.
The classics are often decades old, but sometimes more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the over-knee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not gone away.
As the name suggests, the over-the-knee boots repeat their style from year to season.
Showy boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
In fact, over-knee boots are suitable for any outfit.
Whether it’s jeans, lace, tulle or tights, the simple leather or synthetic leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in both party looks and everyday outfits.
The black over-knee boots fit well even in delicate outfits.
They conveniently balance the femininity of a pink, floral plicher skirt and a tender, plush knit.
Fresh but autumnal stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit consists of a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-knee boots, spectacular earrings and a rivet little bag.
Although the over-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they also fit perfectly into a casual casual outfit together with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It’s so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring traffic in the area will be started by a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robotic cars will cope with the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-world environment,” says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully automated in other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles constantly sense their surroundings with several sensors and assess whether the roadway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake,” says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run three days a week throughout the autumn: on Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, on Wednesdays from 10 to 15 and on Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Stops in robotic cars are recognized by stop markings.
The most secure way to get on the bus is from stop number 1 at Otakaari.
Mokoma's bassist fell off stage in the middle of a gig and was injured
The Mokoma band announces a surprising situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig on their Facebook page.
The Mokoma band’s show at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was doing the last song of the night.
He broke his wrist.
The band announces this on their Facebook page.
“We are in the Spirit!”
Santtu tripped yesterday in Pakkahuone from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour will take place on the pages.
Mokoma's fans respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist Santtu is lying in a cast with his hand on the bed.
I was waiting for this news, so I was worried about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones fortunately heal over time.
Good luck and good luck to the rest of the band!
And thank you for last night, it was a great show, but you promise to stop doing such dramatic shows in the future?
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting monitoring on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department’s batch contacts reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting license required on state land.
In addition, the licenses for the possession of hunting weapons were checked as well as the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in chicken birding.
According to police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily fines for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, police blew up 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, patrols handled five traffic violations in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters adhere to the permission of hunting very well.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (Kok.) will visit Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been admitted to Finland.
Selection visits are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of people coming to Finland than are included in the quota, because in practice some people do not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs working on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, will also be on board.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has taken in quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached in the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has last fallen into resistance from the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä recently proposed increasing the quota gradually to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit will be the first during this government term to be made by the Minister of the Interior on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland will receive €10,000 from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're off the hook, you don't know if you're going to cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that in principle the bill prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees in relation to production animals, pets or other business activities.
Therefore, everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it probably means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety or good manners of society.
In principle, we are now introducing a ban on all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business operations and nothing else can be done until the act or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The government’s legislative work in general has been weak.
If you start on the road that in Finland everything is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But the bill in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder whether it will accept this 'all is prohibited, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell: The Four Trendiest Skirts of Autumn
This autumn's trendy outfit comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good on the skirts.
Combine a snake-colored skirt with more subdued tops, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep the outfit look stylish.
This autumn we see a lot of silk and the silk skirt in particular is one of the most trendy items of the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt in a sophisticated way with a feminine top or casually paired with a knit.
You can play with a silk skirt even more courageously and throw on, for example, sneakers or autumn trend shoes cowboy boots.
No matter whether it’s gray, brown or multi-tone, all plaid skirts are now included in every woman’s must-have.
Boldly combine different colors with each other and play with the grid pattern also on the top with different textures.
For example, the combination of plaid pattern and spherical pattern is beautiful.
The asymmetric hems are a breeze from the lightness of summer, which can be carried with you into autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetric hem is feminine and playful and is perfect for both everyday life and celebration.
Baby Alexia, 3 months old, sulks sweetly in Jere's arms
In the family photo of the Karalahtis, the focus is on the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family addition at the beginning of July.
The couple’s first-born son, Jax, turned 2 in May, while the little Alexia is just a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, which included the whole Karalahti family.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the Spanish atmosphere posing as the whole Karalahti family.
The children Jax and Alexia are in the arms of their parents.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly sulking baby Alexia, who rests in Jere's father's arms.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, people’s generosity and joy, Nanna Karalahti writes along with the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and former ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, who came out of the Fitness Diaries program, recently went into kindergarten business and opened a Aito day care centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahtit, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisaranti, who is responsible for the education side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the director of the daycare centre.
Turkey calls for charging mobile phones in case of storm
The storm Zorba, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday called on citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access so that people can receive timely status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been advised to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture, for example, away from the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago, when I contacted him, the wind was strong and it was raining.
People were calm,” Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
He described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, the ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
Finnair announced on Saturday that the weather will be monitored actively.
Kimi Räikkönen summarizes the reason why Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece in the time frame of the Russian GP.
There is no reason to panic at the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver said.
They were just faster than us, but there’s no big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourthly, and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
He was asked what caused the sudden fall of a Mercedes.
They seem to go faster than we do - it's as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably be going at the same speed as them.
But I know no more than anyone else.
This is a constant conjecture, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare delicacy was seen in the time slots for the future stable Sauber of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen next season with Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For a Swedish driver, the 10th position is the best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers failed to drive altogether, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps an encouragement to the Räikkönen in the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early part of the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius: “Robbe is back”
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in the evening of Stuttgart progressed evenly.
The German was more proactive in the ring, but he couldn't get a good hit.
Clearly, Helenius controlled the match with his tough sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in clearly better physical condition than Teper.
The settlement finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the old man who fought in front of the home audience did not even try to get out of the rug.
When the victory was confirmed, Helenius was quite calmly ventilated.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then, for a moment, he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.
We brought a belt today.
Helenie was happy right after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helen’s career.
There might even be a chance to get into a World Cup match, Helenius commented to the Evening Magazine before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
It’s not going to get any younger,” 34-year-old Helenius admitted before meeting Teper.
Number of Indonesian disaster victims could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
Vice President Yusuf Kalla said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for trapped and also dead people in the most affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Palu and its neighboring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, the situation in Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered an army to rescue and clear.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are broken in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäs Ruukki is currently selecting a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, each Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of the glass bowl on stage.
In particular, Emilia Anttikoski, 23, the hesitating response of the finalist number six, produced a sweet but benevolent laugh in the audience.
The question that was put to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before he hesitated.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I’ve read is....Anttikoski said thinking.
A pause for reflection made the audience laugh until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I’ve read is...
I read books in school!
Probably something economical.
So the last book I’ve read is economics, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Missi tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 21:00 when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will step down.
Sike's apple and pear cake takes your tongue away
This recipe is for those who have good, acidic apples on their own, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may need to buy pears, even though a lot of people are already growing pear trees.
This cake can only be made from apples if you don’t want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste will be more varied if you add the pear to the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt butter in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam, then add the corn flour and melt butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch, or maizena, with baking powder and add them to the dough as well.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the casserole and spread the pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Allow to cool in a dish and then reverse to serving dish.
Cut the cake properly when cooled.
The cake is brittle in texture and crumbles easily due to the fact that the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January
In January, Kuusamo’s Ruka will host an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature for the first time.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers, as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include the Swedish mystery fiction star Jens Lapidus and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist behind Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature guest writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and Kuusamo’s unique surroundings provide a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analyzed the issue, have outlined two types of "coolness" consisting of slightly different features: the generally attractive coolness and, in part, the opposite dissident-coolity.
Attractively cool people, according to the researchers, had many traits considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They were thirsty for experiences and cared little for the assessments of outsiders.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardy is not cool in the long run: high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
According to a study published in the journal Child Development in 2014.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good-looking crowds and sought favor with others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once unobtrusive peers.
High-status cars, badges or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more willing to make friends with a regular market shirt than with people wearing a brand shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand shirt when they were introduced.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a hurricane going down - a weather warning is screaming red
During the weekend, in southern Greece, it can rain as much as in Finland, on average, in six months.
Hurricane Zorbas will hit Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The upcoming storm is also reported on the weather service Foreca's blog.
According to it, the strongest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
In comparison, the storm Kuisma, which beat Finland in the beginning of the week, blew at its loudest about 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can be delivered in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on their Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men’s drooling Love Island Finland-Anku?
Appears on confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, several men’s drooling beauty Anku also appears in strange YouTube videos released in 2010 as a craft aunt.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make an octopus from an old roll of household paper.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can craft a hedgehog out of tights and grow the right spikes.
Now let's make the Easter grass grow, but let's do it in a somewhat surprising way, Anku hints and shows sawdust, tights and freshwood seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or from Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more than ten minutes after his pole position in the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes' first-star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly an important mental critique for the Finnish driver who also collected this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the settlement round.
It feels good, I’m still shaking, Bottas explained.
I’ve only been on the pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so quite a bit of time has passed.
This track has been good for me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so the start is particularly important.
And of course, Bottas was able to answer questions about whether he was going to win tomorrow or whether he was going to win the World Cup with Hamilton approaching the title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I’m trying to win.
There can be no other goal when the pole is left, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so that's something to keep in mind.
We’ll see what happens, but Bottas added.
After the race, Hamilton was genuinely happy with Bottas’ success, and what Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff saw was a taste.
Lewis had plans to win Valtteri, but he failed in the turn of seven.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to defeat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline was bursting out of his ears.
To the question of whether the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive uprightly, Wolff answered dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM-series of rallying ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up being Finnish champions at the same time.
Now this was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed him the Finnish championship in the SM4 category of two-wheel drive cars.
Honda Civic rival Kinnunen and kart reader Ville Mäkelä started the Turku round with moderation, because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to handicap when some of the additional lights failed on another special test.
It was a pretty blind spot for the third one.
In a situation like this, you don't have to be a jerk.
On Saturday we only followed the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was the second in the series, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria’s foreign minister has called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Secretary of State Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN address, Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey would be scheduled for October.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassing him, received an exceptionally large number of people on the screen.
In the United States, a full-blown Supreme Court judge nomination drama reached at least 20 million people on its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor accused of harassing him, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several millions more.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had set its record of the year with 8.2 million live broadcast launches.
CNN’s figure rises to more than 10 million when those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook are included.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are the channels’ own, the TV ratings are from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final figures on Monday, but they will be huge anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually only allowed to attend sports matches, the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The most watched program in the United States every year, the NFL final game of the American Football League, the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl attracted around 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first address to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and his inauguration by more than 30 million people.
Top priority
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge is an extremely important case in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans were able to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was the so-called scales language whose vote could determine the position of the nine-person court.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities, and decided in 2015, for example, that same-sex marriage rights were granted to same-sex couples throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the right to conservative supremacy for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information from parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health data from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, the situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was made to the situation in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but the repair has taken an amazing amount of time.
Now the repair is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a big deal.
After that, with the layman’s understanding, it is a push of a button: when the wire is now closed, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information - if he or she has bank numbers or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
An ID card is subject to a fee, and a 10-year-old can't even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a fourth grader in primary school except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a question of parental rights as of children’s rights.
For the care of the child, it is extremely important that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right to privacy for teenagers must be respected.
Minors may also have family situations where not all issues can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the U.S., the FBI has started investigating allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
The FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
Earlier this week, one of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not be made public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at Kajaani police station
The man who had been arrested continued to pull the ball at the station.
Police say they put a man in a police prison to "calm down".
Police were threatened by a suspect on Saturday night in Kajaani.
Officials report an incident that began when a 30-year-old man sued violently in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the restaurant.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When a third party tried to intervene, the man also hit her.
The triple assault led to the call of the police.
A patrol captured the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police said.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police said they had sent a man to a police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work on Indonesia's Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF Information Manager in Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawesi, rescue operations are underway, but the situation is less clear in the Donggala region slightly further north.
There are places where connections do not work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
The buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - first of all, tents - and clean water.
In times of crisis, clean water is the most urgent.
First of all, people can be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in store.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported to the emergency by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is a part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the United Nations.
In the initial phase, the funds previously raised will be used for emergency assistance.
However, UNICEF has already started raising funds to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk Retires Tesla’s Board of Directors, Fines $20 Million for Tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rocket and electric vehicle companies, avoids fraud charges in an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk will step down as part of an agreement he signed with the U.S. Securities Regulatory Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk for securities fraud because of tweets he posted in August.
Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
Musk is not allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla’s board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent" member of its board and include two "independent leaders" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk’s personal fine of $20 million, Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Misleading investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billionaire tweets said the company would have been bought off the stock exchange at $420 a share.
Tesla's stock price went up by more than ten percent after the tweets in 24 hours, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He also had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the board of directors of the company.
On Friday this week, the exchange rate dropped by 14 percent when a securities supervisor, the SEC, announced a fraud charge.
The agreement is expected to strengthen the company’s price again.
The last sentence is not the cause.
The bells of the cathedral do not naturally ring when the hands do not move.
This is a technical failure.
The clock in the tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The hands are pointing at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: still when an exorcism is heard in the crypt of the church and the organ plays on its own.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
A repairman has visited it, but some parts have broken and a new part is expected,” says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
In fact, the account states that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says church bells don't ring because of a fault.
