The U.S. Gymnastics Association supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and accepts the Olympic family’s unquestionable need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the United States Olympic Committee that, in the interests of our athletes, our teams and their sports, it would be better to proceed through an internal, meaningful change within the organization than to lose our status as a federation of sports.

This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provided information that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on the top and light or carotenoid-coloured on the bottom.
In addition, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stem called a bone, but have other feather properties — such as barbs and beams — the researchers concluded that the bone is likely to be a later stage of evolution than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but for temperature regulation or soaking. Even if it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested that the sample came from an adult individual's plumage rather than from the chick's down.
Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested that the sample came from an adult individual’s plumage rather than from a chick’s down.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at Gaziantep's main police station in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The Baker-Hamilton Commission released its report today at noon Greenwich time.
The report warns that no one can guarantee that any action at this stage will be able to stop the war between sects, the increase in violence or the drift towards chaos.
The report begins by hoping for an open debate and consensus on US Middle East policy.
The report vehemently criticises almost all aspects of the current policy of the executive body with regard to Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostilities and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work was initially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe the effects of the tide between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the earth, causing tides, so does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect Sagittarius' dwarf ellips galaxies.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy surrounds it as a kind of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is highly worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them belonged to the hospital's healthcare staff.
The infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts during the year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all people with tuberculosis still seems low — 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people in South Africa each year.

They are cooler during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as flat as that of large caverns on Earth, which often have a fairly flat temperature, but it fits in with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Task Force and a teacher at Flagstaff University in Northern Arizona, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally not been state-of-the-art: voters close themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper on the envelope, on which they have marked the candidate they want.
After the authorities confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law has determined the course of events with relative precision.
In 1988, ballot boxes were ordered to be transparent so voters and observers can prove that envelopes are not in the box at the start of voting and that envelopes other than officially counted and authorized votes are not added to the box.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the event series. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision and following the prescribed procedures.

Four skiers from the women's seating group were unable to finish their descent, and 45 out of 117 skiers on Giant Slalom did not get placed in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Superintendent D.K. Arya said, "We've arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman, and found her cell phone and laptop."
The defendants have been reported as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court since then on trial for the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be corrupted, as his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and courts have ruled that publishing images may be detrimental to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University states that "journalists do seem to balance dangerously if they publish photographs of suspects, etc."
The Scottish Public Prosecutor’s Office, the Crown Office, has made journalists understand that no further comment will be made, at least before the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to pass the way they walked before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed included, according to reports, the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is calling for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the Palestinian Authority accepts this kind of presence for only five years.
The shooters involved in the supplementary control experiment on pests were to be closely monitored by forest guards, as the experiment was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualifying volunteers were recruited as a joint project of the National Park and Wildlife Service and the Australian Federation of Sport Shooters NSW and as part of the Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park conservation and cultural heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a delegation appointed by the president recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at taking the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
The protests, which have become violent at times, started with unfulfilled elections, some of which were to be held as early as 2011.
Overheating of malfunctioning iPods has been reported in about 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the accidents involving 27 devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had told it about 34 other overheating cases, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of Apple's investigation "really unfortunate."
The Mariana Islands were hit by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 21.19 p.m. Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
It was also reported from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center that there was no indication of the emergence of a tsunami.
Former Filipino police have held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza shot passengers with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on a medical career.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature childbirth during his idle time.
His studies showed that the administration of the hormone speeds up the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that an official team of investigators had found two black boxes, or flight recorders.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. Pretty unique case like she herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was...perhaps more...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Before the federal general election in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of those opposed to becoming an Australian republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister of the Department of Supply Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign that she felt Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed shared her views and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to remain the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to participate in the 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle and three relay races of the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been uncertain due to pain.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed to relieve pain, as their use is prohibited in the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime known to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February with various devices and software, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are born, and especially how Earth was created, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo's tenure as governor began earlier this year, and he signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political jawcutting and ridiculous."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The U.S. aviation authority claims NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older technology based on ground-based radars, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation and no ground trains stop at Wembley. There are also no parking and exit parking services available at the match site.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the development of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had evolved in two generations, although the process had been believed to last much longer, due to the mutual reproduction of the native Darwinian finch (Geospiza fortes) and the alien species of cactus cricket (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes and can also be rolled into small objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rotated and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted images in books called "book paintings".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. The meter can be made by using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e. alkaline) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the test chemical shows the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushable toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where women and men bathed in the same facilities at the same time.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To take a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet long.
The bike has changed the world in amazing ways. Much easier and faster movement is the greatest that the bike has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Under them come more medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized game from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Then there are many small feline animals (including loose pet cats) that feed on small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, the numbers of which are much higher.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological box. According to this concept, each cat has its own special function, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cat animals, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming sisters and daughters of a large family.
These animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and they are also very dangerous for their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far, and pull five times as strongly as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of large cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats know how to roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a sentence consisting of murmured, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they catch them. Almost all the animals that the ocelot preys on are much smaller than it is itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, that is, by the smell of prey, sniffing in the ground where they have traveled.
The ocelots can see very well in the dark because of night vision, and they move very unobtrusively, hunting by merging with their surroundings and then plunging at the prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different than before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so in order to be a strong competitor the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all, but it still needs the same adjustments as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations look so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means only the birth of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our house from plants and we make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was a great beast of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurus.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, in addition to which it had an extra row of teeth in the palate, so no one who hit it could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish, and other mosaics, and it could even be cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own strange or unusual delicacies, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a nut mouse.
The other difference was that the poor and women ate their food sitting on a chair, but the rich preferred to have a common feast where they lounged on their side while eating their meals.
Meals in ancient Rome could not serve food that did not come to Europe until later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of God.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called most holy, to which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built in temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary of God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the Hebrew family’s life was spent in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard, and the shops were just open sales tables along the streets.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
The Norwegian sagas said that Erik Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map was drawn on the other side of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because just because there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence is written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The inscription is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (its dimensions range from 29 3 to 4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up in the early days for storage.
It is therefore likely that the entry was only added as a name tag.
D-Day, or the invasions and subsequent fighting, had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was held by the so-called Vichy France, i.e. the French, who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders and did not fight them.
On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded southern France under the code name Operation Dragoon.
The U.S. and Free France forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture common to a large group of people living and working in co-operation, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city state, and in a way also defines the size of society.
Urban states are the precursors of nations. Civilized culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from one generation to another, to a long-term cultural footprint and to a large distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered to be true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was Congress - on the basis of Confederate articles.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive power or judiciary, it had to resort to the often uncooperative authorities of the states to enforce all its statutes.
It also had no power to change tax laws and interstate customs duties.
The amendment of the articles required unanimous approval by all states, and the states were so overly concerned with central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians even compete in them at international matches and Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because the islands of Japan are infested or in a group, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan began to be known as far back as the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed by mentioned the island using the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in south-western Taiwan, simultaneously triggering a change in indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty's armies took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing dynasty in 1885.
After a defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonosek, with which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most common size used in still photography in the world is 35 mm. It was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its aspect ratio.
A bit confusingly, the 35 mm size is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (divided into twelve to obtain the simplest size ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and much ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism in the image while still maintaining some order.
According to it, the most effective location of the main object is at the point where the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds intersect (see example).
In this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be looked at closely.
Christianity had united European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in languages and customs.
Its ubiquitous power affected all, kings as well as the people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the Church are intended for just such use.
The central power of the Church had been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question the realization of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the vital supplies of soldiers and civilians, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the previous two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire oceans and even posed a danger to neutral ships.
Since the tactics only sparked limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolation.
The nations, after seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous superior) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way to describe different periods: every phase of China or every family in power was its own dynasty.
Moreover, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of division of provinces, the most famous of which was the 60-year period of the three kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought fiercely in pursuit of the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for access to the highest seat of the mighty palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the idea of nationality, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were opened up to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the army, because military values were now based on capability rather than class status.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira and was located on the light-signifying mountain Nur.
The cave itself, whose time the tooth left alone, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located in one of the mountains rising north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very hard to find, even if you know it exists, and once you get inside the cave, the isolation is perfect.
You can see only a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little about the earthly world.
There are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Giza Sphinx, located in the Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of the ascending bow looks like a V and the sign of the descending bow is like a rivet or square with no underline.
A rising bow means that you should start at the tip and push the bow. A descending one means that you should start at the frost (that which you hold the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
The ascending spring usually produces a softer sound, the descending spring is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own inscriptions with a pencil, but remember that printed suspension marks are on the notes for musical reasons, so they should usually be followed.
A crowd of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elisabeth from Versailles back to Paris on 6 October 1789.
They came back to Paris in chariots as the crowd surrounded them and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their chariots completely.
At some point, someone from the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay the war costs incurred by American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover a significant part of the costs, and to take care of interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of American imperialism was, of course, the huge profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the background from which the organization came into being.
The era of events is usually spoken of during the Middle Ages, a period in European history between A.D. 1000 and 1300.
The Cardiac Age was preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers in practice a wide range of ideas about the so-called thrust of technology, i.e. the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is guided by the logic based on scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two basic ideas in common: firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a route that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and secondly, that technology in turn has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, the invention of a car would inevitably lead to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership results in more accidents on the road, leading to the invention of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major element in romance and drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography was considered to shape individuals. Over time, the customs and culture typical of this geographical location took shape. Because these were in harmony with society, they worked better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
Constantinople was considered the European fashion capital of the feudal era in the same way as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine market's supply.
It was at that time that the title of the fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
At first, the clothes were strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western European styles could be lagging behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most significant developments of the era, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes with the help of the Crusades.
Self-sustaining farming is farming that produces enough food only to support the farmer and his family.
A self-sufficient economy is a simple, often organic system that uses seeds natural to the ecoregion combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple ways to maximize crop yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sufficient farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by society’s norms, thus enabling them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, place and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that define a subculture as their own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality-related, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of the subculture communicate their membership with the distinctive and symbolic use of the style, which includes fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example the few unlucky children who were left without the socialization offered by adults when growing up, either as a result of neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called "wild". Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, the rejection has been due to the fact that the parents have rejected the serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived on their own in nature.
If a wild child has been brought up entirely by an animal other than man, he behaves (within his bodily limitations) almost exactly the same way as his guardian animal, for example, by showing similar fear or indifference to humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. Timely learning support (scaffolding) goes one step further.
A ladder is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real. In other words, the teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the small paper connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual ladders are built into the software and are designed to ask questions, give prompts, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone’s help.
Children are placed in foster homes for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but some live.
We consider the foster home system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving guardians, a steady education and reliable health care.
The purpose of children’s placement is to meet all of the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
In the case of end-use theory, the specific features of the Internet mean additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" as new aspects of motivation when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks described in his article The President's Speech, however, how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th-century research has shown that there are two stocks of genetic modification: latent and manifest.
Mutation increases new genetic variation, the choice removes it from the inventory of manifested variations.
With each generation, differentiation and recombination move variation back and forth between the two stocks.
A primate with a similar digestive system to a human has difficulty getting enough amino acids from the plants available on the savanna.
In addition, the absence of them has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and peas, but primates like us find it difficult to digest them without cooking.
On the other hand, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides a rich supply of all essential amino acids.
Therefore, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way as the savannah chimpanzees do today.
A sleep interruption means a deliberate awakening during a normal sleep period and falling asleep again a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively silent alarm clock that restores consciousness but does not wake up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as diuretics) before going to bed, forcing you to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of peace within a person corresponds to the amount of tension in his body and mind in the opposite respect.
The less tension, the more positive is his life force. It is possible for everyone to find perfect peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but the concept of the Mahajana, or Great Path, as well as many techniques of Indian yoga, was added to them.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces everything.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divinity Yoga. Visualization of the deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led the Soviet Union and the United States to cooperate. After the end of the war, the clashes of systems, procedures and cultures led to a break between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, previous allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was actually waged, as substitute armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defence had already broken by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced into the country and created Belarus and Ukraine's fronts after attacking the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and goods across the oceans.
It has traditionally been the task of the fleets to ensure that their own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods and at the same time interfere with the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy mostly tried to block this traffic by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goats were apparently domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to wear them to easily get milk, hair, flesh, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised as herds that roamed hillland or other pastures. Often they were cared for by goat shepherds who were often children or young, like the more well-known shepherds. These shepherding methods are still in use today.
Trolleys were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses to pull the carriages faster and with greater loads than the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Track-blocks were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place, but gradually it was understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top of them.
The practice became common, but iron consumed more than the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first whole-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of transport was walking. People began walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus (i.e., the erect human) developed.
The Australopithecus who preceded it did not walk upright as constantly.
Bipedal specialization can be found in the fossils of Australopithecus between 4.2 and 3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is often like treating the symptoms of the disease, but if we do not want a mere temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a great deal as a result of the scientific and technical advances of mankind, and the problems have grown because of overpopulation and the wasteful way of life of mankind.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed during the night, now known as Dunlap open sheets.
John Nixon first read the document publicly in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who allowed it to be read to his troops in New York City on July 9, with one copy reaching London on August 10.
The 25 open sheets of Dunlap, known to exist today, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things in birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosauruses.
Virtually all computers currently in use are based on the processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers — or in the professional language of computer circuits, bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms such as vomiting are so common that the diagnosis can not be made immediately.
The most certain characteristic of internal poisoning is an open container of medicinal products or a container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the first aid instructions for this poison on the label.
Entomologists use the term bedbugs actually for this group of insects.
The term derives from the fact that in ancient times bedbugs have been very common. Bedbugs are insects that are well adapted to human parasites.
Betrayals and bedbugs are both hive-delayed, adapted to life in their master's nest or cocoon.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or multiple sclerosis, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have a double tendency to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of themselves or their child.
These couples may, if they wish, draw up an adoption plan for their infant.
In adoption, biological parents waive their rights to parenthood, allowing the other couple to act as parents of the child.
The main task of science is to find out by scientific methods how the world works. The scientific method guides most of scientific research.
However, it is not just about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
As the Greek language weakened in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physique and behavior often depend very substantially on the existence of innate cycles and their emergence by means of biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been observed in most living creatures such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to circulate freely over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, either marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited in children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and access to information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting the orangutans of Borneo, learning from them, and photographing them.
Every morning the inhabitants of small rural towns go to work in their cars, and they are met by others whose jobs are where they left off.
In such a dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow connected to and at the same time supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that the huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or collapse bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, as the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively consistent manner, so traffic flows tend to have a reasonably good consistency and can be presented in a rough mathematical way.
In order to better describe the flow of traffic, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps in zoning, planning, and maintaining the roadway.
Insects were one of the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards against their bodies.
In this way, they have access to a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and sunflies are now the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the entire solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, 6 miles wide.
20 percent of the planet’s water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The length of the actual Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Empire, the size or construction of the pyramids of Giza was never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the new empire admired the monuments of their predecessors, who were already well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest in the world.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
The majority of those working in the state also speak Italian as their common language, but Latin is often used in religious ordinances.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known ordinary chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they all appear in nature as themselves and are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma in the same order — but he also theorized that they are transformed into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically alloys of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic system.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals. Of course, there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also metal alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that they could fit at the end of this sentence by trillions.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, with the development of new writing methods, the value and uses of the pencil have remained more rejected.
Nowadays, messages are written on a computer screen, and you never have to search for a sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes around.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it requires energy to form a nucleus consisting of many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart uphill, and then re-splitting the core will release some of that energy again.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which makes them prone to decay from a slight or non-existent nudge.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The thickness of the lunar crust is about 70 kilometers on the visible side of the Earth and about 100 kilometers on the reverse side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more dark sea areas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus primarily on exploring what is behind or appeals to people’s behavior.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's need hierarchy theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders begin to lead their previous peers, generally speaking, two different behaviors can be formed. At the other end of the scale is an attempt to stay "one of the guys" (or dirties).
Such a leader has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, keeping discipline, evaluating performance, sharing responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique components of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report. An invisible team determines the requirement level of each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a time-consuming process that requires setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be created.
As a result, a process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, managers need to create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more specific.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although strongly thought to be related to science fiction, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of information technology that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research aims to make machines automatically perform tasks that require intelligent operation.
Examples include monitoring, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become differentiated fields of study that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, artificial intelligence is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense, just as it is built into several software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching. Often the teacher would like to take the students to places that can not be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution, i.e. virtual class trips. Students can view museum items, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting on a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to remember it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. The site is renewed annually, but its old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of the students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often careless, but the audience's presence usually changes the matter.
Because the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to better hiff the world around them". The need to feed the readership's interest inspires students to be witty and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings, as well as bring up their own perspective on the issue in question" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, with a plethora of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and in the north are the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other things create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders regard as the epitome of Canada.
Large areas to the north are fairly sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
In fact, many are surprised by the demographic comparison: More African-Americans live in the United States than Canadian citizens in general.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of them and, in terms of its nature, like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it caused much wind in the Comoros and Mayotte under its wings.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women - All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, are advised to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn’t look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can result in what they may experience as harassment. It is not unusual for someone to follow suit, grab an arm, etc.
Be strict in rejecting men and not afraid to stand up (cultural differences don’t make advances legitimate!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BC by Berber fishers, and was used by both Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt by the Sultan of Morocco under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading stations there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting shopping places in Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old medina where traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, clay goods, leather products, water pipes and a wide variety of trinkets are sold, but all of them are intended for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the urban center.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all excursions outside the city require a preliminary investigation into the current state of ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, where you can also find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
A boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used for travelling in Goma. The usual (local) rate is about 500 Congo francs for a short drive.
Combining this with its comparatively difficult location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a symbol of exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different natural areas, each supporting a variety of fauna and flora.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park is subject to a daily conservation and admission fee, as is the case in all national parks in South Africa.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card to access either some of South Africa’s parks or all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is the main destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings forming the Hong Kong silhouette has been compared to the glittering column diagram, which is best seen in the water at Victoria Harbour.
The best of Hong Kong can be seen by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon port area across the street.
The majority of the urban area on the island of Hong Kong is located on a filling land built up in the northern shore.
It was this place that was taken over by British colonial hosts, and if you look for signs of colonial history in the area, it is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest mangrove forest area, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on the Indian side is called Sundarban National Park.
However, the forests are not mere mangroves, but include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one-third is covered by water or swamp areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are now 400 Indian tigers and about 30,000 axishirves.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those to the east and Jakar and Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since buses within the area are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
For most of the counties, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and sturdy.
Bungalow taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a diagonal rope bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 m, it is 378 m long, and has two lanes three and a half metres wide.
The underpass height of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be in full operational condition in September 2017, when the Brazilian border stations are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous groups living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but also engaged in self-reliance farming.
The Chaco area was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who came to terms by hunting, collecting, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "giant province of India", was the result of a confrontation between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples of the country in the 16th century.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted for three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for being one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
The Argentine Polo Federation provides news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is tied to the equivalent of the British Pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley is also frequented by credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the outside islands, although the currencies of the United Kingdom and the United States may be valid.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops to the side of the frost, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no special rainy seasons and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials advise to stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meter away from other wildlife.
Bisons, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, although they may look very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, please note that the scent attracts bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing highly fragrant foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships — German, American and British — refused to leave the port.
All of the ships sank, with the exception of one British cruiser, while nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
A peaceful gathering held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement led to the death of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of sandy beaches, because Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are located in three different areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific coast and continue from north Long Bay to south Devonport.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and the pohutukawa trees give shade to most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the port of Waitemata in the affluent districts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes congested family beaches, and the coastline is lined with a good selection of shops.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines worth a try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the way.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but careful people can easily find bottled water.
The idea of a flat white type of milk coffee is a guest to Australians. A small black coffee is known as espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of foamed milk. Tea is served without milk.
Cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
There are plenty of trips to the reef all year round, and injuries to the reef for any of these reasons are rare.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish are found north of 1770 near beaches and estuaries from October to April.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and are likely to swim away from the scene.
Delta crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, but their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The passenger receives peace of mind when booking in advance that he/she has a place to sleep when he/she gets to the destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation valid if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. visa) for your destination.
However, all changes and requests should first be directed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp in the area, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the events, you need to arrive on time to get a campground close to the music.
Keep in mind that even after the musical performances on the main stage have ended, there may be places where the music continues to be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate campsites for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during winter time, check the location of the cabin, as walking through the ice causes very terrible noise in the worst parts.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are usually no windows and clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood — and in the casino facilities.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages to the house, but drunkenness undermines judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive cars at high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and you can’t drive the same way you would on asphalt.
During a blizzard, there can be so much snow in a very short period of time that the car gets caught.
Snowfall or windy snow, as well as moisture or ice accumulated in the vehicle’s windows, may also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually operates year round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa’s biggest attraction and the highlight of many visits.
Popularly, the word safari refers to traveling by land, which is intended to view the magnificent fauna of Africa, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come near cars, and the usual equipment is enough to watch them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking afari (also called bushwalking, hiking safari, and hiking) means either a few hours or several days of hiking.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 25 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo becomes the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it was the host of the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, your situation can be tricky.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with tickets usually costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels can borrow irons and ironing boards even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or if you do not particularly care about ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are various ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in others several minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in closed bottles.
Tourists can come across pests that they are not used to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison and infect disease.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are usually not counted as pests.
Tax-free purchases mean the possibility to buy products in certain places that are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Tourists heading to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially for products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is dominated by the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway because it repeatedly runs in remote forest terrain.
If you’re not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: you’re facing a lot of steep climbs and falls, narrow lanes and steep bends.
The specified speed limits are significantly lower than for previous and subsequent sections — usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 kilometers per hour) — and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Strangely enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
The German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite thick and varied, reminiscent of the Austrian pastries of the south neighbour.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year round, and cherries and plums are popular toppings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you are looking for small but sturdy pastries, try one with the name Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a top concept covering a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But if the term is used without further definitions, it usually refers to food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javan cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and includes a large selection of simply flavored dishes. The flavors that the Javans prefer include peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The pedestals are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but they can be associated with safety concerns because the rider's feet may cling to them.
If the rider falls off the horse but the foot gets stuck in the pedestal, the running horse may pull him after him. Various precautions may be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots with a smooth and quite narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stand strap to come off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley — Chilean climbing site number one, known as the Yosemite of South America. The valley has a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
With breathtaking views from the tops, climbers from all over the world are constantly forming new routes to its endless walls.
Skiing sports, which include downhill skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where the snowy ground is lowered by skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many sometimes called ski bums plan whole holidays at a particular destination around skiing.
Skiing is a very old idea —cave paintings of skiers have been made as early as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called wilderness skiing, skiing or hiking.
It is related to alpine skiing style hiking or mountaineering, but usually does not include one because the latter is practiced in steep terrain, and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but only very rarely can you get at the same pace as skiing on maintained tracks and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean filling in visa applications and passing passport checks several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area is somewhat like a unified state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport checks again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also don’t have to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which prefabricated goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define all goods more than a hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location. For example, in North America, newer objects are counted as antiques than in Europe.
Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the related culture is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sámi people have participated in large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods and considered reindeer mainly as pull animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi people work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Romas, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If your country of visit is subject to a travel notification, it may affect your travel medical insurance and cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you should seek advice from other countries besides your own, even if their advice is for their own citizens.
As an example, Americans may find themselves in different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The announcements are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, generalized and oversimplified compared to more detailed information from elsewhere.
Hazardous weather is a generic term for all hazardous weather events that can cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur all over the world and there are different types that may depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, high rainfall and wildfires are forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, hurricanes, water statues, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal phenomena of dangerous weather include blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting the place of travel, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone wishing to visit a country that can be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search conditioned on the "Host Environment Course" will likely result in a local company's address.
The course usually goes through all the topics covered here in much more detail and usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2-3 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications on war zones are sparse.
Travelers planning to undergo gender correction surgery abroad should ensure that they have visiting documents for the return trip.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports without gender (X) or to update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery should not expect to survive security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the reversible flow of waves breaking to shore. They are often found in reefs or similar places.
Due to underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and there can be a rapid flow into deep water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won’t be taken by the stream again, or depending on your skills, and whether you’ve been noticed, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
Return shock strikes earlier than cultural shock (the habituation phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of your home culture habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding in the knowledge that travelers need to get used to the new land.
People do not necessarily realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
The pyramids can be seen in the dark, and before the performance begins, they can be seen in total silence.
Usually you can always hear the voice of travelers and peddlers. The story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are presented against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many states have claimed the Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest is the island of King George, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where a crater of a still functioning volcano filled with water serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea to the south of the peninsula.
The peninsula mountains merge into the plain there and then rise up again to form the 360-mile-long Ellsworth Mountains, which the Minnesota Glacier divides in two.
The northern part, the Sentinel Mountains, is home to the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massacre, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 metres.
In remote areas where mobile phones have no coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a call you have to be outside and keep unobstructed visibility to the satellite.
The service is often used for navigation, including yachts. It is also used by expeditions that need remote data and sound connections.
Your local telephone service provider will probably be able to provide additional information about how to connect to that service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is especially popular among those who leave their school because they can take a year off before college without their education suffering.
In many cases, participation in a gap year course abroad may even improve your chances of continuing higher education in your home country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participation in these curricula.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. There are also thousands of islands in the land of thousands of lakes, both in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
In islands and lakes, you don’t necessarily need a boat the size of a bite.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks have a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure hobby in Finland, where there are boats for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most actual cruises to the Baltic Sea include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still go back to bed overnight.
You do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on excursions organised by the ship (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not previously flown or experienced something traumatic.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it does not differ from the fears and dislikes of many others.
For some, some insight into the operation of an airplane and what happens in flight may help to overcome the fear of ignorance or a feeling of helplessness.
Transport companies are paid well for fast deliveries. Often, speed is very important for companies’ documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repair work.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods by air cargo, on some routes unloading and customs clearance could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as checked baggage. The regulation of the airlines does not allow the luggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point you are needed.
A self-evident way to fly in first or business class is to pay a big block of cash for this privilege (or perhaps prefer to let your company do it for you).
However, it’s not cheap: according to the rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of a business class compared to a tourist class and eleven times the price of a first class class!
On direct flights from A to B, it is generally not worth even looking for discounts for business class or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multinational republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the declaration of independence of the Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own administration and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million inhabitants, the country's second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and lively trading center surrounded by mountains and spreads around a huge bay.
Among the wide boulevards, glass-covered buildings and modern shopping centers are traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the city’s atmosphere is more like Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík has an unusual octagonal church, and the village overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy.
The churchyard has interesting dove sculptures on top of some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour walking in a fascinating village.
From there to the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. Foreigners will come to know it from the praising account written by Lord Byron, in which he depicted its splendor.
The ScottUrbi bus 403 regularly runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, it is also worth visiting the great Sanctuary of the Virgin Mary of Fatima, which is famous worldwide for the appearance of Mary.
Remember that you are practically visiting a mass grave and a site that is of almost incalculable importance to a significant number of people on Earth.
There are still many men and women who survived after they were there, and many others whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to toil themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Be sure to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't ruin the place by drawing or scraping graffiti into structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only marked in Catalan, as it is the first official language under the law.
However, Spanish is also commonly used in public transport and other services.
The usual announcements of the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system reports unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation as self-centered, rude and arrogant people.
Even though it’s often just an untrue stereotype, the best way to do well in Paris is to be as decent as possible and behave like someone who is “bien élevé” (well raised). It makes movement much easier.
The rude exterior of the Parisians will quickly dissipate if you show the usual compliment.
Plitvice National Park has a lot of forest, mainly beech trees, fir trees and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a considerable variety of plant communities due to a wide range of microclimates, varying soils and elevation differences.
There are also many different species of animals and birds in the area.
In addition to more common species, rare fauna such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and forests can be found there.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts covering the knees, and shoulders should also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a bright color, you may get a smile from a monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to be dressed in pants that extend below the knee.
They can also be borrowed from the selection of clothes at the entrance, but they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Mallorca cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses all kinds of olive oil.
A simple popular dinner especially in summer is pa amb was: bread with olive oil and tomato, as well as any available side dish, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, plus the word "Sie", or "you", always begin with a capital initial, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a nounized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G deserve the most attention, as their pronunciation depends on the next vowel.
Also remember to pronounce r and rr differently. Caro means beloved, carro carriages.
Persian grammar is fairly easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help you learn many things about Persian grammar and improve your understanding of phrases.
Needless to say, if you know a Romanesque language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who know a little Spanish may suddenly imagine that Portuguese is so close that they do not need to study it separately.
Today, old-fashioned observatories are not usually used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Since light pollution in their glory days was not the same problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities and are located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Looking at cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was Japanese pricot.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take at least "just one" as a sample.
If you visit an official and well-kept garden, you will fly from collecting "samples" out without any buts.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it is very easy to find your way there. You can buy almost anything after arrival.
But being in the heart of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you have to endure both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, what happens less often).
In addition, a few buses travel north to Hebron, according to tradition to the burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish colony of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan your holiday.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities along the Danube, or a boating in the Erie Canal.
They also determine the course of popular hiking and bike routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated on the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers and non-Christians from Christian countries around the world have also adopted many traditions associated with the festival.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake somewhere open to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often deliver Easter Night Mass on the Saturday evening of Easter Weekend. The congregation often breaks out to celebrate the midnight hour to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came there by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant turtle became the main grass-eating animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience a polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It offers a good opportunity to see the northern lights, because the sky is dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may have been accustomed to.
Costumes are an ordinary work uniform, and colleagues call each other by surname or title.
Reconciliation in the workplace is absolutely essential. Instead of personal achievements, the emphasis is on teamwork.
Employees often have to get the supervisor’s approval for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the supervisor’s instructions without any other complications.
