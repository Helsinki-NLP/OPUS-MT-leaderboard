800 miles of Trans-Alaska oil pipeline was closed when thousands of barrels of crude oil leaked in Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage after a routine fire technology test caused the safety valves to open, and crude oil leaked out near Fort Greely pump station 9.
The opening of the valves allowed the pressure accumulated in the system to be discharged, and the oil flowed on the platform into a tank of 55,000 barrels (2.3 million gallons) of capacity.
The tank valves continued to leak on Wednesday afternoon, likely due to thermal expansion in the tank.
Another barrier area below the 104,500 barrels had not yet been filled.

According to the organizers of the demonstration, about 100,000 people arrived in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
There were an estimated 6,500 protesters in Berlin.
There were also demonstrations in Paris, Sofia, Vilnius, Valletta, Tallinn, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, some 200 people demonstrated outside the premises of some companies that control copyright to a large extent.
Last month, there were major demonstrations in Poland when the country signed the ACTA agreement, which led to the Polish government deciding not to approve the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed their accession to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again calling for the installation of surveillance cameras to be mandatory in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of RSPCA New South Wales, told the ABC that monitoring and inspections of slaughterhouses should be commonplace in Australia.
The use of surveillance cameras would certainly be a clear indication to people working with animals that animal welfare is a priority.
The United States Geological Survey's international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Institute has also not reported earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last two days.
The considerable seismic activity that led to the phase change had been experienced on March 10 on the northeast side of the top crater of the volcano.
Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds could have caused confusion as to whether the eruption had occurred after all.
The luno had 120 to 160 cubic metres of fuel when its engine broke and high wind and surfing pushed it toward the breakwater.
All twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters, and the only personal injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long vessel was on its way to pick up its usual fertilizer spray, and at first authorities feared that the load might leak from the ship.
The proposed amendment has already been passed in both Houses of Congress in 2011.
The amendment was made in this legislative session; the second sentence was first deleted in the House of Representatives, after which it was passed in the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
Since the second sentence to prevent same-sex civil marriages was rejected, the door may well be open for future acceptance of civil marriages.
At the end of the discussion, HJR-3 will be re-evaluated in the next post-election parliamentary term, either in 2015 or 2016, in order to keep it under discussion.
Vautier's achievements included, along with directing, the 1973 hunger strike by which he opposed the censorship he considered political.
He started activism at the age of 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in his 1998 book.
In the 1960s, he headed back to the newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was found to be intra-liver biliary cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only a former Olympic champion and world champion at the time of his death, but also chairman of the Japan Judo Federation Training Committee.
At least 100 people attended the party to celebrate the couple’s first wedding anniversary last year.
The official wedding anniversary event was planned for a later date, according to officials.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
Born in Buffalo, the 30-year-old husband was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who has taught at Modern Education and King's Glory preparation schools. According to his own claim, he had 9,000 students at the top of his career.
He used words that some parents thought were rough on his label, and reports say he used power words in the class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission, as well as lying when he had claimed to be the main educator of the English language.
He has also been charged with copyright infringement in the past, but was not formally prosecuted.
A former student said that he "used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like a friend of the students."
Over the past 30 years, China has developed a market economy, although it is still officially a communist state.
The first economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, the Chinese economy has grown 90-fold.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States as the largest market in the industry.
In the next two decades, China’s GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
Tropical Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
A storm about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has a maximum sustained wind intensity of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center have predicted that by Wednesday Danielle will have strengthened to a hurricane.
As the storm is far from the coast, its potential impact on the United States or Caribbean islands remains difficult to estimate.
Born in Zagreb, Croatia, Bobek gained fame by playing for Partiza in Belgrade.
He joined the club in 1945 and remained with until 1958.
In his team years, he played in 468 games and scored 403 goals.
No one has played in more Partizan games or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995, he was the best player in Partizan history.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-famous Cirque du Soleil group.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janizar Orchestra, and the singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
After that, the spinning dervishs entered the stage.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Anatolian fire performed their Troy act.
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcyclist, has died after a crash at an Indianapolis circuit.
Lenz, who was in the warming round, fell off his bike saddle, and was then hit by rival Xavier Zayat.
The track's medical staff immediately took care of him, and he was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Zapatero further said of the global economic situation: "The financial system is part of the economy, an essential part.
We have suffered a year-long financial crisis, the most acute moment of which was experienced in the last two months, and I believe that the financial markets are now beginning to recover."
Naked News announced last week that it plans to significantly increase its international and multilingual news activities with three new broadcasts.
News coverage is already available in English and Japanese, but the global company is starting to produce Spanish, Italian and Korean-language programmes for television, network and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but the sight was macabre as people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit the window panes with chairs, but the glass was unbreakable.
Eventually, one of the screens broke, and people began to get out through the window," Franciszek Kowal, who survived the accident.
Light and heat are emitted from the stars because energy is generated when hydrogen atoms merge (i.e. fused) with each other to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to develop a reactor that could produce energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will take many more years for usable fusion reactors to be built.
The steel needle floats on water thanks to surface tension.
Surface tension arises because water molecules on the surface of water attract each other much more than air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible film on the surface of the water, allowing a needle, for example, to float on water.
The blade of modern skates has, in a way, two blades with a concave groove between them. Thanks to the two blades, you get better grip on the ice even when tilting the skate.
Since the lower part of the blade curves slightly, the edge of the ice is also curved as the blade tilts to either side.
If the skates tilt to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they need to get rid of the excess energy they received from the light.
They do this by radiating a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Scientists refer to this process as stimulated radiation emission, because bright light stimulates or stimulates atoms and causes the emission of a photon of light, and light is also one kind of radiation.
The following image shows how photons radiate from atoms. In reality, of course, photons are much smaller than in the picture.
The photons are even smaller than the particles that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of use, the filament finally burns out, and the lamp no longer works.
In this case, the lamp needs to be changed, and when changing the lamp, you have to be careful.
First of all, the switch on the lamp must be turned off or the cable disconnected.
This is because electricity that flows into the placenta to which the metal part of the lamp is attached can cause a serious electric shock if you touch the placenta from the inside or the metal base of the lamp when it is still partially attached to the placenta.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
The blood leaves the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops' teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but even very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the triceratops ate cone palms, which were common plants during the Cretaceous period.
They look like small palm trees with a crown of sharp, spiked leaves.
Triceratops could have used their powerful beak to rip the leaves off before eating the trunk.
Other researchers claim that no dinosaurs were likely to eat these plants because they are very poisonous, yet today the sloth and some other animals, such as the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs), are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you stood on Io's surface, you'd weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) in Io. That is, of course, gravity pulls you down less.
Unlike Earth, the Sun has no crust on which to stand. The whole sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas thins as you move further away from the center of the Sun.
The outermost part of the sun we observe is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used the telescope and discovered that Venus has phases just like the Moon.
The phases occur because only the solar side of Venus receives light (the same applies to the Moon). The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks discovered the transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace after Danelagen had been recaptured.
However, in 991, Ethelred was confronted by a Viking fleet larger than any since a century earlier by the Guthrum fleet.
The navy was led by Norwegian Olavi Tryggvenpoika, whose goal was to free Norway from Danish domination.
After the first military setbacks, Ethelred managed to come to an agreement with Olav, and he returned to Norway to try to win his kingdom back, with varying success.
Hangul is the only alphabet specifically developed in common daily usage. Alphabets were invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and one of the most respected.
He originally gave the hangul alphabet the name Hunmin jeongeum, which means "right sounds for the teaching of the people".
Several theories have been put forward about Sanskrit's ancestry, one of which concerns Aryans who brought their language with them when they wandered from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world is written in the Sanskrit language. After the gathering of the Upanishads, Sanskrit faded due to the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as a source for many modern languages of India in the same way that Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France had ended, Germany began to prepare for the invasion of the British Isles.
Germany gave the attack the code name Operation Sea Lion. Most of the heavy armament and equipment of the British army had been lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk, so the army was rather weak.
Yet the British Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any offensive fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, the bases of very few British naval ships were located near probable routes of attack, because the admirals feared they would sink in the German air raid.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly a "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
Italy's land and naval forces were weaker, although it had recently, just before the start of the war, built four new ships.
Italy's main objectives were in the African countries, and in order to conquer them, it needed a springboard for its troops to cross the Mediterranean in ships and invade Africa.
That is why they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and the Italian battleships were supposed to do nothing more than that.
Japan was an island nation, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to move underwater and stay there for long periods of time.
Submarines were used in World Wars I and II, and at that time they were very slow, and their range of weapons was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly traveled on the surface of the sea, but as research began to develop and they became more accurate, the submarines were forced to move underwater to remain invisible.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans knew how to sail and use their submarines very skillfully.
Since the Germans used submarines so successfully in the war, they will no longer be trusted to use many submarines.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called King Tut or Boy King, is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, in ancient times he was not considered to be of great importance and was not added to most of the ancient lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. Many of the tombs of the past had been looted, but this tomb had been virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved, including thousands of items made of precious metals and jewels.
The invention of the Polish wheels made the Assyrian war chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to defeat the soldiers and other war chariots at speed.
Arrows of the Assyrian deadly crossbows were able to pierce the armor of the opposing soldiers.
The cavalry is an army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous figure in the culture is Homer, a legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems called Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are counted among the greatest works of world literature.
Famous Greeks also include the mathematician Pythagoras. He is mostly known for his famous theorem concerning the sides of rectangular triangles.
There are varying estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is estimated to be the second, third or fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether the speakers of very closely related dialects are included.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, with up to 800 million people able to understand Hindi.
The vocabulary of Hindi and Urdu is similar, but the writing system is different. In everyday conversations, speakers of both languages are usually able to understand each other.
Northern Estonia experienced considerable cultural influence from Germany around the 15th century.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the indigenous people, and so they invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet with one letter: Õ/õ.
In time, many words borrowed from German merged with the language, marking the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne transferred directly to the army after completing his school.
Charles, on the other hand, started at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He first studied anthropology and archaeology at Cambridge and later history, graduating with a grade of 2:2 (lower second grade).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a degree.
European Turkey (East Thrace, or Rumelia on the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country's total.
The Turkish land area is over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, and is approximately rectangular.
Turkey includes lakes with an area of 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 sq mi (291,773 sq mi) is located in south-west Asia and 23,764 sq mi (9,174 sq mi) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world by area and is roughly the same size as parts of France in Europe and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by the sea in three directions: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it did not become independent until 1839.
A part of modern-day Belgium was formerly part of Luxembourg, but passed to Belgium after its revolution in the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always sought to remain a neutral country, but Germany occupied it in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of what is now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the highlands of Paro County in the village of Phondey.
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is reported to have founded the fort in 1649 in commemoration of the victory he received from the Tibetan and Mongol forces.
Due to a fire in 1951, only some of the relics of Drukyal dzong remain, e.g. a picture of zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fort was left in its ruined attire and protected, and remains one of the most impressive sights in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed by two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those in employment work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of the working Venezuelans are in the service sector, nearly a quarter are employed by industry and a fifth are employed by agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans, a net exporter of oil, although only 1% are employed in the oil sector.
The expertise gained from the Singapore Botanical Gardens helped in the early years of independence to transform the island into a real tropical garden city.
Hybridarchidea vanda miss joaquim was chosen as the national flower of the country in 1981.
Nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate each year from the northern highlands over the Mara River to the southern plains during the rainy season.
And then through the west back to the north, again over the Mara River, after the rains have ended around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Ngorongoro Reserve and the Maswa Game Reserve in Kenya, and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Interactive design requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned through interactive courses (picture scripting, audio and image editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires that assumptions about media production be re-evaluated and learned to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires that the different aspects of the project are interrelated but are also sensible individual entities.
The complexity of the focal points and the number of lens elements required to achieve the focal length scale are much greater than those required for fixed-burn lenses.
This is an increasingly rare problem, as lens manufacturers get better quality in the production of lenses.
This allows zoom lenses to produce images that are of comparable quality to those taken with a fixed focal lens.
Another drawback of zoom lenses is that the lens aperture size (speed) is usually smaller.
Therefore, low-cost zoom lenses are tricky to use in low-light conditions without flash.
When trying to convert movies to DVD format, one of the most common problems is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to please the general public.
That’s why everything you see on TV has been cut to the edges above and below and on the sides.
This ensures that the image fills the entire screen. It is called overscanning.
When making a DVD recording, unfortunately, its edges are also likely to be clipped, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won’t show up completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired imagination and conjured up images of tournaments, banquets and the chivalry of Arthur stories.
Just standing in the midst of a thousand-year-old rubble, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of battles of a long time ago, almost to hear the buzz of hooves on cobblestones and to smell the fear rising from prison caves.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle, typical of its period, is a fortified house rather than an actual castle.
Its large, glazed windows and thin walls could not have endured a determined attack for long.
When Lord Hastings began its construction in the 1480s, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was needed only against small groups of raiders touring the country.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries sought to maintain the national independence of all European states.
The idea was that all European countries had to strive to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful, and so their governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main cause was the balance of power.
This meant an important change, because the European powers no longer had religious wars as an excuse, and therefore the Thirty Years' War was the last one that could be called a religious war.
On July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed by the arson of Herostratus.
According to the story, he was motivated by a reputation at all costs, and the stunned Ephesians declared that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabon later mentioned the name, and that is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered as king to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible, but still press all the keys correctly. Also, try not to make a lot of extra movements with your fingers.
This way you get as tired as possible. Remember that you do not need to press the keys strongly for a higher volume like on a piano.
The harmonics can increase the volume when using the bellows at a higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the attempt to connect with, identify with, or gain awareness of the highest reality, divinity, spiritual reality, or God.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or a deeper understanding of divine reality or deity or beings.
Followers engage in a certain lifestyle or practices designed to promote such experiences.
Mysticism stands out from other forms of religion and worship in that it emphasizes the direct and personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those of a beautiful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion native to the Indian subcontinent, originating in the Punjab region as a sect separated from Hindu tradition in the 15th century.
The Sikhs regard their faith as a separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion gurmat, which is Punjabi and means "the way of the guru". Gurus are a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism their importance is so great that it forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by the guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine other gurus in order.
However, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956 when the Polish riots, in which workers demonstrated due to food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some financial demands and agreed to appoint the popular Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.
The civilization of the Indus Valley was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, encompassing most of modern-day Pakistan and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River Valley, where its name comes from.
While some scholars believe that civilization should be more aptly called the Indus-Salavast culture, since it also appeared to have dried up in the Sarasvast River basin, some call it the Harappa culture because its first archaeological discoveries were made in the Harappa excavations in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the taking of medical developments.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors, and even the first Roman medical forces were formed to be used in the aftermath of the battles.
Surgeons were familiar with many different sedatives, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds and scopolamine from crazy cabbage seeds.
To save patients from gangrene, they became adept at amputation, as well as using tourniquets and varicose pliers to stop bleeding.
Over several centuries, great medical advances were made in the Roman Empire and much of our current knowledge was gathered.
There are such limitations to the Pureland origami that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds, such as reverse folds, are prohibited, and all folds have a straightforward position.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced artists and people with movement limitations.
Children's awareness of race and race stereotypes develops at a rather young age, and such racial stereotypes influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify as belonging to a stereotypically poorly performing racial minority at school begin to fare worse at school when they learn of stereotypes about their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have their advantages, including the fact that you can easily create your own page for a class, which can include blogs, videos, photos, and more.
The page is easily accessed using only one web address, so it is easy for students who may have difficulty with the keyboard or spelling to remember and type it.
It can be customized to be easy to read and as colorful or colorless as desired.
Attention deficit disorder is a “neurological syndrome defined by the classical triad of symptoms as impulsivity, easy perturbation, and hyperactivity or hyperenergism.”
It is not a learning disability, it is a learning disorder, which "applies to 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps even as many as 2 million American children".
Children with attention deficit find it difficult to focus on something like school, but they are able to focus on things that sting, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing punctuated sentences.
These children often get into trouble because they "behave riskyly, get into fights and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brains, as their brains cannot be stimulated by the usual means.
Attention deficit affects peer relationships because other children don’t understand why they behave or talk the way they speak, or why they are at different levels of maturity.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn changed in the manner mentioned above, the basic level of acquiring knowledge changed.
The approach to acquiring information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual memory, but instead began to focus more on the ability to remember text.
In essence, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, large human monkeys no longer use their hands to move, hold weight, or move around trees by swinging themselves.
The chimpanzee's hand and leg are of the same size and length, suggesting that weight is reserved for the hand in the backhand walk.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, and its finger bones are more straight.
Fossils of hand bones aged between two and three million years reveal the specialization of the hand from the movement of this change to the use.
Some believe that seeing too many artificially produced lucid dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the extension of the periods between REM stages as a result of lucid dreams.
When there are fewer REM stages during the night, the condition in which the body actually sleeps and during which the body recovers becomes so irregular that the issue becomes a problem.
It’s just as exhausting as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times your brain tries to see a lucid dream.
A week after the Italian declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the 11th Hussar Regiment of the British Army had captured Capuzzo fort in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, chief of the Italian 10th Army Pioneer Corps.
Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and a possible successor to Mussolini, died on 28 June under fire from his own forces while disembarking in Tobruk.
Fencing is practiced as a modern sport on many different levels, from university students to professional competitions and the Olympic Games.
The sport is mostly practiced as a duel by one swordsman against another.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls in holes.
In a regular round, eighteen holes are played so that players usually start at the first hole of the track and finish at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least number of strokes to complete the track wins.
The game is played on the lawn. The grass around the hole is driven shorter, and is called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that which most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
In it, people leave their own regular everyday life to a very different place to relax and have fun.
Sand beaches, amusement parks and campsites are often the most popular places for recreational tourists.
If the purpose of a visit to a particular place is to get acquainted with its history and culture, then that type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different destinations in a particular country, or they may focus on just one area.
The colonists had also called for reinforcements when they saw this happen.
The troops strengthening their positions of advantage included two hundred-man 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became general).
Stark's men took positions next to the fence at the north end of the colonists station.
When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence northward with a short stone wall that ended by water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark sunk a pole about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one be allowed to fire until it had been passed by British soldiers.
The American plan was based on the start of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was to launch a diversionary attack on the British garrison of Bordentown to cut off the road from any reinforcements.
General James Erwing would take 700 soldiers across the river at the Trenton Ferry, take over the bridge across Assunpink Creek, and prevent enemy forces from escaping.
The main force of attackers, 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one led by Greene and the other by Sullivan, to launch the attack before dawn.
When moving from a quarter mile to a half mile run, the importance of speed is greatly reduced, and durability becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a man with a time of less than two minutes, must be quite fast, but also endurance must be developed by all means.
The best preparation for the running season is some cross-country running during the winter combined with upper body gym exercises.
Proper nutrition practices alone are not capable of delivering elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits and understanding the different aspects of dietary supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy sports more.
Mid-distance running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions about the small means needed to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel more comfortable with a product, even if it is of no real use.
Atom can be considered as one of the fundamental components of all matter.
It is a very complex entity and consists of a central core, according to Bohr's simplified model, which electrons orbit a little bit like the planets orbit the sun (see Figure 1.1).
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
The electrical charge of the protons is positive, the neutrons have no charge. The electric charge of the electrons is negative.
Make sure the location is safe before you check the injured person’s condition.
As you approach the injured person, note his or her position, as well as other obvious signs of danger.
If you hurt yourself while helping, you may only make things worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophe acted as mediators for the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only those affected by the effects of the disaster were allowed to participate in weekly structured physical activity sessions. Suffering from depression and fear was not a sufficient condition.
Participants in regular activities needed more support for negative perception of pain to distinguish chronic pain from a feeling of discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
The sense of sight, or ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system, i.e. the eyes.
There are several different structures of the eye, and their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different abilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and their sharpness varies. They also need a different processing pen to interpret the seen input and different amounts to work as well as possible.
Population is the sum of organisms of a given species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical to a particular phenotypic property, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show multiple variations of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Wanderer ant colonies also marched and nested at different stages.
In the hiking phase, the wandering ants march at night and stop for a day at the camp.
The community begins the hiking phase when the available food is reduced. During this phase, the community makes temporary nests, which change daily.
Each of these hiking battles or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell used in many languages comes from the Latin word "cella", which means a small room. It was developed by a microscope user who studied the structure of a cork.
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and essential to the study of life that they are often called the building blocks of life.
The nervous system preserves homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood flow running and undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent really quickly throughout the body, keeping it safe from potential threats.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other storms, but they can destroy anything in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, remove boards from houses, and throw cars into the sky. The most violent two percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
Winds from these giant storms can reach up to 480 kilometres per hour (133 metres per second or 300 miles per hour).
Humans have been making and using lenses to enlarge for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first actual telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
The telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make the objects appear to be both closer and larger.
There will always be greed and selfishness, and it is also characteristic of cooperation that, when acting in the interests of the majority, in the short term, selfish action will bring the most benefit to the individual.
Hopefully, most people will understand that in the long run, their best option is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some wonder what there is there. Some believe that other planets may have alien beings or other life.
If this ever happens, however, it will probably not be for a long time. The stars are so distant from each other that the distance between the "neighboring stars" is trillions of miles.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand in an unknown world and reflect on their ancient ancestors.
Animals are made up of many cells, eating food and digesting it inside them, and most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains (though not all animals have brains, for example jellyfish do not have brains).
Animals can be found in every corner of the world, digging into the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism (a living being).
In many languages, the origin of the word cell is in the Latin word cella, which means small room.
If you look at living creatures under a microscope, you will see them made up of small squares or balls.
The English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in the cap as he looked at it under a microscope.
They looked like rooms, and he was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change from one state to another and still not change.
Gaseous nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure as gas, liquid and solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, but it’s still hard to understand.
Practitioners of religion, philosophy and science have studied the time for thousands of years.
We experience as a series of events from the future through the present to the past.
We also use time to compare the duration of events.
The passage of time can be observed by observing how a cyclic event repeats itself. A cyclic event is one that happens regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to process images and videos.
Advanced animations can be made on a computer, and such animations are increasingly used on television and in movies.
Often, music is recorded using advanced computers to process sounds and mix sounds together.
The first inhabitants of New Zealand were long believed to have been Maori in the 19th and 20th centuries, hunting giant birds called Moa.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia as a so-called large fleet, took over New Zealand from the Morior, and established an agricultural society.
However, in the light of new evidence, it appears that the Moriori were a group of Maori living on the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and formed their own peaceful culture there.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands, Maori who had moved out of New Zealand.
They called themselves the Moriori. There were a few clashes, and eventually the Moriori were completely exterminated
The people who had been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while at the same time valuing our difficulties and even our failures.
When we listened to individuals sharing their own and family and business stories, we gained valuable insights into the past and certain individuals who had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
While understanding one’s own history does not require an understanding of culture, it at least helps people get a sense of their own place in the history of the organization.
Individuals and all participants as a whole become more familiar with the values, tasks and driving forces of the organization when assessing successes and becoming more aware of failures.
In this case, remembering past cases of entrepreneurial behavior and the subsequent success helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced fear of change and created positive perceptions of future changes.
Convergent thinking models are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or fields to find a solution.
At the heart of this mindset are speed, logic and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of existing technologies, and data collection.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer; think only of two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is combined with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this mindset think logically, are able to memorize repetitive patterns, solve problems and work on scientific experiments.
Humans are by far the most gifted species when it comes to reading other people’s thoughts.
In other words, we are able to successfully predict what other people understand, mean, believe, know or want.
In addition to these skills, it is very important to understand the intentions of other people. In this way, we can solve the possible ambiguity of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you’re probably assuming they’re trying to steal a stranger’s car.
His actions need to be assessed differently if he has lost his car keys and tries to break into his own car.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (while working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (at Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit very small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered how MRI can be used to make medical diagnoses.
The patent was granted four years later, the first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Damadian completed his first "whole body" magnetic resonance imaging device, which he named Indomitable, indomitable.
Nonsynchronous communication allows time to think and react to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of the instructions received.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints and flexible working hours are possible (Bremer 1998).
The use of the Internet and online content allows learners to access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to instructors at any time of the day and receive relatively quick answers instead of waiting for their next meeting face-to-face.
A postmodern approach to learning frees you from absolutes. There is not just one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not even one good thing to learn. Learning is an experience between the learner and the information presented.
Our current experience of all do-it-yourself programmes and information-giving, learning-based television programmes illustrates the issue.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television program that tells us about a process or experience in which we never participate or make use of this information.
We never repair a car, build a fountain in the backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins or renovate a neighbor's house.
Thanks to the subsea fibre cable connections and broadband satellite that exports to Europe, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (if you stay in a guest house or private home) are likely to have WiFi or a computer connected to the Internet, and in all settlements there is an Internet café or a place with a public WiFi network.
As mentioned above, although the word Eskimo is still accepted in the United States, many Arctic nations outside the United States, especially Canada, consider it demeaning.
You may hear Greenland natives use this word, but foreigners should still avoid using it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada, and in Greenland they use the word Kalalleq (plural fishalls), Greenlandic.
In Greenland, crime and bad intentions towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown, not even in cities.
Cold weather may be the only real danger the unprepared face.
If you are visiting Greenland during the cold season (also bearing in mind that the northern parts are the coldest), it is essential to bring enough warm clothing.
The long days of summer can cause trouble getting enough sleep and related health problems.
In the summer, you should also watch out for mosquitoes. Although they do not carry diseases, they can be annoying.
Although the economy of San Francisco is linked to its position as a world-class tourist destination, its economy is very diverse.
The main employers are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
The city’s frequent appearance in music, movies, literature and popular culture has made it and its landmarks familiar to people around the world.
San Francisco has developed an extensive tourist infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants, and state-of-the-art exhibition centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to explore other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many families in the United States.
A typical visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel in the amusement park area, a stay of about a week without leaving Disney land, and then returning home.
There are an endless number of different implementation options, but this is what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disney World".
Many of the tickets sold through internet auctions such as eBay or Craigslist are multi-day, multi-park valid tickets that have already been partially used.
This is very common, but Disney has banned it: tickets cannot be transferred to another person.
Camping below the edge of the Grand Canyon requires a camping permit.
The number of permits is limited to protect the canyon and will become available on the first day of the month four months before the starting month.
In other words, a camping permit for the May start date will be available on January 1.
Places in the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel campsite next to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled as early as the first day when they open for reservations.
A limited number of permits are reserved for those arriving without reservation, which are issued in the order of arrival.
Traveling to South Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the whole area and get to places outside of the usual tourist routes.
It can be done with a regular car, if the trip is carefully planned, but four-wheel drive is highly recommended, and many destinations can only be reached with a four-wheel drive vehicle with high ground clearance.
When planning your trip, remember that while the situation in South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and costs vary from country to country, and your country of origin is affected.
Each country also has its own laws on what mandatory equipment to have in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe. Livingstone is across the border in Zambia, and Botswana is also nearby.
The city is located right next to the falls and is the main attraction. Still, the popular tourist destination offers adventurers and sightseeing enthusiasts plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water is higher and the falls look more dramatic.
You will surely get wet if you cross a bridge or walk along winding paths in the vicinity of the falls.
On the other hand, you still don’t see the falls well, all that water is blocking you!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of all the tombs in the valley, where Howard Carter in 1922 discovered the almost untouched royal tomb of the young Pharaoh.
Compared to most other royal tombs, however, the tomb of Tutankhamun is barely worth a visit because it is much smaller and less decorated.
Anyone who wants to see traces of the damage to the mummy when trying to remove it from their coffin will be disappointed because only its head and shoulders are visible.
The great riches of the tomb are no longer in their former place, but have been taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time should spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple on the top of the hill was built at the end of the 8th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dim atmosphere of the temple and the view over Tonle Sap Lake make climbing the hill worth the effort.
The trip to the place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
An Angkor passport is required to enter the temple, so don’t forget to bring your country’s passport with you when you head to Tonle Sap Lake.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city of the Judean hills has a fascinating history that has been going on for thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Because of its religious significance, and especially because of the many sights in the Old City, Jerusalem is one of Israel’s most important tourist destinations.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as shopping centers, cafes and restaurants full of life and people.
Ecuador insists that Cuban citizens have received an invitation letter before arriving in Ecuador via international airports or ground checkpoints.
The Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry must legalize the letter and meet certain requirements.
The requirements are intended to make the migration flow between countries systematic.
Cuban citizens holding U.S. employment and residence permits must visit the Ecuadorian consulate in order to be exempted from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the trip. To prove the length of stay, a return ticket or a connecting ticket is required.
Sightseeing tours are cheaper for large groups, so if you are traveling alone or with just one friend, try to get to know other people and form a group of 4-5 people for a better individual price.
However, you probably won’t have to worry about this, as travelers are often moved from one car to another to fill all the seats.
It seems to be more of a way of tricking people into believing that they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of photographs taken from the ruins.
It looks a little daunting from below, and the climb is steep and difficult, but those in reasonably good condition should cope with it in about 45 minutes.
The path is mostly covered with stone steps, and the steeper points are supported by a handrail made of steel wire.
Nevertheless, one can expect to be out of breath, and on steeper sections one should be careful, especially in wet weather, as the path can quickly become dangerous.
There's a small cave near the top that you have to go through, and it's quite shallow and quite cramped.
The sights and fauna of the Galapagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships operate in the waters of the Galapagos Islands, ranging in size from eight to 100 passengers.
Most people book their seats well in advance (since the ships are usually full during peak season).
Make sure that the officer through whom you make the booking is a Galapagos expert who knows a lot about the different types of ships.
This will ensure that you find the best vessel to match your interests and/or limitations.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, and the indigenous Araucans (Mapuches) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuches were also one of America's last independent indigenous peoples and had not been fully subjected to Spanish-speaking rule before Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars that left Spain without a functioning central government for a few years), the final victory over Spain was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that forms the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola that it shared with Haiti.
Along with white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country has the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
Taikos and Caribs were the first inhabitants of the island. The Caribs were an Arawak-speaking people who had come to the island around 10,000 BC.
Spanish conquerors had significantly reduced the population of the Tainos within just a few years of the arrival of European explorers.
According to Dominican brother Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 tainos between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. The estate was built as an atrium in a 17th-century monastery with the only remaining building being the Templo de San Diego.
It now serves as a central square, and there is always a lot of hustle and bustle around the clock.
Several restaurants surround the garden, and on many afternoons and evenings free concerts are held in the main amusement house.
Callejon del Beso (Kiss alley). Two balconies, just 69 centimeters apart, tell an old love story.
The children tell the whole story in exchange for a few coins.
Bowen Island is a popular day and weekend destination with kayak rowing, camping, shops, restaurants and more.
The authentic community is located near Howensalme, near Vancouver, and is easy to reach by regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For outdoor enthusiasts, a trip to the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky Corridor is an absolute must.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive but famous thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In the winter, you can enjoy some of the best skiing conditions in North America, and in the summer, you can try real mountain biking.
Permissions must be reserved in advance. A permit is required to stay at Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station offering accommodation in dormitories and warm meals in addition to camping. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food services.
Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forest Management Centre, but you cannot pay by credit card
The Park Service (MINAE) issues park permits no more than one month before the intended arrival time.
CafeNet El Sol offers a booking service for US$30 or day tickets for $10. For more details, see its Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island nation in Polynesia, in the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands in an oceanic area of more than 2.2 million square kilometres.
Because the islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes called Hawaii of the Southern Hemisphere.
Although smaller than Hawaii, they remind some elderly visitors of Hawaii before it became a state and, above all, of major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have a single town, but consist of fifteen different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today’s developed countries, offering luxury bed & breakfasts has been made into some form of art.
Of course, the best bed and breakfast establishments compete mainly in two main areas: accommodation and breakfast.
So, at best, such places may have really luxurious sleeping conditions, such as a handmade blanket or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies or a host's bravour.
The environment can be an old historic building with antique furniture, trimmed lawns and swimming pools.
Getting into your own car and going on a long trip is naturally attractive in all its simplicity.
You are probably already familiar with driving your own car, and you know its limitations, unlike those of large vehicles.
Setting up a tent in a private area or city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, your own car is suitable for car travel, but less often it can be used for actual camping.
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with a horizontal bench.
Some of the hotels date from the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, from the 19th century or early 20th century, before World War II.
Rich and famous people of their time stayed in these hotels, often serving gourmet food and nightlife.
The old-fashioned framework, the lack of the most modern comforts and a certain dignified old age are also part of their nature.
They are usually privately owned, but are sometimes housed by visiting heads of state and other prominent figures.
A traveler with piles of money could consider a round-the-world flight, which would be rhythmized by visits to several of these hotels.
The Hospitality Network is an organization that connects tourists to local residents in the cities they intend to visit.
Such a network can usually only be joined by filling out an online form, although some networks provide or require additional confirmation.
The list of available hosts is then held on paper and/or online and sometimes includes recommendations and reviews from other travelers.
CouchSurfing was founded in January 2004 when computer programmer Casey Fenton discovered a cheap flight to Iceland, but he did not have a place to stay.
He emailed students from the local university and received a huge amount of offers for free accommodation.
The hostels are mainly for young tourists - the typical guest is in their twenties - but you can often find older tourists.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels welcome them in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will host the Winter Olympics in 2022, thus becoming the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Opening and graduation ceremonies and indoor ice events are held in Beijing.
Other ski events will be held in the Taizicheng ski area of Zhangjiakou, located about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
In most temples, an annual festival takes place between the end of November and the middle of May. The date depends on the annual calendar of each temple.
Most temple festivals are held as part of its anniversary, in honor of the birthday of the temple's supreme deity, or in connection with any other important event related to the temple.
The Kerala Temple Festivals are really interesting to watch, as they include elephants decorated as a regular procession, a temple orchestra, and other celebrations.
The World Exposition (sometimes also the Expo) is a major international art and science event.
The participating countries organise artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions that highlight global issues or the culture and history of their own country.
International garden exhibitions are specialized events that highlight floral arrangements, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although they can theoretically be arranged every year (as long as they are held in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
Such events normally last from three to six months and take place in areas of at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, several different film types have been used. A standard 35 mm film (36 × 24 mm negative) is by far the most common.
The new is usually easily replaced if it runs out, and its resolution is more or less comparable to today’s digital SLR cameras.
Some medium-sized film cameras use a 6 × 6 cm image size, more specifically a 56 × 56 mm negative.
As a result, the resolution is almost four times that of the 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 vs. 864).
Wild animals are one of the most challenging subjects for a photographer, and their successful shooting requires good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Wild animals are often taken for granted, but, as with photography in general, a picture is worth a thousand words.
A long remote lens is often required to photograph wild animals, but other lenses are needed to photograph some objects, such as flocks of birds and tiny animals.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules for taking pictures for commercial purposes.
Wild animals may be either sensitive or aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot or otherwise unpleasant.
More than 5,000 languages are spoken worldwide, with more than 20 having at least 50 million speakers.
Similarly, a printed word is often easier to understand than a spoken word. This is especially true for street addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce understandably.
Many whole nations speak English fluently, and even more people can expect at least limited knowledge, especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, a Manchesterer, a Bostoner, a Jamaican, and a Sydneyer dine at a table at a Toronto restaurant.
They entertain each other with stories about their home towns and narrate them with their own accents and local slang.
Buying food at a supermarket is usually the cheapest way to be nourished. Without cooking options, however, options are limited to ready-made food.
The selection of ready-made meals in supermarkets is becoming more and more diverse. Some even have a microwave oven or other ways to heat food.
In some countries or types of shops, there is at least one restaurant, often quite casual and affordable.
Take copies of your insurance and keep your contact details with you.
They must show the insurer’s e-mail address and international telephone numbers for advice or authorization and for making claims.
Keep one copy with your luggage and online (send it to yourself as an e-mail attachment or in the cloud).
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, keep one copy in its memory or on a disk (available without internet connection).
Please also provide copies of your insurance and contact information to your travelers and relatives or friends who are willing to help.
Moose are not naturally aggressive, but defend themselves when they suspect danger.
When people do not feel that elk are potentially dangerous, they may approach them too much and put themselves in danger.
Enjoy alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know your own limits.
The long-term effects of excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death.
Illegal spirits can contain a variety of dangerous contaminants, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
You should get an eye examination at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and take the prescription with you to pick it up elsewhere.
Luxury brand frames from such areas may have two problems: some may be fake, and the right imported frames may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the world’s top-selling commodities, and you’ll probably be able to find many different types in your neighborhood.
Nevertheless, there are many unique coffee-drinking habits in different parts of the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning means going to the bottom of a canyon, either dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping, but getting started requires relatively little training or physical fitness (compared to rock climbing, tool diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor hobby that consists of walking in a natural environment, often on hiking trails.
Day hikes are distances that range from less than a mile to longer distances if they can be traveled within a single day.
Day hiking on an easy route requires very little preparation and is suitable for anyone in reasonable condition.
People with small children may need more preparation, but a day out is easy to do, even with babies and toddlers.
There are nearly 200 running organisations that organise city tours worldwide, most of them operating independently.
The successor to the Global Running Tours, Go Running Tours, is a network of dozens of attraction runners operating on four continents.
It originated with the Barcelona Running Tours Barcelona and the Copenhagen Running Copenhagen, and was quickly joined by the Prague Running Tours Prague.
You need to take a number of things into account both before you travel somewhere and when you travel.
When traveling, do not expect things to be the same as at home. Habits, laws, food, transport, accommodation, quality levels, language, etc. differ to some extent from those in your place of residence.
This should always be kept in mind to avoid disappointment or perhaps even aversion to local practices.
Travel agencies have existed since the 19th century. A travel agency is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond a traveler’s previous experience of nature, cultures, languages or low-income countries.
While most travel agencies are happy to accept most regular reservations, many specialize in specific types of travel, price ranges, or destinations.
It may be better to use an official who often book trips similar to those you plan to do.
Check either the website or the shop window to see what kind of trips the representative offers.
If you want to see the world cheaply - whether it's because of necessity, lifestyle, or the fact that you're looking for a challenge - there are ways to do that.
In practice, they fall into two categories: you can either work while traveling or try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and predictability to reduce costs near zero, see Minimum Budget Travel.
The advice assumes that tourists do not steal, invade unauthorized places, act in the black market, beg, or otherwise exploit people.
An entry checkpoint is usually the first stop after leaving an aircraft, ship or other means of transport.
On some international trains, checks are carried out while the train is in motion and you must have a valid identity card with you when boarding such a train.
On night trains, the conductor may collect passports so you don’t have to disturb your sleep.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa procedure. In some countries, you need to provide the local authorities with your arrival and the address at which you are staying.
The requirements may include filling in the form at the local police station or visiting the immigration office.
In many countries where such a law is in force, local hotels take care of the registration process (you should ask for confirmation).
In other cases, only those staying outside the tourist accommodation are required to register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so it is advisable to find out in advance.
Architecture is all about the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a travel destination is often an attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or from an inventively positioned window can be eye-catching.
Architecture has considerable overlap with other fields such as urban planning, building engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how remote several pueblos are located, you won’t find a more notable nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them also offer branded entertainment (especially the biggest casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: bars in small towns are not always the best place to spend time here.
First, drunk driving is a major problem in the northern part of New Mexico, and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is considerable near small-town bars.
Wall paintings or scratches that are unwanted are known as graffiti.
While this is certainly not a new phenomenon, most likely associate it with the vandalization of public and private property by young people with spray paints.
However, today there are already established graffiti artists, graffiti events and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble art instead of illegible tags.
Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it returns to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for this purpose.
Most boomerangs available in Australia do not actually return. Beginners better not try throwing in the winds
The hangi meal is prepared in a hot ground pit.
The pit is heated either by hot stones taken from the fire, or in some places geothermal heat heats some points in the soil naturally.
Hang is often used to prepare a traditional grill-style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer a ground-heated hang. Other types of hang can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes for commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called first grade) and Metro (called third grade).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less cramped, but it is a bit more expensive. On the other hand, it is still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro cars. MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train on the Cape Town side.
Taking on behalf of others - Never let your bags out of sight, especially when crossing borders.
You may find yourself unknowingly being a drug smuggler, causing you serious problems.
It involves standing in line, as drug dogs can be used at any time without a separate warning.
In some countries, even first-timers are subject to extremely severe penalties, such as prison sentences of more than 10 years or death.
Unattended bags are vulnerable to theft and can also attract attention from authorities who are on alert due to bomb threats.
You are very likely to be immune to the bacteria in your home area because you are constantly exposed to them.
But in other parts of the world, whose bacterial strain is unknown to you, you are much more likely to face problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
And thus comes travel diarrhea, or Delhi's stomach, Pharaoh's curse, the vengeance of Montezuma, and their many different friends.
Like respiratory problems in cold climates, intestinal problems in hot climates are quite common and in most cases unquestionably embarrassing but not actually dangerous.
If you are traveling for the first time in a developing country —or in a previously unknown part of the world —do not underestimate the possibility of cultural shock.
The novelty of developing world tourism has surprised many routine and skilled tourists. In world tourism, small cultural adjustments have to be made all the time.
Especially in the first days, it is worth spending time on hotels, food and services that represent Western style and quality in order to facilitate adaptation.
Do not sleep on the ground on a mattress or bed in places whose fauna you do not know.
If you plan to camp outdoors, bring a field bed or hammock to stay out of the reach of snakes and scorpions and the like.
Enjoy rich coffee in the morning and relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
When you’re on vacation, you’ll have time to pamper yourself and spend a few extra minutes simmering something special.
If you feel more adventurous, take advantage of the opportunity and juice or mix a couple of smoothies:
You can find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars or pubs in areas where you don’t frequent.
For those who are not familiar with medical vocabulary, the words infectious disease and infectious disease have a different meaning.
Infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacteria, fungus or other parasite.
An infectious disease is one that spreads easily by being close to an infected person.
Many authorities require visitors or residents leaving the country to be vaccinated against a variety of diseases.
The requirements may often depend on the countries in which the visitor has visited or intends to visit.
One of the good things about Charlotte, North Carolina, is that there are plenty of high-quality options for families with children.
Residents from other areas often cite family-friendliness as the primary reason for moving to the city, and many visitors find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of options suitable for children outside the heart of Charlotte has increased exponentially.
Families do not usually use taxis in Charlotte, but they can be useful in some situations.
More than two passengers are charged an additional fee, so the option may be unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounded by the South Pole.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place during the summer time from November to February, and are mainly limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand staff members live in about fifty bases in Antarctica during the summer, mainly in these areas, a small number of them living over the winter.
The inner part of Antarctica is a deserted plain, covered by a layer of ice that is two to three kilometres thick.
Sometimes inland is reached by specialized air tours for mountain climbing or for traveling to the pole.
The South Pole Road is a 1,600 km route to the pole from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea shore.
It is a dense snow with cracks filled and marked with flags. The route can only be travelled by special tractors, which pull behind them sleds containing fuel and supplies.
These are not very agile, so the route has to take a long bend around the Trans-Antarctic Mountains to reach the plain.
The most common cause of winter accidents is the slipperyness of roads, sidewalks and especially stairs.
At the very least, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery over ice and snow, and some winter shoes are lacking.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough for cold temperatures.
Some shoes have studs, and studded skids are available for slippery conditions, which fit most shoes and boots. They are attached either to the heel and sole or only to the heel.
The heel should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads and paths to improve grip.
Avalanchees are not unusual. The steep slopes can only support a certain amount of snow, and the amount above it descends as an avalanche.
The problem is the stickyness of the snow, so it needs a stimulus to come down. And when some of the snow comes down, it may act as a stimulus to the rest of the snow.
Sometimes the event is triggered by the beginning of snow warming in the sun, sometimes by snowfall, sometimes by other natural events, often by man.
A tornado is a rotating column of extremely low-pressure air that absorbs the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They produce strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, taking them along with the tornado.
They originate from storm clouds down as future funnels and become tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Personal VPN providers are a great way to circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP geo-filtering.
They are superior to proxy servers for several reasons: they reroute all internet traffic, not just http traffic.
Their bandwidth is often higher and the service quality is better. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
Media companies lie about its purpose routinely, claiming it is "preventing illegal copying".
In fact, regional codes have no effect on illegal copying: an identical copy of the disc works just as well on the same devices as the original.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets — it’s all about making money.
Since calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use the telephone operator of your place of residence or destination.
You don't have to get a phone number for where you live. You can get an Internet connection via satellite from the Chicken Wilderness Salons in Alaska and pick a number to pretend to be in Arizona's sunshine.
Often, you need to buy a global number separately to call you on phones on the telephone network. Where the number comes from matters to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications — applications capable of translating entire paragraphs of text from one language to another.
Some apps in this category can even translate foreign language text from signs or other real-world objects when the user points to them on their smartphone.
The translation machines have improved considerably and now give a somewhat correct translation (and less and less often gibberish), but caution is worthwhile, as even complete error is still possible.
One of the most notable applications in this category is Google Translator, which allows offline translation when data from the desired language is uploaded to the device.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you’re not in your home country.
It can save you money compared to buying new maps for GPS tracking, buying a completely new GPS device or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone has no data connection or is outside the range of the data connection, their performance may be limited or non-existent.
Each corner kiosk has a confusing selection of prepaid call cards that can be used for payphones or regular phones.
Most cards are valid for any call, but some specialize in providing affordable calls to specific groups of countries.
Often these services are used from toll-free telephone numbers, which can be called from most phones free of charge.
Ordinary photography rules also apply to video photography, perhaps even more so.
If taking a picture of something is not allowed, you should not even consider taking a video.
If you plan to use the drone, check well in advance what you are allowed to photograph and what permits or other licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it’s not illegal in your area.
Today, air travel is rarely booked directly from the airline before first searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the prices for the same flight may differ significantly from one another on different aggregate search sites, and you should compare the search results and also look at the airline’s own website before making a booking.
While some countries do not require a visa for short tourist or business trips, going there as an international student often requires a longer stay than as an occasional tourist.
Generally speaking, spending a longer period of time in any foreign country requires obtaining a visa in advance.
Student visas are usually subject to different requirements and application processes than tourist and work visas.
In most countries, you will need a letter from the institution where you want to study, and you will also have to prove that you can afford to support yourself at least during your first year of study.
Check the detailed requirements of the educational institution and the immigration authorities of the country of study of your choice.
Unless you are a diplomat, working abroad usually means you have to pay income tax in your country of residence.
Income tax is formed in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax categories vary greatly from country to country.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at both federal and local levels, so tax rates and categories can vary from region to region.
While when you return to your country of origin, an entry check is usually either missing or a mere formality, a customs check can be a hassle.
Make sure you know what you can and can’t import, and customs all legal import limits will be exceeded.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing industry is to hone your skills with an established travel blog site.
As you learn how to format and edit online, you can later create your own website.
Volunteering during travel is a good way to bring about change, but it’s not just about giving.
Living abroad as a volunteer is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn things about yourself, develop a sense of proportion and even gather new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer work involves food and maintenance, and some are even paid a small salary.
The Vikings used Russian water routes to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check for any special permits that may be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via Onego, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly along rivers and lakes.
Lake Onego is also connected to Volga, so it is still possible to get there from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
You can be sure that when you get to the marina, everything is quite self-evident. You will meet other boat hitchhikers, and they will share their knowledge with you.
In practice, you put in advertisements where you offer help, wander around shipyards, approach people who clean their yachts, try to chat with sailors in a bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. Soon everyone will know you and give tips on which boat you need assistants.
You should carefully choose which of the companies in the airline alliance you choose for your loyalty program.
While you may think it makes sense to become a frequent flyer of the airline you fly with the most, you should know that the privileges offered often differ, and frequent flyer can get more generously from another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa and offer connecting connections to many of Africa's major cities at a more competitive price than European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries (as of 2014).
If you have extra travel time, you should check how the total price of an African trip compares to the price of a round-the-world trip.
Don’t forget to add extras from additional visas, airport taxis, land transport, etc. in all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world on the Southern Hemisphere side alone, selectable flights and destinations are limited due to the lack of intercontinental routes.
No airline alliance covers the crossing of all three oceans in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover the first of them).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern part of the South Pacific between Santiago de Chile and Tahiti. It is a Oneworld flight with LATAM.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the western coast of the South Pacific and South America (see below).
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis.
With the support of the Armenians, a new republic was created, and it is not officially recognised by any established state, even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over control of the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Channel District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century district surrounding Amsterdam's Binnenstad.
The entire area has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value, and the prices of its properties are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, which means five countries, consists of five small coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in rough and steep terrain right up to the cliffs of the seashore.
The lack of visible commercialisation is part of its charm: trails, trains and ships connect villages, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The French forms spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, but are similar enough to be intelligible.
The French-speaking Belgian and Swiss numeral systems in particular have subtle peculiarities that differ from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words differs slightly.
However, everyone in Belgium and Switzerland who speaks French has learned standard French at school, so they will understand you even if you use a normal French numbering system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means greeting.
However, in Malaysia, and at least among rural Malaysians, it means "come here" a bit like a gesture in some Western countries where the index finger is bent towards the body, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may confuse a wave of goodbye with a palm facing the waver (and not the waver) as a request to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or artificial languages created to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with each other.
They are different from the lingua franca, i.e. natural or organic languages, which for one reason or another have risen to a dominant position as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
Travelers may see mirages in the heat of the day that create an illusion of water (or something else).
They can be dangerous if the traveler is striving towards mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can be extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothing.
Especially in summer, you need to be careful about mosquitoes if you decide to go hiking through the rainforest.
Even if you drive through a subtropical rainforest, opening the doors for a few seconds when you get into the vehicle is enough for mosquitoes to get into the car with you.
Avian influenza can be transmitted to both birds and mammals.
Fewer than a thousand cases have been recorded in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most people who work with poultry have joined, but birders are also slightly exposed.
The steep fjords and valleys, which suddenly turn into a somewhat flat massif, are typical of Norway.
These plains are often referred to as vidde, meaning a vast and open woodless area, an unbounded plain.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are usually referred to as hello, meaning treeless, often heather-covered moor.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountainside, causing cracks and cracks that may remain covered with snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice caves may collapse and the cracks may close.
At the edges of the glaciers, huge boulders fall off, fall, and may pop or roll further from the edges.
The tourist season of mountain stations is usually at its peak during the summer in India.
In winter, however, there is a variety of beauty and charm as many mountain stations get brisk snow and offer opportunities for activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer so-called mourning fares, which makes last-minute funeral trips a little cheaper.
These airlines include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the United States and Canada, and Westjet.
In all cases, the reservation must be made by phone directly with the airline.
