Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness and now she is making art on the subject - "A person should have a right to his own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project room.
They all have Camille Auer's name on them.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
“I wanted to tell you about my person-specific treatment history so that the violence in the process would become visible,” Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the process of gender correction.
It is often a period of years of research involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with a referral to diagnose studies of "gender identity disorder" carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered over the internet and was already very advanced in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must undergo a correction process in order to be able to correct gender legally.
The Trans Act, or Act on the Confirmation of the Gender of Transsec Sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to sterilize so that the correct gender can be obtained, for example, in the Population Register Centre and in the passport.
At present, every person who corrects their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of reproductive incapacity.
People have the right to decide their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Trans Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and the European Court of Justice has a precedent that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
Finland’s previous government prepared an amendment to the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election and the Finns Party came to the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
These are domestic disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government over the amendment of the law,” says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient record installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a transpolitan psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these wrote a story that would define Auer's right to treatment and assistance.
The sense of the reality under study appears to be exposed to wavering.
The subject’s perception of themselves appears to be fragmented at the borderline level, and the unstable features related to personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex-repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the waiting lobby of the transpoly.
Later, an artwork called Monument for the Excluded emerged from that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that any person who is defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove their breasts,” Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel that you are anything other than the number of genders you are born with.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is more difficult for many for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who need support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources aren't enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have mental symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of bullying.
Based on this, the medical professional may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer’s personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer wrote: “I’ve had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that’s something that people usually find difficult to digest.”
The depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, it made me feel better.
He had finally been able to write down the feelings that had existed in childhood and in his teens.
The reason why the wide jaw didn’t seem to fit into your body and why your chest muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using voice and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer feels like she is already being seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the random comments of loved ones could hurt a lot.
What hurts the most is when people close to you are mis-sexed.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't agree or be able to internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transgender people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, where the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a lengthy research process, there can be no official confirmation of one’s own sex.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal gender.
The adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating in it that he/she feels that he/she is of the other sex.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant will confirm his/her application in writing and the Ministry will assign the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and the Auer exhibition also crystallizes this demand.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a collection of political and artistic works.
I want to believe that art still holds weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil Rights Organization Issues Travel Warning to Missouri
The African-American Civil Rights National Association (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
"NAACP's travel bulletin for Missouri comes into effect on August 28, 2017, and calls on African-American tourists, visitors, and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when travelling in a state that has recently experienced numerous questionable racial events," the organization said in a statement.
A law that recently came into force in Missouri makes it more difficult to bring cases of discrimination to justice. In addition, enforcement of state laws is disproportionately directed against minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of skin color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases before in such a short time."
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization's first warning regarding the state of the United States.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by Missouri police even though he was not charged with the crime.
According to a report by the Missouri Attorney General, police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white driver.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by taking money with them to bail out or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, the sixteenth highest number of states in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law that makes it harder to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, a civil rights organization that supports constitutionally guaranteed rights, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws obliging police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and concern other states, but have recently been published by NGOs in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (center) responsible for state ownership steering has asked Finnair for an explanation of the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is contrary to the state’s will.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary bonus received by Vauramo came to the fore this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s corporate governance decision.
The sanctions immediately increased the number of speeches
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were moving from cold to warm.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met at the G20 summit in Hamburg, seemed to get along well.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were bitterly reacted to in Russia.
The most stunning response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions bill signed by Trump means a "full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian reaction is only offset by political rhetorical escalations and excesses, the tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon after Trump’s election.
In the United States, the passage of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although Congress passed the bill with considerable unanimity, the president said it was much more difficult to pass the bill.
Trump recently criticized the bill he signed as “significantly flawed.”
The reason for President Trump’s unease must have been Russia in particular, even though the adoption of a law that restricts his own powers must have been repugnant.
As is well known, the US is under investigation for possible Russian interference in the presidential election as well as for the Trump campaign’s links with Russia.
The tightening of relations between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandalous twists have been revealed almost to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not made in the United States under the leadership of the President but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is complex in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united, at least on the surface, in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland that does a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The effects of the recent US sanctions law are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion from sanctions of liquid natural gas ing, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means of showing disapproval in world politics.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and precise.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House has a Statue of Liberty
Intervening in statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know this as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, knocked down Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists in the Trump administration, was well aware of what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta.
Miller did not actually criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the importance of the statue and especially the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal — 17 years after the statue was completed.
“I don’t want to go into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller wasn’t wrong, but it’s not just history, as he said.
The key words of Lazarus are: “Your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your Teeming shore.”
The poem is now more topical than ever.
Miller was by no means engaged in literary criticism. He made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal, well aware that the act was strongly political.
The statue was intended to embody the connections between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Linking the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh — a mouthpiece who can now be regarded as some kind of omen of Trump — claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, taking the torch of the United States into a world covered by darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not point the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and weary but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
That’s not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch does not point the way, but kindles the flames of hatred, their only source of strength.
Athletics World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made the Great Britain national team
Neil Black, the result director of the UK Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Cup are "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland "there is something special happening" that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it until we understand what's going on," Black says.
"I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Association of Athletics believes that it is related to the activities of the Association,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that their activities are behind it.
And the average guy on the street thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it is something wonderful, whatever it is.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-meter race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the national team.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the Commonwealth Championships in the 400 metres fence race, and this is his fifth world championship, and he thinks it's "incredible" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven for 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records in one year.
He competes in the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres in London.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London, and he's worth keeping an eye on too: he's got an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings at the UK World Championships and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "hugely proud" of having so many Scots on board, some of whom are serious about competing for finals places and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be a captain, but it’s even more special because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for prize places.
Captain's speech?
I thought it went all right.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home pageant.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, from his political principles.
The criticism must have been annoying.
But he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep to be slaughtered," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should be learning from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
Hogan was sued by the U.S. Civil Rights Association earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also understated online.
“What does it matter? It’s just Facebook,” many commenters said.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second best rating among the 50 governors.
Hogan's not very responsive to a hothead.
He has been a staunch leader of the state and firmly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and posted a picture of a bald head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users entering the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they elected, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said that their comments were respectful, considerate and relevant.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments to the Washington Post news.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organized group in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "focused attack," and someone else might call them "promoting things that are considered important."
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to control by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It’s the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Judge James C. Cacheris of the Alexandria District Court, the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights League went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
At the time of Washington, low-cost postage had a similar effect to what the internet does today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and Washington was hammered by anonymous writers.
At the time, there were trolls.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing Jay's agreement, the US-British Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as shown by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about a half a dozen places, plus online adverts from a couple of, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Scientist Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoan called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, and especially pigeons.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in finch birds.
In 2009 it went really well.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch population, after which the species’ populations have been on the path to recovery.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Museum Master of Natural History at the University of Helsinki (Luomus).
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field front at Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home field front for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Rafferty, from Northern Ireland, led a tournament in the neighbouring Archerfield Links field last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of the new venue and is the ambassador for the tournament on behalf of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players can see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador of the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great presentation for this field."
England’s Eales defends the title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," the player living in Southport says.
"I couldn't defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament isn't part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
“Last year’s memories come back to me: winning the tournament was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr is back in action on his own soil, and he went on tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Gaming at home is always more important than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and I’ve been playing pretty hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by six Scotsmen: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free entry to the tournament. Parking for a car costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade’s communications company, at least so far, the brigade was reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
Investigations began when a man who had dropped out of his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of the other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated case, and the other servants in that unit have not had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this in depth.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, says Holma.
The brigade's statement says that due to the arrival of the July batch, goods must have been moved to the barracks, which may have caused a temporary increase in dustiness.
The air may have seemed stale because of this, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use stoves in cooking.
He rarely uses pots.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled Papua province of Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato — locally "nota" — directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the burnt sweet potato is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as laundry in cloudy water retrieved from a nearby swamp.
The toilet office is provided by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of his four wives and has not been assigned fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger to the Jakarta government, which holds tight control of the area and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, the eastern part of the island being part of Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and bleak. The journey starts with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-wrinking five-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, the corrugated roofs of which have been dyed yellowish brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribesmen of Papua worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei says. She means her colorful, hand-woven wrap headdress, her dark skirt and her bright-colored blouse.
"We used to only have leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also a gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Just a hundred miles from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most lucrative gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine generated $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the repressive presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers being paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater sovereignty threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s took on the proportions of genocide.
Last year, more than 3,900 people were arrested by Indonesian police in peaceful protests in the area.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane entitled We Will Lose Everything contains accounts of the previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electrocution are particularly popular — and relentless attacks toward peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as the natural resources of Papua attract migrants from the rest of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million people in the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographic is changing as Indonesians from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in hopes of better livelihoods.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“Migrators have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a lower price than the locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo — nicknamed Jokowi — promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights violations in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 and expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced some kind of wavebase just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on motorcycles from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of the victims and the Witnesses, drunken soldiers captured and assaulted the children, beating them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, a state election committee building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans —young men and women and children —assembled on a football field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They carried hunting bows for celebrations, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, where they danced in a ring and imitated bird song.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere became hot, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been made public to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the resident leader of the Kego Koto area, suspected the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his wooden house, painted brightly.
Kayame still does not know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots fired in crowd".
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME magazine in sorrow. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killing was sent to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the case investigated immediately so that nothing like this ever happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to recant his words.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed for that," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes relate to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been solved, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai are bleakly disbelief at the claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired of this."
He said he still lives in fear, even though it’s been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panai people do not dare to discuss the event.
He reports that he had been beaten by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers sought me out after the victims were buried," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring region of Paniai in Deiyai.
One was killed and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which started when the director refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man in need of hospitalization was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught on the water while fishing on a nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at a construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes living in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans with random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
as well as bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they tend to go to locals for better-educated and affluent migrants.
Few people have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Youths do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua is under-regarded in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, despite having been granted a rare filming permit, an official reason for their inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia's deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency and promoted development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"The journalists reporting from the troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from its immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations", including the Paniai shooting scene.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
The locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the people of Papua say they are unlikely to vote for Yokowi anymore.
"Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the shooting scene in Paniai," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panais: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in want and poverty, virtually without access to health care and education.
According to Gobai, the Panais, like other Papuans, consider their votes given to Yokowi to be a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting once more demonstrated resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in a police station and an army office across the country.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora on Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 at the Hartwall Arena.
The game was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora throws the reason the rematch was completely flopped on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland was a flop, but it wasn’t my fault.
I don’t live in Finland, I don’t want to sell tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don’t want to see him fight because he sucks.
Helenius and Chisora first met at the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial point verdict.
Ticket sales for the rematch went smoothly, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanom in May that the match has been postponed until the autumn.
Since then, there has been nothing new about the match.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
The game would probably have to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on,” Chisora said.
The British say they are currently in about 45 percent health.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat to Whyte in December with scattered voices.
Fire takes over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for second time
The flames took over one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from the 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was cleared, and no one is known to have been injured. The cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue officials, firefighting forces were able to extinguish the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior surfaces of tall buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building's board of directors commissioned a study that found that the panels used for facade cladding and insulation were the most damaged.
In the UK, police believe that insulation and cladding plates at London's Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid progression of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A motorcycle was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.
The moped disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The moped was made by Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police request observations of the moped or its theft by e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Modified on 3 August 2017 at 12:40 p.m.: Police announced that the moped has been found.
In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers carry prohibited items, according to a survey.
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto airplanes past U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed objects that they did not know were banned.
Less than 1% said they only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
More than 1,000 passengers responded to the survey and were carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers knowingly violating the TSA rules, 19.7% were Gen Y representatives and less than 15% belonged to Generation X.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by bringing food and liquids onto the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking bladed objects on airplanes, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported knowingly taking banned drugs on airplanes.
The survey involved passengers from all over the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many had accidentally taken smuggling goods past the security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It’s not surprising that most travelers are also more likely to pass security checks, knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the surveying company notes, the TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids can be taken on board the aircraft and how much.
So it’s no surprise that the majority of TSA seizures are liquid.
For a while there was also a belief that books should not be taken on board the aircraft.
Fluids can be taken on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency director Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay Obama's decision to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of smog-causing emissions-reducing decisions made during the Obama administration.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency under his leadership takes better account of the needs of environmental decision-makers in the states than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
Lands should start to comply with the ground-level ozone requirements for 2015 as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year ahead so that his agency would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the state's attorney general in Oklahoma before being appointed by President Donald Trump as the head of the EPA.
Since his arrival in Washington, D.C., Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to ease regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, which required the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday night, Pruitt claimed that his turnaround on ozone regulations only strengthens EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to sue it for an agreement on schedules," Pruitt said. He sued the Environment Agency more than ten times in his previous post.
"We do not believe in legal regulation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us."
However, the EPA statement stated that Pruitt may continue to use "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, adopted last month, aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA's coalition of states that sued this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
"The EPA's change of mind as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is generated when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it took to get the guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense,” said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interest groups.”
Supercar manufacturer becomes SUV 'takes place in Ferrari style'
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while maintaining its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style," Sergio Marchionne, CEO, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of Eastern Savo measles with the same virus type
Rantasalmi measles infection is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a person in the coastal Strait has the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections detected in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles outbreak in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not identified any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still emerge after the fifth patient until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for infectious diseases in Soster’s primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspected cases have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone ensures that their own vaccination protection is up-to-date,” Erkkilä points out.
Three new measles infections confirmed in Pirkanmaa - "Additional infections or epidemic very unlikely"
Finland prepares for a legitimate scream
Moonshine soup was not even considered for legalization.
The underlying argument is that the process produces methanol in addition to liquor, which is toxic.
Making screams at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup is not even considered.
The scream is made by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, in addition to liquor.
There has been no political will to enact moonshine soup into everyman’s law,” Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered to be legalized.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There was no debate about the liberalisation of distillation, MP Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) says.
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, who took a position on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
A permit for distilling moonshine at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial production is also subject to a licence.
Tuominen says that home brewing of alcoholic beverages will become a simple rule: alcohol can be prepared at home by fermentation.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make a scream at home.
The government wants to simplify the rules.
The new law removes the requirements for flavoring and flavouring substances and enables the production of screams, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavours and flavourings produced during fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give yourself alcohol as a gift.
It is not allowed to be sold.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session will be held on 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It’s as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital with armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital due to suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains, but he was released from the hospital in the afternoon.
A prison spokesperson confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
Texts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican-Australian leaders have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States reproached Nieto for having knocked out the wall project publicly. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take refugees to Australia is "ridiculous", "sad", and "stupid". Trump said that the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the settlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the day."
Georgia Massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynching in hopes of justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man stutters.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a reenactment that aired on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is tied to "Roger"'s neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge to stage the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
"It's puzzling that no one has been arrested during these years — even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the rearrangement.
"It is a stain of shame in history, but above all it is a burden that weighs upon our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former congressman of Georgia.
For him, the re-enactment is a startling call to action, and it also reminds Monroe's residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to go to trial. We want things to be brought to an end at last, and we want to recover from the grief and make peace, but above all we want justice," Brooks said.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the massacre in Georgia on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, the Supreme Court gave blacks in the state of Georgia the right to vote for the first time in a presidential election. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, around the time of the election, an incident occurred in which a black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight that apparently concerned Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, it was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, powerful white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail, for which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and organized the murders," the FBI's report states.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voter murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
It is extremely realistic and captivating, and it is a description of a shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the present-day United States.
It’s hard to watch, but it’s even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we'd have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — about a dozen blacks and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played a local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years in the reenactment, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh said.
“It is important, however, that this aspect of history be brought up so that it never happens again.”
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with a scene in which Malcom screams and pushes Hester. He is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I said get out of my land, n--u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
Then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
“Did I accidentally hit too hard?” he asks.
“No,” Greene said.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--u at the time."
“Yes,” another black actor said.
"It's slang. You'll have to use the longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is occupied by the spirit of friends.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the performance, but for the memory of those who have been killed.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are blazing.
No one's laughing.
The re-enactment ends quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice breaks for every second word.
A few hundred feet away, about fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the population is black and half white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have become a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who played lynchers take off their robes and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a hard performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the show comforted.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altatta are busy discussing the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the feelings the performance evokes.
“It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch the horrible things that are said and done by people who look like you — precisely because they look like you,” he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynchings still happen," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He said he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“Resurrection is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it’s also an educational experience,” Brooks says.
"Its message is that this could happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Getting rid of vegetables in stores is a big deal: This is how much the removal of “extra parts” really saves
Is it permissible to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
How about taking off a large piece of pineapple hat - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers strongly divide opinions: for some, it is an expression of extreme snusiness, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go to the trash at home.
This phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable section of Ruoholahti in Helsinki, K-Citymarket, because many people tear off the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to biowaste in the store.
According to a news report published by the Financial News, shopkeepers are amazed by snooping around the vegetable counter.
But how much to remove the excess parts of vegetables before weighing really saves money?
How significant is the snooping technique really?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapples, artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take away leaves or stumps.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 when all the leaves were removed from it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing EUR 2.30 dropped to EUR 1.95 when its stock was twisted off.
Globe artichokes: EUR 2.60 came to EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Sponges: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without them, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without strain 80 cents.
The result: If the leaves and stumps start to pluck off, you can save a few dozen cents on one vegetable at best.
In terms of percentages, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20%.
This would have saved a total of $1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona after a five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday night it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of €222 million to FC Barcelona in the Spanish league.
A total of 222 million euros is the largest transfer in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer cost €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League delayed the move earlier Thursday when it rejected Neymar's first attempt at payment.
According to the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home audience in the PSG season opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (EUFA) so that it could determine the disciplinary measures that could be taken in the case.
Spanish League president Javier Tebas has accused PSG of violating UEFA’s rules of fair play.
UEFA can punish a club that loses more than €30 million over a three-year period.
UEFA says Neymar’s move will not automatically violate its financial rules.
Neymar's move to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for significant amounts of money, UEFA reported.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from a lightning strike, the flash was recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was working on a plane at the Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly a lightning bolt struck the plane from a rainy sky.
The force of lightning threw the plane to the ground of Dunn near the wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said he was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I asked if she was still alive,” Austin’s sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a cerebral hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It’s traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to a spokesperson for the airport, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revitalize business through dividend cuts
British training group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72 percent when it launched a new restructuring program in response to pressure on its business.
According to President and CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will be mainly made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third austerity program to revive business that was weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its net sales increased by one percent in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, according to officials, a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others wounded.
According to a NATO statement, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, killing 30 people on Tuesday in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by a "personally carried self-made explosive device".
The statement said that all injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, including 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area predominantly inhabited by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's deadliest militant faction since the overthrow of the Taliban by US-led forces in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump is considering whether the US will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA backs decision to postpone smog enforcement
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of smog-causing emissions-reducing decisions made during the Obama administration a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone definitions" late on Wednesday, the agency said the decision is evidence of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," Scott Pruitt, director of the agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone definitions by one year until October 2018 and to measure smog pollution in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency was sued by 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, who said it was illegal to delay enforcement.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to ease the environmental regulations of Barack Obama's time, saying the measures are part of a broader program for economic growth.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health consequences of rising emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhalation of ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the ISIS leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was to be taken on board the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
Police did not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans Australia has ever made.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also ongoing.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels performed well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but the forecasts were hit in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to a record level, and the EBIT development in the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the United States Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who are supposed to be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of the under 66.7-pound series, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel's premises in Los Angeles, until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won on the Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five on the comparative list of boxers in different weight categories.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and asked, "How are you, Master?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the duo posed for photographers, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between the men would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm an ex-featherweight," Garcia reminded.
"I moved up the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small enough to be 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight.
He's got to go up to the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let’s fulfill their wishes.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight".
Klimas asked whether the match should take place on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will debut in the lightweight later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight at the Forum on September 23.
"The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we come to an agreement..."
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that she might be going to watch Saturday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's huge praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike...but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the fight between them was being carried out more and more strongly.
“This is the match we’re waiting for.
No other game attracts as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great fight."
Average salary 5,300 euros, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom a banker’s investment advisor spoke complete nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules for investment advisors and different types of sales of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The tightening is based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not define skills requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services complete their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of qualifications for an APV investment qualification company, whose degree group includes experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIVA), universities and operators in the field.
The degrees are 12-15 ECTS credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which offers management development services.
Its website reports that in general both exams are "very extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Managing Director of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the pass rate of the exams is roughly approximately 70.
Most of the employees of the largest banks have completed either APV1 or APV2, as they are mandatory under the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banker companies without mentioning names, whose staff seems to have avoided taking the examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" such banker shops.
According to Saviko, since 2000, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000-14,000 people and around 3,000 more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors.
Some banker firms consider completing the degree to be an advantage.
Many other sectors have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires that APV degrees be completed, because it is then that expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros per month on average, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of regular working hours for monthly wage earners is approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men working in positions earn more than 5,900 euros per month and women over 4,500 euros per month.
The tithe of those with the highest income earns, on average, about EUR 8,100.
A tenth of the men with the highest earnings earn more than €9,000 or more per month, while one tenth of the women with the highest earnings earn €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
So far, self-regulation has been relied upon at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva involved individual cases where the expertise and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the activities of the advisor.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a weak level.
In this regard, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year this will be tightened with the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements concerning the competence and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply both to the investment firms’ own staff and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to the Government proposal given by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva is expected to have the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing training.
All of this must be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this has also been done.
The Court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map out the roles of the personnel on an individual level.
There will certainly be different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if the skills or experience are not at an adequate level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, the changes will make the rules stricter and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane 'drawing' giant plane over U.S.
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States by Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out on Thursday 787 Dreamliner aircraft, on which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, the Seattle-based aircraft flew a distance of 15,700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within U.S. borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra’s persistent beach swimming school students don’t have a moment of rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen persevered with the help of a swimming pool village
Iines Allikkonen proceeded at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Sludge and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers aren’t that bad, says Taina Itkonen, who runs swimming schools.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children will be able to swim, and next week there will be about a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that then school and eskari will start, estimates Itkonen.
Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation with the Sports Uniting project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, the swimming pool had a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school children were training to stay on the surface with the swimming sticks, even without someone.
The younger siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines Kaikko, 5, was first questioned about going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to push towards the beach.
You're doing great!
He said he went swimming a lot this summer.
He thinks the slurry beach is good.
Like everyone else, Vili Huhtanen practiced swimming persistently with the swimming sticks, 5.
You will also be pleased with today’s achievements, Uimaope praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, wanted to go to water wars again.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, from the beach, sees the beach swimming school as a good start for learning to swim.
Even though the weather has been bad, Anna has loved to come here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming schoolers packed up on the pier.
The boys were busy with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacking on fruit and frying the day.
In the water, the lessons continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
One that doesn’t belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes - "Here's a kind of unifying story"
You can see all kinds of things.
A couple of days ago, the manufacturer of cleaning products, Sinituote, launched the Unknown Soldier product range.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and laundry racks and "toilet brush on the edge brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film that premieres this autumn and the marketing of the film.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film,” Määttä says.
According to him, there will be a special presentation of the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a unifying story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products,” Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his core Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
Cleaning is not foreign to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall’s vichys have been introduced to the market, for example, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
The unknown products were already available by Kalle Kinnunen, blogger of Suomen Kuvalehti.
Coffee and clocks are also available.
He said there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time to go on.
Of the unknown’s partners, war products have not yet been revealed, for example, by Valio, Refiner, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl,” Kinnunen writes.
New results of Swedish asylum-seekers’ age tests published
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over the age of 18. However, not everyone finds the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Forensics Agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far commissioned 6,880 tests, and the forensics office has now published the results of 2,481 tests, which were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Of those tested, 80%, or 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over 18 years of age, and in 25 cases, the Forensics Agency determined that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Bureau of Forensic Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no major differences in previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over 18 years old, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that there were "indicatives that the subject is 18 years of age or older" in 442 cases.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes x-rays of the wisdom teeth and MRIs of the knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told Metro newspaper.
However, the forensic agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, one can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test is about 18 years old, and the risk is about 10 per cent."
Ilonen collapses 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 sections on a result strip down in the European golf tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left for 11th place on Saturday, but found 41th place at the end of the round.
In the difficult weather, Ilonen was accompanied by three bogs with one double bog.
Others had trouble, too.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot on the one under par lap, despite saying that the umbrella held had enough work to do.
The weather was rough, but I hung with it and in the end it was a good day, Poulter thought.
He shares the top spot with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia to change party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he would change parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The crowd burst into applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of the registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised to make a significant announcement at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining business from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's change of party is yet another blow to the Democratic Party that builds barriers rather than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party without any kind of leadership and unable to find a positive, people-uniting message," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Lightnings sown damage - Thursday becoming even the hardest day of summer
At the end of the week, more thunderstorms will also occur in southern Finland.
During the past week, thunderstorms have occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, lightning strikes started several fires.
Meteorologists say Thursday may be the worst day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
During the past week, lightning has occurred especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical center of the row house, causing a small fire.
Rescue services received a report of the fire about 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The power center was located in the sauna room at the end of the row house.
Rescue services demolished the roof and wall to find the fire hotspots and quickly put out the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injury was avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning set the outbuilding in flames in Harjulandie before midnight.
When the rescue department arrived, the building was already in full phase of fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the spread of the fire.
The 50-square-foot outbuilding burned to the ground.
On the other side of the road, lightning struck the house.
Residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
Rescue services visited the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning could not cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
The information about the fault was received between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not resolved until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has also continued normally on the thunder-stricken section of the line.
Lightnings have been wreaking havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, the statistics have been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been absolutely miserable! estimates Jari Tuovinen, meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, many feel even strong.
This might seem like a really loud thunderstorm, but that’s what it’s been like compared to this summer’s thunderstorms,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, ground lightning blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had potential for even the toughest thunderstorm of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues in the early evening, we can get over the two thousand lightning, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-low thunderstorm year was in 2015, when the year’s lightning count was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning had risen to 18,386 lightning.
So there is still something to be done so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid at the end of the week, which is a birthplace suitable for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms will be on Saturday from the northernmost parts of the country to the south, where you can get around 2,000 lightning days on both Saturday and Sunday.
In the middle of the country, a more unified rain front is promised.
In such cases, according to Tuovinen, thunders only infrequently.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology over doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia issued on Thursday due to the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian Athletic Director Dmitry Shljahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia’s ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were deprived of a gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletic competitions in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) presented evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation," Coe, chairman of the IAAF, told reporters.
"The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its activities."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the terms for ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete in neutral athlete status at the World Championships in Athletics starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still insufficient, and the banned coaches are still operating freely," he told reporters Friday to the IAAF Council after a presentation in London.
Production company disappointed by poor success of Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not turn out to be as successful as the creators hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by Helsinki Film’s CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is little compared to the film's budget, about five million euros.
It didn’t turn out to be a lottery win, but it’s important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful in Finland, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distributions,” Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football economic rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive transfer of players ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play economic rules, which require PSG to be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's transfer to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its Star Guard, as it follows to fund the Qatari oil-rich dynasty.
Clubs are allowed to spend large amounts of money on acquiring players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The fair play economic rules were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platin, the French president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from clubs' debts to tracking their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period for fair play economy rules will run until 2018, during which time clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of €30 million.
Although Platini had to leave UEFA chairmanship in a scandalous way in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
“The Fair Play rules are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for Fair Play Economics at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a lump sum, it can amortise the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of €44.4 million for the next five years.
Under fair play economic rules, the first sanctions were issued in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, funded by Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA does not count the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support for PSG was overstated.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's merits in the PSG might be financed by fees available from Qatar's 2022 World Cup Organising Commission.
However, the PSG and the Organising Commission have denied that Neymar would be made an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to the PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is following more closely than usual attempts to circumvent the rules.
Sources informed of the situation said Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's move.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identities are not disclosed because they have no authority to discuss the PSG's situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit to over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% as a result of the Neymar deal.
The Spanish League, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make it difficult for Neymar to move, allegedly violating fair play economic rules.
"This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state," Spanish League president Javier Tebas told the Spanish AS newspaper.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the government funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the playing environment of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns a football team.
Compliance with fair play economic rules becomes extremely difficult. There are so many different interests involved in the fact that the famous player represents the state."
The coach of the Finnish World Athletes is stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-jumper Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, although she should be coaching at the World Championships in Athletics in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualification tomorrow and Mäkelä in the triple jump qualification on Saturday.
However, the two's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in the British broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but it has also not qualified for a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Jorma Kemppainen, head of coaching, said.
He has always successfully handled visa matters himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do anything to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for many years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the signs in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach’s possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London calls for a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will start in London on Friday and last for a week or so, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of athletes, success is measured by medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one competition to another, where experience is used to mature the athlete’s performance to the level that an adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small Finnish World Cup team, but there are no veterans either.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interestingness and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws the bench athletes to the television screen and glues to watch the games, although the London medals are not decided until late at night due to the time difference.
From the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by spear thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
The darers are waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki even now, even though the latest results from him and the other throwers, as well as Pitkämäki’s remaining in the qualification last summer’s championships, tell the other story.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For the other Finnish athletes of the games, entering the final competition or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finnish athletics in the coming years will be a good success in the international youth championships this summer.
The refining of young talent and the financial support for its work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah races, and not because of terrorist deterrence or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best in the big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
In his final jump, he attempted the cabalerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and feels good now, but I’m sorry that the last jump didn’t go well.
I’m going to try it again from now on, Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, a competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new express ship remains in port in Helsinki
Viking’s new express ship, FSTR, is behind schedule.
The express ship was to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was an eight-hour loading on the ship.
The ship arrived late in Helsinki.
I've been waiting at least an hour and a half to get on the boat.
Now the car queue is moving a little, Johannes Rebane, an Estonian waiting to board the ship in the Port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical failure on the new ship.
Rebane reported that the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting for access to the ship in their cars.
Viking communications manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours from the return trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Kuutostie on Thursday night

Police are directing traffic on Route Six, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
At the mulch point, the transport proceeds along road 13 to Mustola harbour.
Small Circuit Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously yearns for both the characters' 80s glory days and the '90s grunge (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time — before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, and the series' other stars moved on to bigger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a depiction of the constant reminiscence we have been stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it seems to be obsolete.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it was, among other things, the background story of a vegetable can that spoke with H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teens approaching adulthood. Emphasizing it makes the impossible to reach the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotionally-based, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys, for example, '90s stalker movies, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up an Apple Powerbook, inline skates, and "other stuff from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) with his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always, in such a series, the best are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see the younger Paul Rudd, who has a beard dot under his lower lip, Matt Dillon’s soul patch from Singles. Rudd’s Andy, the king of the camp, is starting to be an old man.
Moments of random madness may lift this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer — Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends goes to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde movie, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy series is directed by Rhys Thomas and is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharestian cop couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the series' lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there is not much else.
The show has some good visual jokes (policemen spend time watching chess on television the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, gets too caught up in imitating a clumsy socialist drama, including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask. That’s why the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long, and the show's humor is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the show might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby eating burgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we were numbed by our own recent history and their history as well.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru to enter the ring in Macau on Saturday against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru is facing a tough bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting at the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also wears the black belt of jujutsu and the World Championship of the sport.
For once in my life, I'm going to fight a parent.
It’s funny, the 32-year-old said.
Kouvola was supposed to enter the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were obtained on a quick schedule in the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
I've never seen a Taurus like that before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It was annoying because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has been given for the struggle.
Waiting for a week doesn’t have much to do with preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, as it will not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
In his previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths lie in standing up.
This time it's different.
Issaa Kouvolalainen describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes in the first round hard and tries to get into the rug.
He has won the World Jujutsu Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match did not go as planned.
Kevin Belingon, a Filipino, hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when I was standing: he didn't get a single hit.
When I went to pour, he hit my eye.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the MFAs fight once a year, some rise more frequently into the ring.
For example, Issa, a future opponent, last fought in September.
Last year, Tauru had three matches.
This is the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace gets pregnant.
Over the past few years, I have been training and being in good shape all the time.
I have only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, she decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy back.
We got really good training with a friend from Sweden.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday the Kouvola employee will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice standing.
Standing up is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You've got to hit him rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take it myself.
Down-exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who has previously fought in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think we have a big and great evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged, as economic growth has been unyielding and the easing of inflation has put an end to speculation about interest rate increases.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, shifting interest rates due to increasing pressure on families' income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of six to ten to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that household income levels will be under further pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest rate increases will be needed in the coming years to contain the inflation boosted by Brexit, and the bank announced that the cost of loans could have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, members of the commission decided to cancel part of the massive economic package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide preferential financing to banks in excess of £15 million, or a total of £115 million, through the programme.
The minutes of the Bank’s interest rate decision state: “According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Commission, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, as the decline in households’ real income reduces consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that a "some tightening of monetary policy" of the market expectations "slightly wider" is needed to contain inflation.
The market currently forecasts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecasted a growth rate of 1.9 per cent for this year and a growth rate of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
The pound depreciated against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound depreciated by 0.5 per cent to 1.31 per cent and weakened by 0.4 per cent to 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth figures dampened increased expectations of interest rate increases, with GDP growing by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and low wage increases, and the bank says the situation will deteriorate even further before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "can't stop" the decline in revenue in the coming years, however, it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound sterling, which will offset part of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after a shock result in the EU referendum that plunged the pound sterling into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the central bank’s latest decision, interest rate increases had been called for more and more loudly, as inflation put pressure on households, and three decision-makers in July called for a 0.5% interest rate increase.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will pick up again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess of its 2% target was due to a "totally" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be getting even tighter as lenders are feverishly seeking customers and looking to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market looks particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal agreements are increasingly popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS imposes 10,000 anti-HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed a "revolutionary" HIV inhibitor. The Supreme Court closed a dispute over the funding of the drug in the English Public Health System (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PreEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-conferencing medication has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's ruling by the Supreme Court, which states that the NHS will be able to pay for the PrEP drug, although claiming that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as "a crucially important moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept registrations for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The experiment will reach its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is an anti-HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection before sexual intercourse.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A medicine taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
It can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who are not receiving effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates from men, women and transgender and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general medical care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the NHS of England signed a procurement agreement this week for the medicines following an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, uptake and implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV,” says Stevens.
“It’s yet another remarkable achievement in over 30 years of struggle to solve one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, head of the National AIDS Agency.
“If PrEP is targeted correctly for those who need it and those at risk, it could have a life-changing impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those in the high-risk group will receive, through an experiment funded by the NHS, a drug that they can decide on their own use without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news.”
"The most important thing now is to make sure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded from it," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that was unnecessarily prolonged by several months due to the government's slowdown," said Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister.
"We have evidence that the drug can have a life-changing effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker interested in real estate renovation, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anna-style house. The success of the renovation is confirmed by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her equipment and moved.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment display and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer the same day."
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete deformation.
It was a two-room apartment with only access to the bedroom from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to take advantage of the height of the room.
“I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design firm in Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to take advantage of the space of rooms nearly four meters high and create an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The height of the room was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor in which to stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to crouch.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the middle floor, Retrouvius’ copper lattice window opens into an elegant living area.
Mirrored-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Add to the style that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what’s unique about Joanne’s kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a little planning,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced veneer-surfaced MDF door.
"It is balanced, meaning it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With the rational use of space and the design of the storage space, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better floor plan.
“When selling a property, the area determines — or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In a basic case, a real estate agent walks into an apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area".
Joanne's apartment area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The tenant is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is created partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one is attached to electrical wires running in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.”
Joanne’s apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It can also mean that you don’t want to move out of the house anymore.
Pregnant Princess Sofia shines in her summer look
Princess Sofia’s choice of costumes hit the spot.
Princess Sofia represented Båstad in Sweden for the last time before she was born.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia smiled at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden visited Båstad this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented at the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue body-fitting outfit that dressed a pregnant princess at her last.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His due date is September.
For dinner, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and an elegant little bag.
The pastel blue was a great dress for the princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her costume with a small bag.
Sofia was actually radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even talked to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," said Sofia, laughing and referring to her late pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti market where Thai food was sold.
They did not dare to taste, but walked by.
The food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Bayers to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the taste, he said.
I got hooked on a lacquer.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, and I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you are hungry and there are limited places, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
Little by little we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat at the plate with a dictionary learning Thai.
Two years went by in the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because the seasoning pastes they made themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new seat was opened at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we silhouettes are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows her client.
He is told where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what kind of food everyone eats.
He has seen how the customer’s life stages change and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went with to eat my first spring roll.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and he remembers what I was like when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit down next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans over the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our senses of taste but also our thoughts and hearts.
Nowadays, many speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always been kind.
He's a hard worker.
He goes to the restaurant with a sponge and a blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated the completion of two decades.
Our customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without any attention or attention, I had a great day at work.
Discovery of underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
At the beginning of the year, security officials received an important list of counter-terrorism activities.
The list contains information on more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also pictures of each one.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have become more precise.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi military special forces found a list of the terrorists' identities and photos while searching the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the people, but also their date of birth, invented aliases and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also specifies the areas of expertise of terrorists.
For example, Sami J., a 27-year-old German on the list, bears the name Abu Assid al-Almani, meaning German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya, and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
Next to his picture is written a speciality suicide bomber.
The fate of the man is not known.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe to join ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
Man fell below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue services, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
On Thursday, a person under water was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire officer on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue service diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
Rescue services received a report after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to emergency care.
Estlander said it was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interview, he wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task run by the Border Guard.
They also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and police.

The brothers are fighting for more than $500 million in real estate
The two brothers argue over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million, a dispute related to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Former Carlton football club president and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives in the Toorak estate just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the Supreme Court over a dispute over the division of property and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The retail chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to a contract with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal to himself," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard by the Supreme Court for the first time on Friday after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers also now argue over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of the business.
Colin says the claim is untrue, accusing Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution to the matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is my priority," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family purchased a property in Collingwood where Colin set up the family's first denim store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial conditions of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, despite being a former board member of the Australian Football League club and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who answered, and he told me in his text that he can't comment on it because it's going to be heard in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued, saying that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, the hope seemed to be gone.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president’s media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff is going to restrict President Trump's media use and news monitoring so that the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior executives on his first day on the job, he raised a key problem he intends to address: he plans to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information — whether printed or heard at the briefings — must pass through him because the president makes better decisions when good information is received."
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s use of media and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades — and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If Presidential candidate Trump got upset about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media handled things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser for the Trump campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico journalist Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign workers, it is essential to control Trump's use of Twitter that his personal flow of media includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it’s ridiculous to claim that Trump’s use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don’t know — maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing problems even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are rival factions in the White House who are trying to promote their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide questionable information to the president.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on one incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say he may be enraged by newspaper clippings that criticize him - especially if they report harmful leaks - and then he has to know where the information comes from.
That’s what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of a news story on GotNews.com, a website founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Deputy Staff Chief Katie Walsh of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later retracted them, and he did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had started reading the story after asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Personnel Secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a system of document management for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Maybe he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pushing their own business.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year contract with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year contract with French football club PSG.
Earlier on Thursday night it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of €222 million to FC Barcelona in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to move to Parisian club PSG.
A total of 222 million euros is the largest transfer in football history.
The record was previously held by Manchester United, which last summer cost €105 million for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Bestselling author Raija Oranen: "I'm OK with my life"
Raija Oranen, the best-selling author of the series The Time of the Rose and the Clean White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
The five grandchildren keep their grandmother so close to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola’s apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring a rental apartment also left.
In the light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raija was once driven by the depression and alcoholism from which she has survived.
The external appearance is also 20 kilograms lighter.
Weight began to drop when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were anti-depressants.
I was helped with alcoholism at the time by hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I overcame it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the brilliant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been traveling together for over 45 years.
I've never felt better.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been traveling together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen he's always been, ending his life like that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had an extensive career as a writer, only remembers well the 44-part Clean White Sheets TV series, which touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to start the clothing industry as a fresh family company when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I acted as a model, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many scripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
Travellers return across ditch to 'millionaires alley'
One of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands is once again on a hair note with stubborn travelers who managed to cross the ditch longed for by the municipality and return to the field adjacent to the houses.
They parked their caravans near a street called the Millionaires' Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat, which the municipality needed as a procession, with children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused Solihull Municipality of "complete inability to solve the problem".
An anonymous resident reports that the travelers came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passersby.
"We have to be tough on the municipality because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The travelers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more today."
The resident reported that Birmingham Municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it".
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the travelers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they've even let a horse graze in a park."
A spokesperson for Solihull Municipality said the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report disturbing or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to form an overall picture of the situation for a court hearing."
Infuriated people surrounded the Portuguese plane
The men who crashed on a beach in Portugal have been tried in court today.
As a result of the crash, two people died yesterday.
Two men flying the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, the longest sentence is 16 years.
A small plane flew by men was forced to land on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit the man with his back on the plane.
Immediately after that, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, to the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl’s parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and started beating on it, according to Celia Rocha in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle that no more people died.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash.
A Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won another World Cup gold medal: "Without an accident, I wouldn't be a world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time World Cup gold in a banked slalom competition held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also previously won the World Cross gold medal.
In all, there have already been three World Cup titles.
What an incredible World Cup!
Two times the gold was treated, quite good heart rate is drawn, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
The whole of Paralumbia has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new skiers involved.
I always wonder if there is a black horse.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age he had been downhill with his friends, and the accident did not make him want to get to the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without the accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no point in ifs.
The cards that are dealt are played with, Suur-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to label a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a stroke of luck, and Suur-Hamari does not.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that it turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar’s biggest interest in surfing was already waning.
It was only after the accident that the job started to get to the top.
I used to work out with guys when I was a kid, and we were always excited to hit the X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself in that X-Games starter.
I couldn't have imagined it before.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sorry.
I decided to put on my overalls and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with the choice of wheelchair runner Leo-Pekka Tähti as athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner was awarded at the sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the Parasports people.
It was a big deal and the win was definitely worth it.
This will certainly also open your eyes to the world of parasports.
When is it time to launch Matti Suur-Hamar’s Athlete of the Year campaign?
We'll see in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Suur-Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he desired.
Next year we have a big goal.
A year from now, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
We are going to get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not expect to return to their homeland permanently.
“The end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen if they are to return home.
The Trump administration is not expected to change the conflict in Syria.
The media agency chain Burson-Marsteller investigated the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24 years answered the survey, half of them women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young Syrian refugees do not expect to return to their home country permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may think of returning to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the most important factors affecting young people’s decision to return home are the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for permanent return, while a quarter see ISIS leaving the country as the most important factor.
Only less than one-tenth of the key factors influencing the decision are the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to war is more important than the abdication of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter say Assad’s presidency is an obstacle to a peace agreement.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
A mere quarter of the population believes in resolving the conflict through military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth sees ISIS’s power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feels that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media should inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people gave priority to military measures and education reform.
More than a tenth believe that the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration’s impact on the conflict in Syria, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the conflict in Syria will worsen under Trump.
Opinions are divided on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the internet organized - the database he develops is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs users nothing at all, and can be developed online by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of a Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge amounts of data are kept in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use LinkedIn, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use MariaDB’s or MySQL’s database.
“All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there,” explains Widenius.
Widenius, MariaDB’s CTO, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world’s most popular open source database, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a sure promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already started a company that started developing MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of Sun’s top 20 developers to ensure that the continuity of the code was secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop it into a branch of its own.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of code development by MariaDB.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s multi-billion dollar trading, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year,” said Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO at MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce in the company’s key figures.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in an instant, because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia, DBS, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba’s Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in Linux operating system distribution packages, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
“Our customers include some of the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks,” Paqvalé said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, too, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although research firm Gartner says that the biggest database companies have lost market share in recent years, players like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast growing, in terms of revenue.
In the $50 billion database market, open source databases don’t even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users pay nothing for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will be developing more than 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open ones at the time, or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies don’t get new customers, because most of them choose open source.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases having jumped into the clouds.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers,” says Widenius.
Due to the hassle of changing a closed database, the majority of customer companies have obediently swallowed up price increases.
“There are a lot of customers that are really difficult to switch to because their old applications and others are closed in the database,” says Widenius.
However, he believes that the number of customers is coming to an end.
As license fees go up each year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous price, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they want.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change their database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received €25 million in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has approximately 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros per year for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” Paqvalén says.
Widenius is saddened by how Finland spends money on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it cannot invent or can do on its own.
The 55-year-old Widenius, along with another Finnish Linux developer, Linus Torvalds, is one of the most well-known contributors to open source.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this subject.
Italy strengthens its approach to civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs who rescue refugees on board their ships in the Mediterranean that they may not continue their activities unless they undertake to comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of collaborating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which operated for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The Jugend Rettet vessel had been monitored by Italian authorities since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who were able to re-use the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, according to a prosecutor's document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and the motive is considered to be the zeal for assistance.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operations.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue efforts have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
On Thursday, he said that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable because they did not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue efforts.
Among those who refused to comply with the Code is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, stated that the rescue efforts have resulted in a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, which he considers to be an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In recent days, a light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue discussions this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Season worker suspected of killing cohabiting partner in Enontekiö, suspect found in terrain - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enontekiö in Kuttanen last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police also said the suspect had fled with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when captured.
The charges must be filed within less than a week.
The case may still be dealt with in the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and Friends of All Hairs, has passed away.
Actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theater.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role as Secretary of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in the James Herriot book My Friends of All Hair television series.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and phone calls she used to incite the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in a Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the verdict and had to wait for the application to be examined in liberty.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a weeping look cast on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not claimed responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level, and even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his act".
The prosecution read Conrad's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, in which the mother said that "not a day goes by that I do not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I will cope with all this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she is "haunted" by the idea that she will never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose the person who's been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never goes away," Camdyn said.
The case seems to become a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car from carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had been inciting his boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the generator, and you're free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter, one of the defenders being Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion paper by Knox stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
NATO says relations with Russia worst since Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump called for thanks to Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, for the poor relations between the two countries.
Audi changes 850,000 diesel engines due to car manufacturers’ setback
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to upgrade the software for more than 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said the company believes "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies mentioned a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralising devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of supporting large car companies and ignoring problems.
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices on cars that reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but their actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics director of Audi’s engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system on its cars to circumvent European emissions requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote begins fraud investigation, large protests are expected
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election result," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro assures that the crisis will end
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a council of representatives was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against changing it.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to the newspaper El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The troops are meant to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked decrease in rainfall in spring, and especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence.
"This shortens the life span of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cicadas into the area that spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long ears and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer parts containing essential oil."
The solution is sought by increasing the efficiency of irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water.
Journalist's murder shows growing threat in Mexico
The editor of the once-a-week newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine addresses the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security in the light of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been asked to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists are discussing which is safer: to leave the children at home or to involve them in a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking reporters to name names for each group, no evidence needed, no findings and no feelings.
The names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being hired by the government or drug cartels are written on the board, and they are criminals who make the chaos in Mexico a life-threatening newscast.
The violence is unceasing, and the attacks are increasingly targeted by journalists. According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and source of inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, although he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge image with Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts decorated with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a panama hat that has become a trademark.
The meeting takes place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
A federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010, specifically for dealing with journalists' cases, but only two charges have been filed so far, according to the Journalist Protection Committee.
Journalist murderers are rarely prosecuted, as are the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, few of which end up in court.
Riodoce's journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had only driven a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the magazine's name: Riodoce means twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to mourn by his wife and two grown children.
Rumors move quickly and freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez’s death is still silent.
Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
Someone or several people are shot dead daily in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery has decorative two-story burial buildings of drug barons, larger than many homes.
In a state on the coast, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, the founder and director of Riodoce, 60, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, head of a rival faction waging war against the Guzman boys.
Guzman's boys may have been upset by the case: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine entered the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper that published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career at Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to start Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by articles in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade unceasingly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the Journalist Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist has to take on a task that falls upon him — or act stupid.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here — why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez - a joker who cursed like a dock worker, a friend who always gave them a hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were his fate.
The death of a colleague has also caused them to wonder how best they can do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we talk about their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug-trafficking runways.
They were left out of the cases," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that something is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce journalist Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can be deceiving, and that's what happened in Javier's case".
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Cell phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had taken refuge in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some reporters were half joking about whether these two police officers were among the 50 percent that the state governor did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial planned three main cases.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, a group of people had been kidnapped.
There was no official record of who had been kidnapped and how, so it was necessary to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the names of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in highly publicised cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the abduction from Valdez's column.
"In the past, we would have known by now what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco", Pancake due to his slender physique.
"Now all communications with our informants have been cut off."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a warehouse that stores signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The newspaper’s employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for press freedom.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left for a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office the following morning for another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which according to DNA tests carried out by authorities is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from the government cases because he is concerned that his anger is unable to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organized crime, crime permitting authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were caused by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
In front of his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my writings."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border state after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredo's El Mana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on his front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or across the country.
It's a difficult decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and you must be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals seek out a journalist, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he escaped Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once supposed to be a poet, admits that writing about drug trafficking is scary.
“I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s reporters were sitting in front of the newspaper at midnight on the sidewalk with beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to vibrate to signal the message.
A shooting between rival gangs and security forces in the Mazatlan beach resort had killed 19 people.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Journalists posted the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
Sirens howled nearby —another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce's editorial continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait in which a man shows a middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down. "How could I shut down a magazine when our intern asked to be on the street to do a case the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
Hannu Manninen’s party, which turned 39 in April, was short, as a professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen contracted the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
In May, I was almost completely ill.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a pediatric disease like an ear infection where I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was able to do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I was sick for so long.
It was a tough time when I couldn’t take advantage of the enthusiasm for training,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomi.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the rollermat test conducted on 12 June by the Competition and Top Sports Research Centre KIHU.
In the test, the athlete skis on roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a sample of lactic acid from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
I spent 32 minutes on the carpet last autumn, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It was a wall, Manner said.
In a better direction
After the initial stages, Manninen says that he remained healthy.
I have done a variety of calm aerobic exercises to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period.
It was also a week and a half off from flying.
My family and I also had time to go to the cottage.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race, when Manninen came 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different pace of training compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have three World Cup weekends.
In December, we will be attending at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would be to be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team’s list,” Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Mannise’s sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela employee who celebrated gold in the 2002 Salt Lake City team competition underscored.
Dinosaur protects itself from its enemies by masking itself
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first findings of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner who was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology magazine, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its species in the world.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 and 12 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to study his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was excavated from a 1,100-pound boulder.
The results of the hard work can now be seen.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Skin studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it wore armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter coloration on top, which is still present in many animals.
Experts say it was better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it Borealoe after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to excavate the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a common coloring, where the body is darker on the top and lighter on the bottom.
The sighting was still a surprise, as the Borealope is significantly larger than the current animals with similar coloring.
From this, it can be concluded that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of the modern animals, deer, zebras and armadillos, for example, have a similar coloration. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that the nodosaurus was seriously threatened as well.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including the contents of its bowels to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that it fell into a river when it died and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and the rivers and seas likely extended much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and has also been three-dimensionally preserved in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period
It doesn’t take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The Cretaceous was an era of theropods, huge bipedals, carnivorous dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors included the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from researchers at Nodosaurus have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealo was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millennium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from muzzle to hip.
Nodosaurus were on average five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
From their platforms rose a two-foot-tall spike.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through present-day Western Canada until it was transported to the open sea by a flooded river.
Its armor has survived down to small details in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the pitted plates of armor along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The pitted plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales of its foot base."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York City from his home in St. Louis the day before and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a note from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street".
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information on his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police barrages and screaming people, as well as of a man claiming to be Brown's father who carried a sign saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of police standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another cop arming his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers stating.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 p.m. Ferrell picked up his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What Happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the Next Nearly Three Years has been made into a documentary film "Whose Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of local people who went out on the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell was driving towards Ferguson with their daughter in a flower dress and a crown that matches it, they had another conversation about "what it's like to be black and under what conditions". They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
"I couldn't help taking my daughter with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events in the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow into it.
He must have the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he must know what we need to do to free ourselves, to liberate ourselves.
Fortunately, while I have been able to protect her from flagrant racism, she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I were to protect him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case to be heard and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nurse Students. At the time, she focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience of organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director, at an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
Behind the suspicion were the countless times that people had appeared in the local community, usually whites, who wanted only to benefit from its hardships and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism among prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals. The film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do," Davis says.
"For me, the most important thing was how the local people are portrayed in the film, because I'm portrayed in the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because it was wanted to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but about a community".
That's why the documentary sees surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs when he tells me what it was like to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the humane portrayal of blacks require a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story reprises and re-establishes the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot a black teenage boy, Trayvon Martin, in 2012.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees, "The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women."
However, he emphasizes that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary "self-purposed" due to his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, however, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
News crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but relations between the community and the police are still strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway in a protest.
His description of the social political climate in his home corners is brief and concise: "Message."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
Suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has a face hanging in the middle of the exhibition space —white, black and brown faces that can be seen in a closer look.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third final day of his tenure.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and based on his genetic data created 30 portraits. They are a sharp, albeit somewhat theoretical, statement on the malleability, ambiguity, cause-effect relationships and identity of DNA data behind the interpretations.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 crimes, including espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a granular, black and white selfie, in which the uncomfortable Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig that became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a project called Stranger Visions, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He obtained DNA data from, for example, cigarette butts and chewing gum and created images of what the people in question could have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their case," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference.
Manning could not be visited and could not be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became pen pals, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
It’s also impressive that the show is opening right now as Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leakers and transgender soldiers and is inventing new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divides he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose".
On the wall of the gallery is a statement by the artist and underneath it is Manning's great signature, in which the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to "the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of C, G, and A letters written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotides, as the artist uses a scientific definition — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetics and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The exhibition's final work is in its own room: a page from Manning's and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
“If they can silence you, they’ve won,” the picture reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive, I still get the chills."
Unlike what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written in pencil at a height equal to his length (157.5 cm).
“The face used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd feel to it,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to film the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release".
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee who are suspected of stabbing a man to death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
Cook County court documents show that on Monday warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released on bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local news release released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incisions on her body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder. Police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, stated in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by a university and Somerville College spokesperson via email states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, Chief of Information at the Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly refining our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as horrifying.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered on the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were having an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team released the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and ‘kill Muslims’ in London
"I'm not an anti-Muslim, I'm a Catholic," the judge told police.
Moffatt must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of serious harassment.
According to police, the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threated to blow up a bookstore and kill the Muslims".
The suspect left the store after being threatened.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for threats.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Officials found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesperson said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” Moffatt told police.
As punishment, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid community service and pay £620, or about €690, legal expenses and £85, or about €95, compensation to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesperson said several hate crimes were left unreported.
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the steps set out in the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures on the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA has been given the right to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Commission (UKAD).
The WADA road map has been updated in these respects," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which specifies the conditions for restoring the powers of RUSADA. The second part of the road map was recently published on the organisation's website.
It does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be carried out.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the roadmap requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of an investigation by WADA-sanctioned Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the alleged state involvement in doping in Russian sports.
To that, Mutko stated, "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can't admit what didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement made by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian RSport sports media earlier that day, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We will not accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it received permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
Olivier Niggli, head of WADA, visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he stated that the organisation was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: 'there is no evidence' of health benefits of maternity packaging
The British organisation has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and the Guardian have announced that Lullaby Trust will ban the use of its own brochures on maternity packages distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
Concealed death is an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is a UK health authority expert on safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packed on them because it would suggest that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good figure is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, it cannot be said for sure," Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
Maternity packaging is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers for free in Finland for 80 years.
The package includes various accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best choice for a sleeping place if there is no crib or cot available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for naps and stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the packaging and making sure that they do not get wet or dirty.
Quick villain escapes from Japanese zoo for second time
A Japanese zoo staff is searching for an escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff at its speed and has already escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo.
The 35-year-old villain, who has escaped, is female, 55-pounder, and about three feet tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the farm area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of a turtle.
The villain's last escape happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
“I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help,” Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
“The questions were simply not consistent or objective,” Errett says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have entered the market, helping other companies find out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software to measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, as well as provide anonymous reporting services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with top management past the board.
“You can track your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides analytics software for companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years. He says he has gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
With the program, you can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, you can create a map that shows at a glance which departments employees are most dissatisfied with and which of the leaders have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill into the root of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow a workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. There’s been a stir around the transport company since a former employee posted on his blog about a culture of harassing employees and punishing people who talk about problems.
For startups like Glint, such defaults are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry with a value of over $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously via SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of inappropriate conduct, complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
"Public opinion has replaced the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily get in touch with the headquarters.
In the past, it was the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address with which he was able to file a report at the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, General Counsel of Ruby Tuesday, who said it was difficult to follow up on complaints from employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can now be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I’m getting a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement even more seriously after Arthur Andersen, an audit firm, collapsed as a result of unethical conduct in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public clearing of their dirty laundry.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convercent are supported by venture capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investment is no surprise, given the links between business, corporate culture and venture capital.
Several studies have shown that employees expect more from their jobs.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a truly beneficial company.
“Employees are more committed to the company’s success if they enjoy being in the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, CEO of LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee reward and well-being.
Investors make a profit when companies succeed, companies make a profit when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they are of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to have four thousand conversations,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they were heard
Does their opinion matter?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day it is announced on Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of its employees in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
“If a company does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano says.
“If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked female neighbor, according to the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging from a rope outside her window.
According to the woman, the camera on her cell phone was filming in the apartment.
A frightened woman had run into another room to dress.
When the woman arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had first been pulled up, but soon afterwards was lowered to the window again.
A 20-year-old man has admitted to photographing a woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed and police had not been able to return it as evidence.
During the interrogations, the man has admitted to the act, but has denied committing the crime.
The man was quoted as saying that he loved his neighbor “out of his mind.”
According to news agency TT, the man will be charged with the case.
Teachers call for more pay in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed, said Olli Luukainen, Chairman of OAJ on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday payments highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which the review would not in some way involve cuts in the holiday allowance.
In the municipal sector, contracts are likely to be concluded only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages have been established.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s terms of employment will be agreed on in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public sector-educated negotiation organisation.
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is weakening, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, a fixed-term holiday allowance cut will further steepen the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that the equality of basic education needs to be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day extended as NCAA reduced daily workouts from two to one
It's almost 11:00 p.m. A group of UCLA American football players have been left to talk on the other side of the campus' new training ground.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shining with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, players studying at the university's summer courses return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning they meet at half past seven at Wasserman's football center.
"The next three days will be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changes to Tuesday.
The goal of the change was to reduce the workload of the players, but it has extended their days - at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions started after 7 pm. It was difficult to find space in the players’ already full schedules.
Limiting training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the Westwood season that has lasted six seasons of Mora, when the trainings are held at the same time as the summer courses.
Practices are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when actual preparation for the season's opening game begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA's rule change, although it made player schedules even tighter.
“We load them very much for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They're great guys.
I think it'll be easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes drills to outsiders after camp. It's not easy considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security,” Mora said.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film from there exercises on video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of money is paid for the video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I’m not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom for Rwanda
Rwanda will hold a presidential election on Friday, the winner of which is already well known.
Paul Kagame is officially seeking his third term, but in practice he has been instrumental in leading the country since 1994.
It was then that the rebel group RPF put an end to the genocide organized by the extreme Huts.
Kagame was commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for crushing opposition and restricting the freedom of the word, among other things.
He has also been accused, for example, of misrepresenting poverty statistics.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the constitution, which limited the presidency to two terms, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely respected leader.
During his time, Rwanda has undergone social reforms and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has been raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook Fights Fake News by Enhancing Fact Checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to more and more independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company posted a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest spreaders of fake news. Many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016.
The subject has emerged in political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not quickly remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement released in Germany that fact-checking is being tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass through the screen of independent auditors. They also want more background information so they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for the Facebook news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test Related Articles and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Origin of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Castle of Scotney in County Kent is now known from Squeeze's music video as well as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now, in a charming location in the river valley of Bewl, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
“I’m delighted to be able to study a text written by someone who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says yearningly.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from the National Library of Britain. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed the thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because fire was used as lighting at the time.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he or she is on the spot.
I love the archives!”
The writer, who was attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also artists illustrating the book.
In the evening, he “takes whiskey and begins to write.”
The closer history of Scotney is rather unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation’s staff were just starting to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
There were diaries in the archives, letters from the days of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families fought even for one birch.
I thought we should let it go.”
Some of the stories in the book go from castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joins the English peasant rebellion shortly after the castle's completion in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The peasant revolt in England began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion can begin with a riot.
Maybe these events are related?”
The other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a story of a priest that was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler tells the story of Arthur Darrell, a smuggler from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite the scoundrels. They kept getting into debt and buying things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who could court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämenmäki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophication plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he said.
“I didn’t want to go back to this damn thing.”
Russia's worst relationship since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its position in the Ukraine conflict.
“I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to ensuring that tensions do not escalate.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously low level.
Trump called for thanks to Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia, for the poor relations between the two countries.
Vladimir Klitschko to quit rematch against Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitschko, the long-time professional heavyweight world champion of boxing, is ending his career.
Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought professionally 69 times, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him by points in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a wild match by a knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitschko, however, found no motivation for the match.
“I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match,” Klitschko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Check out Klitschko’s reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
This is the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Championship titles of different federations simultaneously.
The Finnish weather moaner spells out the conditions: "Take the vibe"
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken the woman away.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against the pole jumper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn’t even get the small poles to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I’ve competed and practiced here God knows how many times and I’ve never experienced such a fluctuating wind in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season it has been really difficult to keep the jump constant, as there has been such unstable winds in the training, Nikkanen said at the Kaleva Games.
The weather was also in London on Thursday.
It has been quite challenging to get the technology together - whether it's a cold jam or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe away.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad environment.
Thanks to his hall jump of 455 he made it to the World Cup.
There's a 445 out there.
Not everyone in London is the same.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to reach 460 on Friday.
Why don't you move abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technique stabilized.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally I was able to practice in the hall, but now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind is fine as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-official insulted politicians at Yle: "We don't have any room for division now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep the ice in its hat and be careful not to swell the state budget with debt money, says Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets for decades at the Ministry of Finance.
According to him, there is no room for division.
Yle interviewed Virta, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday’s Ykkösaamu.
Next year’s budget is just beginning.
Recently, politicians’ proposals for the release of new ones, such as raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting e-bikes, have been highlighted by Virtanen as election speeches.
They essentially indicate that the elections are near, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I think it’s even a fraud to talk about a divider when debt is taken, Virtanen said to Yle.
He said that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has a long experience in preparing state budgets: he joined the Ministry of Finance in 1978 as Budget Secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Manager.
The last time he retired, he was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the 3% growth forecast is likely to be temporary.
All the forecasters estimate that this is a spike that we will start going downhill next year, and Finland is expecting a growth of one per cent for decades.
Washington to change permanent residence permit rules
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current programme.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy," Trump said.
Queen of Denmark won’t be buried in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried next to each other, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, royal couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” said Lene Belleby, chief of communications at the court.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated on an equal footing with his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a burial place and understands the decision.
Horror moment on the road: The car almost came on the highway
Tommi had a common-law spouse and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law spouse Riina and the couple’s two young children drove on the highway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the exit of Ring III to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which almost drove the family car to the side, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the evasive move, the car would have come with Tommi on top.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand.
The family car collided with the railing at high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is slightly under 3 years old, the other under 1 year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one passed us, even though there was heavy traffic.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
Tommi said that no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and emergency services staff arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says that she and her common-law spouse have a small income, and they received assistance from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information on the other car, Tommi says that the family will not get the money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family is hoping for witnesses to observe the car that caused the family to run into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take the children to the nursery and work without them, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the car's license plate was a SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we still have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen or know something about the incident will be contacted by the police.
It is confirmed from the Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they have had a task at the accident site on Tuesday night.
The title and story were corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally said in the story, the other car did not come in the lane of oncoming passengers, but was driven from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the performance deals with relationships through humor - A self-expressor will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first directing to the What? theatre.
A self-expression is a musical theatre performance about relationships that have gone wrong and inadequacy.
According to the director Lotta Jäppinen, it will still make you feel good.
The subject is addressed through humor.
There are no bad feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a large, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to consider what you reveal about yourself when you meet a new person.
Is he perhaps playing a role or is he approaching the other person with his jacket open?
Unpredictable performance mixes fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the self-expressor does not directly tell about his or her own personal relationships or the working group’s relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own set of values will be passed on by the show.
I don’t think relationships are bad, but I also don’t think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
Many have learned a lot from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
There is no need to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance stars Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jack and Rokan.
Love for the theatre was sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Academy of Arts.
We've got two years behind us and another one ahead of us.
His enthusiasm for the theatre has started over the years.
The student of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted in the Student Theatre in Helsinki and, most recently, in the Linnatteri in Turku.
Management is becoming more and more interesting.
The exhibitionist premiered last week in Helsinki on the stage of the Fool.
The 45-minute performance will also be seen in the future, at least in the student city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Exhibitionist at the What? Theatre in Kouvola on 4 August at 7 pm and 5 August at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of mutual counting toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many types of physical activity on earth that a chemist has not tried at least once.
It inspired me to practice.
There’s always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one of the goals was to completely stop it.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both arms were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I’ve been in my house for a year now, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the accident.
Driving a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't use it to search for boundaries.
It’s just that it’s so hard that it’s not worth doing too much for a 40-year-old!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
In the back was a long run as the head coach of the Japan freestyle national team.
Lahtela started his job immediately after the end of his career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I had to be in my place.
I didn’t really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching period, Lahtela often challenged his protégé in slopes and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a great experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn’t make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because for once I was able to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he is afraid of being burned out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as the coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I switched motocrosses to frisbee golf!
He was out of control right away.
I was at my worst for seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super enthusiastic trainer herself, she does not demand that her trainers be the same as her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
In our species culture, there is room to be what you are and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It’s here: a report on technological advancements in the sex robot industry — just as it had begun to feel like 2017 couldn’t get any stranger.
Oh, yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
“We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the Foundation and professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being moaned, but they are already being sold quite a lot, and we are going to see even more of them," Sharkey said at the announcement of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and AI-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from eye color to nipple shape and fingernail type and color.
All the more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, for example, to be shy.
True Companion Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the mood or in the mood.
There are many worrying features about the prevalence of sex robots. They replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistive, for example.
True Companion compares a Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell us a lot about the spirit of time.
And many people only start acting strangely or offensively when the market allows them to do so.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women’s rights are under threat around the world and there’s a president sitting in the White House who has boasted about harassing women.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale, the most disturbing thing is its powerful imagery, such as images of hanged bodies and eyes dug out. The most disturbing thing is how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
There are attempts to make sex robots as much like real women (on the scale of pornstars) as technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as much as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will of their own and no history — nothing that suggests independence or violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect that two terror attacks were planned in Australia, the group was led by ISIS chief
The chief of the Islamic State group led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb aboard an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the ISIS leaders had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was to be taken on board the plane on July 15, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
Police did not say why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans Australia has ever made.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also ongoing.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
During Trump’s term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong division of voters has also broken up families on an everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers gave advice columns on how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to break out our information bubble.
There has been little attention given to Trump’s ability to bring families together.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been at odds with Republicans in our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including the pro-Republican sibling he’s been arguing with for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that is a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we talk about the scary possibility that one day we won’t be able to dread his tricks anymore.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying chance that Trump will normalize right-wing extremist Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney’s restrained version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and we’ve seen his tax return).
When Trump’s term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be lucid, and it immediately feels like a considerable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Parks Department, and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
Carousel horses are huge, the characters in the middle —the grotesque clowns and the animals looking back in terror —are ominous, and the music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Over time, many of New York City’s hallmarks become disillusioned: the views of tall buildings become bored, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality does not correspond to dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I have not completely gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience —so much so that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their 40s enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but luckily no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked at a department store this week to rate my “payment experience” on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on the reader.
The same thing in the café in my home area, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the 15% service money when I go to get the coffee on the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service agent to put their personality into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The department store saleswoman smiled with regret when I gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter: "There was no trust in management"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq of the role of coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, previously an assistant coach.
The rest of the team will continue in their current positions.
Italian Piccareta has previously served as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England, among others.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter’s coaching team in January, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter’s Chairman of the Board Stefan Håkans regrets what has happened.
Changing your coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the confidence of the club's management, so there was now no other option," Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta’s contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is already responsible for tomorrow’s home game against HIFK.
Ilta-Sanomat reports that the team has been in turmoil all Thursday.
Kuqi told players Thursday morning that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been relegated.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed heavily in Inter's game against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the 1980s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
A number of Hästägit have been added to the picture, on the basis of which one can conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders seriously about a young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he was communicating.
If you can’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of her past and also talked about painful topics.
About a year ago, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she is posing now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text he had added in English hashtags for life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lupenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
At the age of 14, he was hospitalized for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was not finally revealed until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius sent to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which he was given after he fell in a cell, according to prison officials.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too light.
The Attorney General will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be filed as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry said, according to bTV.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and already impose substantial fines on anyone camping outside the designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
Neste's share sinks - already sunk -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's stock has sunk 7.7 per cent at approximately 11.00 a.m.
Its profit before taxes declined but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
Stock exchange trading has started slightly in the cold today, both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock markets opened, the large European Stoxx 600 index had fallen by 0.2%.
After trading for about half an hour, the overall index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange, OMXH, had fallen 0.3 per cent to 9,509.48 points and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had fallen by 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR 9 million was published by Neste.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study argues the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may help relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Irritable bowel syndrome sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, director of the study, immune cells guard the intestine and ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause inflammation are balanced by cells that strengthen resilience. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
The studies found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a specific bacterium in their intestines.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri and cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome,” says Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan in the mice' diet, the more immune cells they had."
If the same thing works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a high-tryptophan diet can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
In a study of immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from another group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of mice, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the mice were tested for intestinal DNA, six species of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice that had grown up in a sterile environment and had no intestinal microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, growing Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferring small amounts of fluids — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’ food, the number of cells that strengthened tolerance increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their prevalence".
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" into their ranks after signing a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" into their ranks after signing a contract with Nemanja Matic. Midfielder debuted with Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Moved from Chelsea for £40 million, Matic started with a 2-1 win at Dublin, United's last game preceding the UEFA Super Cup tournament match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was not in the best shape yet, as he was not on the Blue Shirt Asian tour before the season started. He only managed 45 minutes on the field, which Mourinho says must be changed before the Premier League season starts.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius — he has a natural thinking ability in football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done "great work" by acquiring three of his four preferred players.
"Three out of four - we have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup Qualifying Tournament to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The German standard of play is high.
Their game was steady in every sector,” Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third period, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany is leading the group.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to rock along,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland lost three out of four matches to Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand Jury Sends Challenges to Trump Jr.'s Russia Meeting
In the United States, a grand jury has sent lawsuits in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller has already sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin affiliations.
Reuters, a news agency, confirmed the announcement that the Wall Street Journal had announced Thursday that a grand jury had been convened.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Kremlin-affiliated Veselnitskaya, which took place midway through the US presidential election in June 2016.
Donald Trump Sr.'s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington marks a intensification of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation seeking to investigate Russia's interference in the US presidential election and whether the Trump campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia in the matter.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send subpoenas, and force people to testify under oath.
A great jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence investigated by the prosecutor in the investigation and decides whether charges should be brought in the case.
British inventor microchips himself to get into his home and car with a wave of his hand
The British inventor has been the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a wave of his hand.
The microchip lies between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he provides service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam's BioTeq company.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that of cats and dogs, and only takes 30 seconds to install.
Northam's attempt to make locks on houses and cars compatible with a microchip costs £300 to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit costs thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern lawn for an event featuring American production cost taxpayers $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the President is on board. It was the main attraction of an event held at the White House on 17 July 2017 to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials visited the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, exhibited included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter to be on the scene by mission-specific order only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn for an "exceptional" event. This is shown by documents from the Navy HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an email to his superior, who is the Deputy Commandant of the Navy Air Force the day before the incident.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn field on 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would start at 3 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the scene until after the lawn field was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if a helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed at the scene due to service time restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter's house when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether a second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the incident was in violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act. We were told not to," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favour of the health care reform that was being discussed by the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled the president's campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, which has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," said Lindsay Walters, White House Press Secretary.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House to an accuracy of centimeters.
While Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were included in the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day on "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said there were no other costs for taxpayers.
A spokesperson for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence's 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico Base in Virginia to the White House and back took a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating a helicopter is significantly lower.
"The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and, as a result, employ probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to bring it up.”
It is not clear whether Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the seat of the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Flash hits Vaasa railway line - trains have to be replaced by buses
Passenger rail traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa has been interrupted due to a technical fault, reports the Railway Traffic Centre.

Venezuelan prosecutor calls for right to block appointment of country's new representative council
The Venezuelan state prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new representative council in the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that a council elected last Sunday is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a council of representatives was elected for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the decision had been requested due to allegations of fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the position after a British company that held a representative council vote reported that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated to the council, and the elected 545-member council includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Representative Council can dissolve the Congress led by the opposition and change the laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees amending the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have said they will not recognise the new council.
Maduro argues that the new council is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Many people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into economic crisis after oil prices dropped.
Today, many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new council is due to start.
Russian Man Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison in the United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite protests from the Russians, according to the news agency AFP.
In March of this year, he was found guilty of computer fraud, which had generated a profit of millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving a prison sentence.
Russia’s foreign ministry criticized Finland hard after the arrest and said that the man could not be extradited to the United States.
In the statement, Finland and the United States were accused of having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for user names and passwords.
The scammers then used the information to continue directing internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Department of Justice's Crime Department, the incident shows that the United States is capable of pursuing cybercriminals who are also active in others.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Edited at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected the transcription of the condemned person's name.
Narcos Season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali Cartel will star in Netflix hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.

Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a recent trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits U.S. and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional work of light art in honour of the first Light Day set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola makes a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I feel are important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola of his work.
I am very pleased with the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art as part of the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters to celebrate the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-implement my art at UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may expand significantly.
We will announce this later this autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at the UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fought in a shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had an argument in the Iso Omena shopping centre parking hall in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute originated when the other party accidentally drove in a forbidden direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver driving in a forbidden direction struck the driver of another car, resulting in his car moving, colliding with the hitter's car.
He then hit the hood of the still colliding car.
In a preliminary speech, the man admitted that he caused the damage and that he had done wrong.
Timo Soini, with a question mark, wrote: "After that came the Flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post titled with a question mark on Thursday.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs in government.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of Soini contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the parable of the Flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases "after us the Flood" or "after me the Flood" have remained in the books of history.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
Elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the United Nations Delegation for Aid, stated that hundreds of women are running for election in provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
The Afghan Provincial Council and Presidential Elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year’s election is the first time that power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that the contribution of women will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering restricting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: stay for only a few hours and rush through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is suffocated by day trips to the city by tourists.
The narrow streets are hard to get around and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center, while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours.
You will follow the flag-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square, and you will turn back,” Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini said in a statement.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic center of Venice.
On the edge of the square is the Church of St. Mark.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic center of Venice.
In 1951 the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has reduced their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the residents away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years Venice will be nothing but tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historic disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
This is a difficult equation, as the vessels bring the much-needed income to Venice and create a need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been planned that cruisers would go further away from the historic centre.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited by about 20-30 million tourists every year.
Are you driving around in Kuopio?
Traffic jams on motorways for miles
On the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the northbound lane has had kilometres of traffic jams during the return traffic from work on Thursday afternoon.
Motorway coating work is carried out in the area, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50 km/h speed limit for road works instead of the standard 120 km/h speed.
Even within the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon at a practically pace of walking.
Road work proceeded on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the statue of Revelation, or Golden Capricorn.
I get along fine without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has had to notice the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published some great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has emerged as a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400 metres run in March by touring at the time of the circuit 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 metres fence run at the time of Norway's record of 55.38.
Iuel, a busy social media user, soon after his records found that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began sending Luel pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
“I got a lot of ‘scrumptious photos’ from strangers, so I had to turn my account into a private one,” Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of photos he received.
You can guess, Luel laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after a run, but I can do well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then to Pakistan, because of her father’s work.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has a lot more time to deal personally with the athlete,” Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
Snowboarder Janne Korve's foot injury puts his career at risk - now included in the World Cup: "It's nice not to hurt anything"
It’s been nice to count that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to really enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, his career was at stake.
A strain injury on the foot had forced Korve on the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to get better.
His hand had been hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I didn’t know what I was going to do or not.
Sponsorship deals were broken and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
But that’s what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back on the slope again.
After that, the next decision was easy.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
I was like, "Damn, this is so much fun, let's do a couple more seasons."
Korpi was able to count properly only in September and October, but after a long break, just training painless has been a big deal.
The race has only been around a few.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of surfing for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you’re in a fever for that week.
I don’t think so, the Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races do not like him in the field of surfing, from racing in tough company he always lights up.
According to Korvi, the recognition of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over the past few years, although some of the riders chose the Norwegian X-Games to be held at the same time.
This is a big race, the visibility is big.
In my opinion, it always depends on the conditions and the level of competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team’s juniors, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It’s nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point when everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings new power to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the slopes, but otherwise I don't have that much power in my friends!
Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career in the background of his boarding career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to race sports: the rider has his own racehorses, for which he makes training programs.
When I’m on the road all the time, I don’t have time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the race results and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korvi, race guidance and race coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end in due course.
I don’t want to go that far, but it’s at least an option.
I feel like I’m studying it in addition to snowboarding.
I try to stay on my nerves and develop, maybe in the summer I’ll be driving something.
If it’s my future career, then it’s not hard to get started when you’re already in the sport.
Ravintolat also includes the Elitloppet cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that will head to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
Now we are at the point where there is no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months to go, let’s hope the ship is full,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project to Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seat nursing home for elderly people to be built in Kitee.
The 1,700 square meter building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbor’s Health Road.
A common cause for wondering at Kite is where customers will be able to find the new treatment unit, as many private nursing homes are now short of customers during Siu’s war.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Director of Nursing Services, comments that Kitee will have more demand in the future not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kitee in Kanervikkola and Eerika.
The deal concerned business, but the property is reportedly under a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations out of these spaces.
More on this topic later today.
GMB is concerned about McVitie's Scottish factory's continued operation
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's cookie manufacturer executives for a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of the General Trade Union of the UK GMB said the company had not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The Hobnobs and Rich Tea Biscuits and other products factory has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be "certainly the first to be told" if there are any changes to the operations.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company "to respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines".
Drew Duffy, a GMB trade union, finds it very worrying that the factory manager does not have clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is strongly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and low income.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising cost of living, and a continuing reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to a spokesperson for Pladis, the factory manager had only received a trade union letter the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates the constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
In recent years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a manufacturing facility and will be the first to inform employees and trade union representatives if we plan to make any changes to the plant's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga May Regret His Interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up his pursuit of Neymar after paying a transfer sum of £189 million to terminate the contract. But did PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked-about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfers. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest paid professional athlete, as PSG will offer him a salary of over £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be outraged by the PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona says that Neymar has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking the best players at PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they go after our players, we will become their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they are after our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have been guilty of just this: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Comparet earlier this summer.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar as a result.

Trump’s phone calls were made up, White House spokesperson: “I wouldn’t say it was a lie”
The White House admits that two of the calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incendiary phone calls with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the Boy Scouts' Organization have proven to be made up.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had taken place.
He said Trump wasn’t lying.
According to Sanders, many of the Scouts' leaders spoke to Trump personally, and with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump had spoken at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face to face.
Speech to the Scouts sparked disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump’s success in tackling illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that very few people will ever cross the southern border of Mexico because they know that the trip will end at the U.S. border.
The Mexican government released a statement on Wednesday saying that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a meeting of the National Scouting Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Scouts' organization announced that it is not aware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the statement, the organization's leader Michael Surbaugh's previous statement, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for his speech, speaks for himself.
Trump’s speech at the Boy Scouts’ Association meeting caused a lot of confusion, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn’s presidential election.
