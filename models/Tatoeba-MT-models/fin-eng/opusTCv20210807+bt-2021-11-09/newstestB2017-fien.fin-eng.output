28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local mall staircase this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Forensics Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he became a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that the death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small and tight team, like a family. Our regret is great," the spokesperson says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally gotten his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices that took place in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the incident will be asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline 415-575-4444.
Junior strikers call for new military action
Representatives of British junior doctors (which in Finland are mainly specialised doctors) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new industrial action in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), which is part of the British Trade Union for Physicians (BMA), is asking its entire government for support for further industrial action starting in early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter to members of the JDC on Twitter Thursday evening, saying the government had "insistently kept silent" on issues that, according to McCourt, led to a rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: "In the light of this, the JDC government has voted down a completely new draft treaty and is calling for further formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government asking for permission for progressively advancing expanding industrial action since early September."
As a result of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawia, director of junior doctors at the BMA, resigned after a vote for not accepting the negotiated terms of contract that had been recommended by the BMA.
Malawia told BMA members at pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally conclude the eight-month-long war on words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin and he didn’t see much heat, even by his own reticent standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I couldn’t keep track of myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I saw his enthusiasm in the opposite way.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
But suddenly it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
Most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the allegations.
The official message from St. Petersburg, however, was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only held to give Putin the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a severe truce are clear.
Most of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost ousted last month in a failed coup d'état.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motivation for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will surely breathe a sigh of relief when air traffic can finally continue.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkey's agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in the economic magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West is reacting subduedly to the attempted coup d'état.
Not to forget the old resentment over the snail-paced EU accession negotiations with Turkey and Putin’s interference, who is eager to take advantage of cool relations and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities following the coup attempt.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own persistent concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, at their summit in a spectacular seaside palace, were able to convey an image described by an analyst as an "alignment of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most notable is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not addressed the issue at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question about the differences between the two countries, while Putin in turn emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries as to where they can seek an agreement in Syria.
Given the prospect of a total disaster caused by the shooting down of a Russian combat aircraft by a NATO member country, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two Heads of State are again speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the RBS Governor, the bank’s operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally related to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank was forced to back away from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to introduce more national brands to the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, "RBS is turning into an investment brand and that's what our staff are working for because we are now turning into a bank of much more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sponsorship of sports.
“Now is the right time to switch to a bank with different brands, because basically it’s about how we can make the bank better for our customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
"Three years ago, it would have been very derisory if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs rather than our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory at Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, marking his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same evening at the track of his own locality.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races running on a flat track.
He has previously been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are sore because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and an audience of 20,000.
I feel relieved and very humble.”
Dettori accepts cheers with Predilection after his win
The two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle racing, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's no surprise that he just reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is classy and strong, but his tactical skill is what sets him apart.
He is a fantastic representative for race riding, his enthusiasm and qualifier has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he didn't compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie’s riding career at the UK Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to watch.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in a emblematic way by flying off his horse.
"From flying finishes to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been a model of British racing for two decades.
There are ups and downs.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous win at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but has also survived a plane crash and been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban came to an end three years ago, he had trouble starting at first, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his skeptics, and returned to his best.
And he’s not ending his career for a while yet — Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he’s at least 50.”
Putin dismisses Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed his government chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a statement issued by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been the deputy chief of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the presidential protocol department and the government office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how the instructions you give are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for his resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As chief of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting shown on Russian state television with President Putin, each said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they fired as a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been acclaimed as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website presents Ivanov's words to Putin in which he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this very complicated and, to some extent, even a difficult job for four years.
I have now served as the President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's immediate circle, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and then returned to office just three and a half years later.
'Criminal Minds: FBI Investigators' star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said they were fired in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner on the show, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative differences.
I’m sorry this happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been part of the series since its first season, which began in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have been putting my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
"I was hoping to see the series through, but that's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, the producers, the actors, our great production team and the most important ones: the best fans the show could ever have hoped for."
Season 12 of the series will begin on September 28 in the United States.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are sandeel that have fallen to land as cyclone sucks.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to get an answer to the appearance of these five-centimetre fish.
The Queensferry Overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and land bridge of the Queensferry overpass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "deck fans", which are now almost complete around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30 000 concrete and steel used for the construction of this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, chief of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a major urine pole in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the top of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower column, we then had to close the remaining northern (i.e. ground) gap.
This was done by pulling a north-facing land bridge 700 millimeters southwards.
This was a massive operation and at the same time a high degree of precision.
Massive because the ground bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3%.
And demanding high precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went well.”
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells about the miraculous rescue of three men
Three men from their fishing boat off Anglesey were miraculously rescued.
Moelfre RNLI's sea rescue station made an alert on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew detected an accident in Moelfre Bay Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless passage without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circle around right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives Moelfre's lifeboat.
"By the time we reached the waters, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted, clinging to a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle that these three men who have fallen into the water are still alive and in perfect condition.
The boat's engine had an emergency extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had come off the man who was driving the boat at the time of the crash.
They were really lucky on their way."
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, screen time only took watching TV, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It is important to note that technology and outdoor exercise are not mutually exclusive.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters originated from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made into a cartoon series, playing cards and other peripherals).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of Pokémon Go users passed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out on their smartphones to find Pokémon that are tracked by GPS. Once a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using a phone screenshot) or "captured".
The fad has caught up with the generation that played the video game when they were younger and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported, from Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company doesn’t know which user is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the physical activity data.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic things that support health: exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disapproving mirths.
And yes, someone can walk through the door.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity in the past, they didn’t give you a reason to start like Pokémon Go does.
The charm of novelty disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games combining apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people going on a hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless at the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Great at everything.
Finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old gymnast in the United States won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than that of silver-ranked "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
U.S. Simone Biles will perform at the boom in the women's rack gymnastics individual competition multi-match finals on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus consolidating her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best ever.
Biles burst into tears when his final score became visible and his long road to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and puts him in the same class as other sports superstars such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in his sport for the past three years. He has won 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, and earned them with programs so ambitious and punctual that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest rack gymnast of all time".
In Brazil, there was still one final race to be held, first and foremost between Bales and himself and the burden of over-expectation, rather than between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas for less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.

Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of the i for the departure of Martha Karolyi, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance since he had been at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program — which includes a volt series known as his trump card — is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Having been adopted by his grandparents as a child and found by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman has become a powerful figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare excursion in the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match race since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead on two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a permanto where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead with 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points from the permanence.
He was gently hugged by Raisman as they waited for the final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear in Biles’ red, white, and blue around the glittering crop color when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch to the race four years ago when he first shared third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team's "grandmother", was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent out air kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from a losing position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old tweet made earlier in the week and widespread now has a whole new meaning:
Police report that three people who listened to music in the car were victims of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest massacre in ten years. The victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a statement released Thursday.
Officials said on June 12 a car parked along the street was shot and killed by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped with another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple killing may not have been the cause of the robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags and the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
A spokesperson for Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in Hispanic-populated areas within four months.
"The events have in common that they have occurred in residential areas outside homes," Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
A witness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police released a statement reporting the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple murder. The shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found casings and recovered fragments from the car seat and from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: 'Things get better'
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, due to a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, that she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn’t get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and may not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was any such practice anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund sat up and started crawling until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he is slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of a sign by which he means "sing for me".
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean standard sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zikavirus.
Symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to estimate how it will affect the lives of people with Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, 'What's going to happen to us,
What will happen to us."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
The Louisiana governor declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flood over their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of strong heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the National Security and Emergency Preparedness Bureau, said the agency was receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
According to the weather service, there may be an additional 76 to 27 mm of water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each in Louisiana, are predicted to reach record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers can be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as flooded rivers slowly drain Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9:00 a.m.
Rescue work continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The other half of the boy who lived nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water came in with constant feeding," Hansford says.
"It extended to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only one capable of swimming.
Rescue workers had rescued all three on a large army-style truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held cover on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports information from an observer near Livingston that nearly 350 mm of rain had occurred between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil became heavily wet after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Officials report that due to heavy rains and flooding of streets, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that 200 homes were under flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County director Robby Miller says authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
For the evacuations, shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to retreat," he says.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
"The last time we experienced a major flood in March," said Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood appears to be similar."
In Mississippi, rains continued flat along the Gulf of Mexico coast, according to Rupert Lacy, the Harrison County Rescue Director.
Lacy reports that a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no information had been received so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store, has been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before, and it’s raining all the time.”
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets in his body, survives the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot dead in Philadelphia, the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents reported on CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the television network.
"I can't believe this is real."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was filled with assault weapon-type shells originating from various assault weapons.
"It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were casings on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
There have been several armed fighters at the scene and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old victim of shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
This is what I call the women's Olympic gymnastics team, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many girls of color.
The team line-up, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female stand gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the amazing performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as well as surprising and masterful gymnastics programs.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American on Thursday to win gold in a multiple-match women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won the silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but the same does not look the same in gymnastics classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic team in rack gymnastics, and this will be Marta Karoly's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most scaffolding gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of scaffolding gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and that means an expensive and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached sports enthusiasts since they began rack gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and more accessible gymnastics education for the countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided free or affordable opportunities for gymnastics for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly Black and Hispanic), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked the excitement of thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and that’s just great.
Participation in a particular sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true “girl power” you showed in winning the Olympic gold medal and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialised doctors, voted against the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force an agreement and said Britain's public health system (NHS) was "on nobody's land" and that any further delays would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors move to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's junior medical committee, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors continue to be very reserved about the proposed deal, with particular fears that it will accelerate the current labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we must now move on, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has treated the attempts at discussion reluctantly and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
In spite of the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for further industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointment times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the strike doctors on strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with officials from the British trade union representing doctors.
Trade union BMA wants better weekend pay for 54,000 junior doctors affected by the deal.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS employees, called on junior doctors not to engage in further strikes.
Mortimer says: "Largely little or nothing is achieved through industrial action, but it puts pressure on teams and services already operating at the extremes and causes concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been holding negotiations with the Committee on Junior Medicine, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the detection of grievances.
Employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector — was a sign of how seriously employees, Health Education England, which is responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A daily dose of $2.40 can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a medication costing around €2.40 per day, as authorities recommended it for more people and longer-term use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), part of the British Public Health System (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, around 140,000 people have a heart attack every year, with a quarter of them having a heart attack or having a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fatty substance that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if a blood clot comes off, it can travel with the bloodstream and prevent blood from flowing to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of another attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor produced by the British company AstraZeneca, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of stoppers.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and additional aspirin administered twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for the Evaluation of the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: “While effective treatments are available to effectively prevent the progression of disease and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have another attack or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have found that ticagrelor combined with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, when used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of a treatment method for a longer period.
Because of the climate of political correctness, voter fraud in Muslim areas flourished
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government
A climate of political correctness led to the closing of the eyes to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticizes the police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to election fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
Pickles, known as a former regional government minister and current anti-corruption force figure, said the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity document in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only has to give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes dipping fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to whistleblowers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access for journalists to government documents and decisions by informal boards and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for an explanation after the voting scandal at Tower Hamlet in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered the then mayor Lutfur Rahman to resign due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "falsely distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as a basis for his campaign the fact that it was the religious duty of every Muslim of the believer to vote for him."
As many as 300 of the votes were questioned or fraudulently given, with the person voting by pretending to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of the fraud was obtained throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about postal election fraud, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an ID at the polling station.
The report states: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, particularly in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh backgrounds."
"There was concern that... the institutions of the state had turned a blind eye to such activities because of a 'politically correct' hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots to political activists in order to prevent "harvesting votes".
Theresa May's current report also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
Dipping fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting the processing of filled votes sent by post and mail voice envelopes to political activists.
The right of the police to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibiting photography at polling stations.
Allowing only English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff enforces the rule that only one person at a time may enter a voting booth.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes the London police and finds it "astounding" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representatives for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticized the inefficient "tick checks" of the departments responsible for the City Council electoral lists.
"The court's ruling last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by worrying and covert electoral fraud and its denial by some."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers rumble at Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the title who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the U.S. men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine’s doppelganger seen on the bike tracks, many people have quoted on social media how an archer could be the twin brother of the actor’s favorite Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm after photos of him posted on Twitter, in which he strikingly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise of social media and admitted to having heard since childhood that he resembles DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance as that big, except maybe a beard and a mustache," said Brady to the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
At the 2012 London Games, the similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris was raised, which is undoubtedly brought up even more in these games.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been dubbed the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
The South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison of the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in Inception.
Similarly, the similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, highlighted by their powerful eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Yulia Efimova of Russia resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team is, according to his fans, "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Not only that: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance as well.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the resemblance of the couple.
One tweeter recently expressed his delight when "others on the internet agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and Dexter’s actor are truly strikingly reminiscent of each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Many have also noticed similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Burns! starring Gabrielle Union in wide smiles.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer 'dead as a pig'
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay shocked viewers of CBC's live Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "disappeared smelly" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the final of the women's 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who was included on the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, took off fast and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay at 1:57.79, and missed 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, allowing the Canadians to swim to catch China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did a CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet."
In the finals of the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay, Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with frenzied Byron MacDonald criticizing comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back when they heard how indifferent Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group. #reluctant."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment made about the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted its apologies to comments from over 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The television company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and that they made it to the broadcast.
On last night's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to excuse his speech by saying he did not mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay swim," MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I did not mean anything derogatory by my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, a woman fitting underwear in the middle of the store shocked customers.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on her underwear.
He further worsened the situation by evaluating what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his leg, and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried out four pairs of panties at a store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says: “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants, and put them on.
He did not try to do it inconspicuously, but he did it with complete shame.
Everyone was staring as he took the underwear he was trying off his feet and apparently didn’t like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn’t like any of them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks — and he wasn't thinking about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had tried."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues, "How disgusting to think someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and hasn't washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
"I have understood that shop staff tried to remove the items from sale after the woman had left — which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without washing them after that," adds Davidson.
Primark's spokesperson commented on the matter saying, "Primark is aware of the situation that occurred on Tuesday, August 9, in its Folkestone movement.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York City, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun at close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with the knee into the groin, and when he goes double out of pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and back off by holding the gun aimed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the weapon and strike the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash, unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
World Traveler Ian Wright Licks Europe's Dirtyest Places
The British World Traveler put his resistance and gagging reflex to the test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking a euro banknote, handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet, and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects with a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was sticking his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the trail of inner strength, and its results surprised me.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train toilet can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of good gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Undoubtedly, licking the handrails of railway stations and the toilet flush button challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "Since I was a child, I have been quite unconcerned about my health and put all sorts of things in my mouth, such as soil, worms, and curd water."
In the film, he really showed himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The border was crossed only in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, it should be noted that in newly washed hands, the number is usually less than 60.
The border came across in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units - in freshly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright co-creates the documentary film Ian Wright: The Inner Power, which makes visible the amount of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here at all."
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright on the trail of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilusta containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for snacks, juices and novelties at Valio, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time coming up with something crazy, and eventually we ended up with the idea of asking Ia to come along."
Gut health has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Gut health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The movie is also about our sense of humor!”
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "Let's say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks filmed on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of the respondents connected lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 per cent said that they used products with added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A troubled family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
The troubled family left behind £50,000 in damage to a city-owned rental house after they were evicted due to neighborhood terror.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find that the apartment was in repair condition.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been spread on the floors, and walls had been tarnished with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be salvaged.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the terror of the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and dealing, and loud shouting, arguing, and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease agreement, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
In several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old debris was found.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been ripped off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency forcibly evicted the couple this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We’ve been living in their neighborhood for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called in regularly.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This incident was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to watch for the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Housing workers must now clean up the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis plus scales and other supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved into a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were tarnished with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without prosecution, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-trapped military jet scares tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion plane crashed at a staggering low altitude.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicking when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
The dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes almost within touch distance of sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers got on their feet when they were understandably concerned about the thunder of jet engines that began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who shot the dramatic flyby and posted the videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice as low as it really was, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggering low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by dense fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote’s results for the first half of the year better than expected
Etelä-Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a profit of EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment was carried out in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues.
The exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining portion may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Swore in Military Oath in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in on Friday.
A military oath ceremony for the conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The oath ceremony of the 10th Special Frontier Ranger Course was held on the garrison's sports field.
The military was sworn in by 70 conscripts.
Special Border Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to join the Special Border Rangers.
250 of them were invited to take the entrance exams.
Special Border Rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the oath was attended by five veterans of the wartime frontier forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
Criminal intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has operated an RTA unit, i.e. a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant stationed in the Bay.
The chief of staff is an inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian outfit.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of the working methods of the police.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the scene until they received an alarm.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, daily police work is targeted where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units, and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas subdivided according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's task is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one’s own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method, the perpetrator forms a certain kind of image.
The placement can be done either on the basis of the manner in which the act was committed or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of the methods used, both by themselves and by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
The police will publicly disclose the procedures if they anticipate that they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which empty homes were marked in early summer, used in house burglaries.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, pin or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to test whether the residents were actually traveling.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis team has found that the most professional criminals are learning from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the minutes of the district court, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves will go with their gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to plan practical activities.
This is due to the reduction in the number of employees and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl joined in ISIS killed in Syria
News reports that one in three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasname Akunjee, said the girl’s family had heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, which is an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a testament to people's understanding that this is a real risk when entering a war zone - and that will cause people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other schoolgirls from East London, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court Justice if elected president.
Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
According to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton would choose Garland with "quite a great deal of certainty."
Reid's spokesperson later specified that this was merely speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "swallow the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District Court of Columbia County.
Reid says Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "commanders" and "advices" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He says Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in the 1970s style and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw reported earlier this year that his nudity-stricken magazine is different from old-school Playboy magazines, as he says, "Playboy is for men.
I do this to women.”
He seems to think the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back a timeless and classic nudity where women, like men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that praise the female body without any effort,” Shaw said in a press release.
"Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to be a model in the calendar can submit their photos online or attend open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry protest under the name NoivaAll LonelyMiddle-agedMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, behind the re-emergence of much-spoken vinyl records is not a millennial-generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but rather a mid-life nostalgia.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just the desire of enthusiasts to collect records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are the YouGov results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked down the bustling Soho Street, wearing a plain grey jacket suit. I would gesture livelyly, bend my hand into a cup and say something traditional, such as, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets, and Paperchase chains have taken over before farms owned by private entrepreneurs, however, a handful of specialty record stores remain.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to observe their age and character.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (customers at the time two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (customers at the time eight middle-aged men, one probably 20-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends his extra time exploring what shops are offering.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 3,000 records."
These plates fill his living room walls, as you can see from the photo. (Stuart sent me a photo by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they first appeared, and to re-buy things he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy being around themselves, adding, "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
It's my evil."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people who have been affected by media hype. These people have heard about the re-emergence of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on the conversations I had had, people had usually given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
What, then, about the alleged emotional significance of sound recordings?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been upset especially with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may fascinate some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and a reminder of the happy days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills a gap or material possessions into some kind of consolation," says Wez.
"This is how I see it as a collector myself, and I think so do many others.
It’s an easy way to get your mind off things.”
"We're like social workers!" shouts Wez's co-worker from behind the pile of records.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to their record.
The poll also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers don’t have a record player of their own at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl records also involves a "pocalyptic phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a vendor of the Sounds of the Universe movement (customers at the time three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came into the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The percentage of such customers is not great, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting out as a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, where I will arrive next. The store has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl records.
Clients include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is a delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous stores: instead of rocking jazz from the speakers, Wild Beasts’ latest sex-drilling synthesizer pop.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He's more watching than shopping.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
The music is easy to listen to on the computer or otherwise, but the finer part is ...", he lets off a lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a bunch of teenage girls who you would think would be hopping on jeans shorts, but instead flock around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one is looking at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some are so high that you can’t even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" decor.
But given that any means of getting attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few clients on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the population that is most likely to have more time and money than most people is also the group that spends the most money on luxuries such as vinyl records.
Although my research suggests that YouGov’s results are correct, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans who actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly won’t spend their Thursday mornings hanging around in record stores on Berwick Street, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old TV presenter who stares intimidatingly and stares at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark scientist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 12 years.
French court rejects application to dismantle jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities calling for the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities made allegations that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 temporary stores set up in a refugee camp. The stores sell various items to the residents of the refugee camp, from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts. In temporary restaurants, you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais prefects, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the camp's growing population.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal ground for the expulsion of 72 temporary shopkeepers, but found the concerns of the Calais Prefect "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of much greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they provide peaceful places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to the camp's hundreds of unaccompanied minors, who are in the most vulnerable position.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling for the children's café to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the jungle camp's population has risen to a record, over 9,000 people.
Food prices in Finland fall much faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the detriment of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen second most in those EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In comparison countries, only the UK has seen food prices fall faster than in Finland.
The data are available from a post by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager at Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn, after which food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now being weighed down by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
The major retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the comparison countries, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and price competition must continue,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations with the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
Anyone returning to school may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a rule that all Finnish schools operate in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead the schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education will start in sixth grade at the latest, and social studies will start with four.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found: Ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
The Greenland shark swims along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
The females stretch longer than the males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the monitors, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have forcibly lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimetre amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are more than four metres old, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann to fire nearly 300 sellers
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
“As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, most of which will be made redundant,” Stockmann said in a statement.
It does not reduce the number of department store sellers so that customer service is not affected.
In addition, about 80 support employees will be offered new jobs as vendors.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of the project, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
This is due to Stockmann’s difficulties in making department store sales profitable.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
“Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018,” Veijalainen said in a statement.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second quarter net sales and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was EUR 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees in the whole country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are also showers of rain in the central parts of the country, but further south is the Poutai.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury is below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, it remains between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius.
Kenyan Athletics Team Shaked Up by Doping Scandal - A Strange Explanation for Coach's Rapture
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it was revealed that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete that Anzrah was trying to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya's national team leader, reported that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home as he "did his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kenya's Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino, in turn, thundered at the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year and is a pre-eminent Rio winner favourite.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team in turn claimed that Anzrah passed an athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race village.
When he was confronted by anti-doping officials, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid he would be exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium is empty.
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
Rio started a fight for athletic medals on Friday, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to show their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers reported on Friday that only 58 percent of the first-day morning tickets and 65 percent of the evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheery crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics has already attracted attention before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medal-hops Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the crowd was full.
After the Brazilian duo, Holland played against Russia, and the crowd of 12,000 was only about 30% full.
The poor sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly a lower number than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over 1,000 euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less well-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the Copacaba sands has not been of interest to the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
The foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can cash in on the holder rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right to possess it in return for payment.
The holder receives a veto on his 187 square metre block, which means in practice that not every holder is required to have an approval if the purpose of use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for several segments.
Acquiring a right to govern is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” says Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control the company.
The person who has acquired the right to control receives precise location information from their block, which makes it possible, for example, to visit the block.
The names of the holders of the rights are displayed on the Foundation’s website on the same map where the parcel data of the land area can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation acquisition only as a risk that the foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation was established as a non-profit foundation with the aim of promoting the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the foundation would operate in some way unethical or commercial, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchasing or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holder rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves are the worst in big cities in Turku - see the situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku the biggest cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts were stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August this year, calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
“In some cities there are twice as many thefts as in others,” says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Finnish Police Board.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the ranking.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The frequency of thefts can be influenced by how much bikes are used in the city and how many bikes there are in general,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikkäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the top spot in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and plenty of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are far away from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport,” says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bike thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts each year.
That means 50-60 bikes every day and around 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime of bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police will survive.
A typical cleared-up bike theft is one where the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in blood.
“There are also cases in connection with other investigations, when, for example, in a drug case, stolen bikes may be found in the apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or during a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars in shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term personal use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it has not been known to the police that the stolen bikes go abroad much," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a hidden offence or offence.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underpriced price,” Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries her colourful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of her working day.
He's had five bikes, but not one has been stolen, the Moose says. "He's never been taken, he's had a good monk."
“Perhaps this doesn’t attract thieves so much, it doesn’t necessarily have hipster value either,” the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who had visited a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike swung the kiosk against the wall, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
“I’m going to think about it quite a lot, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own,” says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"I'm always hearing from my friends that bikes have been stolen."
"Mostly bad bikes, such snotty Jopos".
A bicycle was stolen from the apartment company’s courtyard a year ago.
Although the bike was unlocked, Valve was waiting for it to be stolen.
Children under the age of 15 are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki tests peer-to-peer jurors familiar from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
A peer-to-peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a youngster.
The idea is for the peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may himself join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Affairs, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are guiding the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after their first crime, the young person does not face an adult panel but reflects on the event with approximately the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 have not necessarily been dealt with at all before.
“It’s been a message to keep going on the path you’ve chosen,” Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working will be offered to all those in need, not only to immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft of it to see.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be redirected instead of the Trump campaign to congressional elections.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record unpopularity threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majorities in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have exhibited dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced the details of her economic policies on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure — roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American workers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paid jobs since World War II.
We are builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the status of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the exit tax,” Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As [the President], I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this."
Trump's proposed cut to corporate taxes, Clinton has previously termed Trump a "loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making the products himself in America,” Clinton said.
These are the ratings for Rio: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports competitions are shown in television viewing statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympic Games in Rio have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: the swimming on Tuesday evening was followed by 615,000 spectators from YLE’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers at a time, and the European Football Championships were well over a million.
So far, most of the Olympic sports have been interested in Sunday night cycling and gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and points out that the spectators will be divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns watch the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympic Games.
On the television side, too, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast is 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the weak interest - if anyone thinks it is weak - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the start of the games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is only just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
In the beginning, the number of spectators has been close to what was expected.
When athletics starts, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the Apple App Store during the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'm guessing we're going to be about 200,000 downloads now.
"We'll only get the ratings later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as well for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics can be seen on Yle’s canals and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last that can only be followed by Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to the official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Ristenselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre depression on Ristiselkä, whose bottom depth was 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
“There may well be unknown depths,” Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by average depth, it is the Great Juka Lake, 23 meters.
Viewed in this way, Päijänne cannot reach the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes of average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax reduction: Pensioner’s taxation continues to tighten
Pensioners’ taxation is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the grievances emerged in the run-up to the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage and salary earners.
This is not included in the Government's proposal.
In our opinion, it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the election, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that eased taxation.
The issue heated opposition representatives in the parliament, who grilled the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb about election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy on tax reductions presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don't add to people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä’s (center) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He said that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in handy because the economy is so much dependent on domestic demand and people's own confidence in the future.
Tackling long-term unemployment in the threshing
Ihalainen calls on the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists to Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who stated that they were opposed to the law.
Thailand’s southernmost provinces are experiencing ethnic-national conflict over the Muslim population, Westphalen said.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big local holiday in Bangkok, says Westphalen.
The city celebrates the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police say attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police said.
At least four people have died in Thailand in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourist-friendly Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on the holiday island of Phuket, a popular tourist destination in Finland, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A popular tourist attraction in Hua Hin has exploded, according to local authorities, a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bombings.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang each.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it takes you to the Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is not known.
The leader of Thailand's ruling military junta, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, said the perpetrator of the attacks is yet to be known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks were linked to Hua Hin and Trang.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators had been intent on destroying tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but the instructions of the Embassy on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
Last night’s attack in Hua Hin was reported.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the sight.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The chief of police, interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins Women's Quadruple
U.S. Alexandra Raisman was second with a score of 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustaf was third with a performance of 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still seeking rack championships at the Rio Games in permand, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to a large extent over the past few years.
He won eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permannon championships three times in a row, as well as the boom last year and the previous year.
In the United States team, Biles has achieved two team competition world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai entrepreneur: ‘Isku has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the bombings on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think this will lead to anything more amazing, says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t even expelled the tourists, they probably won’t either.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called at about 9 a.m. local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were set for the queen’s birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday’s holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street shops were allowed to open at about ten o’clock local time.
Many people on the beach had never heard of the attack.
By 3:30 p.m. during the Thai time on Patong, traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later that car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
By the time the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby fir.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russia’s leadership changes: Clear displacement
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking change in leadership in years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that recycling management positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating power independent of the President.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in skirmishes with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Mr Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high on the agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
During the Soviet Union, Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old Guards, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Research Fellow Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place is Putin’s changing his immediate circle to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw from Syria
They used civilians as human shields to flee to the city of Yarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took control of about 90 percent of the ISIS-important city of Manbij last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier, we misreported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, civilians were kidnapped by ISIS fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s document disclosure policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful,” says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that public access to documents cannot be based on the authorities’ own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior’s events to Ilta-Sanomi.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office and on the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry’s Communications Director tells the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time.
He injured his back thigh early in the season and was forced to miss the Jamaica Olympic qualifying.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
“I’ve practiced well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and journalists who became fans.
Porina Bolt highlights the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and sliding interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the 200 m early rounds with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he crushed the world record and rivals' self-confidence despite the final celebration, with a time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the top of his career, measuring by clock.
World records of 9.58 at 100 metres and 19.19 at 200 metres in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second under-record, but no one believes in creating it except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens' 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
In the Beijing World Cup final last year, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals if he has made the journey.
In Daegu 2011, the 100s World Cup final was missed by Bolt due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt will turn 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the last goal line of his career.
These are the Olympics that set me apart.
I'm older, and it's harder.
But whenever I’m down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,” Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
A sample of Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home for giving a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent an athletic coach home from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in a test and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800 metres runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't stop at all - historic gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in the 200 metres in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win Olympic gold of the same sport in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mix ahead of Wang Shuni of China.
I’m just trying to have a little fun,” Helen Skelton, the BBC Olympic swimming commentator, laughs during a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton on Monday is the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about her revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revealingness - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
Back steps are not allowed.
It’s important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to thrill and maybe even startle, but he stresses that he doesn't want to be in the lead.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus should be on athletes.
It doesn’t matter how I dress.
Can you believe that this has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me.
You know what?
It is a stir from nothing if it comes from the dress of the host.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests on suspicion of terrorism
Rio police said Thursday they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the games.
At the same time, police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news site, those arrested for terrorism are members of the same group that police arrested in July.
Those arrested are believed to have ties to the Islamic State.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their Rio basketball tournament early match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after a controlled detonation of the package.
This is the third time in the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The public was able to enter after police had controlledly detonated the package.
The audience could not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hangar.
Police blew up the package and allowed the audience into the hangar only after that.
The drink woke up the team of Spain, which started the games sleepyly.
With two losses, Spain beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the two previous games, Spain achieved silver.
Police conducted a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near a road bike finish point last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian lady beats Petäjä-Siren - Finn reflects on protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colourful day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren suffered hard on Thursday.
The Argentine lady beat Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the violation.
He got stuck due to the crash, and the others ran away, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered the protest for a long time.
It was not worth it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation,” Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was left in 27th position after the crash.
Overall, London’s 2012 Olympic silver medallist is 8th.
With regard to the tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day for the race starts 10-12.
Edited 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 Surprising Things That Scientists Say Extend Age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring more years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person has no control over can bring them more years.
These include a tendency to mid-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your life.
You don’t always have to spend money, just getting a can of milk is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a number of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest findings of the study.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with "a reduced risk of death," especially in the case of neurological or heart-related diseases.
There are studies that suggest that moderate consumption - one to three doses per day - can prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
In turn, they can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year-long project monitored over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
According to many studies, sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health.
In addition, it can also prolong your life.
Unfortunately, simply having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings more years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute flair.
A study by the University of Oxford found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to a lower mortality rate.
Whether it’s an Olympic athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he’s more likely to live longer than a regular ballerina.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring more years into his life.
Some researchers suspect that longevity, on the other hand, is due to a person's social status - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviors in people over 65 found that people who shop daily were likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may prematurely cause death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping does not have the same effect.
Drunk drunk driver crashes into truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crash occurred in Koskela, Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskila, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the passenger car that had arrived had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck remained upright in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into a ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who was carrying a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Posti sent candy to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in Salo’s K-Citymarket’s loose candy selection, because the post office had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was on Thursday buying loose candy from Salo’s K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in the bulk confectionery, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load!
If there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The lawn mowing is offered by Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update surprised me.
Even the media have been calling all the time, and the attention generated by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
He was able to get his own favorites into a bag of candy, even though a few boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti’s Corporate Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomi.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to do part delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It was first reported in the evening.
Teija Haltia was not angry with the sign, because she found all her favorite loose candy in the selection.
30 kg lighter Lotta Backlund has released a picture of her change
The comedian-producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of her life change.
On Friday, Lotta shared a couple of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and was aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her slimming contract already in 2009.
She has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and gradually lost 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of her performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund’s Before and After photo pair has collected a number of commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're amazing.
We’re on the same road, motivation!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let’s do it now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I travel on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let’s do it now project.
At the time, he told the Evening Journal that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos away.
Over the course of three months, five pounds were dropped.
The wish of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembrance of the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered a week ago in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation for police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the wishes of the victim’s family for donations to police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic remembers the woman with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money in its entirety goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Loviisa’s Koskenkylä.
The woman’s neighbors have said that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court gave Posti a conviction for violation of the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary agency worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimated in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the instructor’s salary, which corresponded to the induction’s share of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act.
The employee had complied with PAU’s organizational decision on an induction ban.
During the postal strike last November, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise temporary workers who break the strike.
It was first reported by the people.
Turkey to return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, wrote Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their reply to the Finnish Journalists’ Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Association of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of press and freedom of expression to Turkey.
Putin fired the head of his administration, replaced by Estonian-born Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
He will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Persecution Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, the Interfax news agency said.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to a Kremlin statement, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will take over special tasks related to environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB's espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU to be banned, not seen in Premier League opening
The world record player will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed with England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition of Paul Pogba is sidelined due to suspension as ManU opens his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
According to British media, ManU paid Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogballe was burdened with a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it will become a one-game suspension.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, grandioseness is a virtue
Accurate criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival performers have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in the case of production that we think this way.
Often, the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says the artistic director of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out again this year.
The goal was to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 people last year by 5,000.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
An increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle controlled by huge fairways.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been inflated over the past 13 years, with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partly decorated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, this year’s venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the company running Flow had a turnover of approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "crees" things, such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out above all through content.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in the last few years.
Thailand Tourist Paradise Bombs Hidden in Flower Pots, Tourists Flee in Horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists started to leave bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra said.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife protector who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a lot about the attacks.
If you can’t see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani, local time.
At least one died.
The number of injured is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, which was also popular with the Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by troops will go to battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are only ordered to carry out combat duties after several months after taking the military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the head of training of the Defence Forces, interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are able to fight, for example, of the 5.5-month conscripts serving in a war situation.
According to the head of training, first reservists belonging to the Standby Corps will be assigned to the service.
No conscripts or reservists are ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used in military operations already during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola gets huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, the house was exposed to a serious moisture problem that caused microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple were forced to sell the apartment as demolishable in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the couple a total of 47 344 euros in court and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already been aware of some need to repair the dwelling when the sale was made.
According to the Court of Appeal, however, the construction errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than had been proposed.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm to the aspects mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned as risks and drawbacks ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not show that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwater coming from the rock might need to be controlled a little bit within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial flora in the building, which according to witnesses were caused by both rock rainwaters and capillary rising soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, also enter indoors through the porch.
Mold or yeast above the limit values, which enabled a health risk, was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission
The court also debated whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo that the apartment had been altered in violation of the permit.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could have assumed, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a larger-than-usual inspection.
Buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children to Nazis - also Finnish in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland has recorded documents on microfilms about 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and license cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological tests were carried out on women to determine the matter.
The Finnish Race Agency investigated women’s backgrounds by studying church books, among other things.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be willing to give up their Swedish citizenship and give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The Racial Agency wanted guarantees that women were "child-lovers", "sparing", and "good National Socialists" who knew well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The article does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the United States Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidizing children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
In the sixth place of the Petty Sire, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the Finnjolls’ day in the Rio Olympics, but was the tail of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded with a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so hung over”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to bubble, and she is in a frenzy at the moment.
Mari Koppinen’s book about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Unladen, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total climb when he won the crown of the tango king at the Tango market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at his request, which Kassu Halonen adapted into a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after just a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung over!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
You wouldn’t guess from the recording of a song that became a huge hit that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn’t physically at my best, the result was still good.
I learned that you don’t always have to demand perfection and perfection.
Another incident related to the man's most popular songs, as described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his then partner and the case eventually ended up with the texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the lyrics of the song about the breakup were not true, but were written based on the news of 7 Days.
The newspaper reported that the reason for the divorce between Jari and his ex-lover was due to his excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said that it was complete nonsense and that it was not true.
According to the book, Jari was furious at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters supported the resignation and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although polls of voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the divorce, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of a recent election campaign by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into the junkyard in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economical Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the reasons economists explain the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real UK.
Many also have the impression that a decrease in the value of a currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly upset by the BBC's fairness, which gave as much room as the overwhelming majority of economists representing only a couple of percent of the economy, pro-EU withdrawal.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in saying what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capital combinations were like about the consequences of the resignation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face-to-face of economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not feel they have common interests.
The academics of big cities, such as economists, would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit vote’s overwhelming victory argument was on immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congests your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How many jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond and, if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, more detailed preparations were made for Plan B, or the victory of the camp in favour of leaving the EU, in case the result was to be left.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We started to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquid assets,” Vanhanen said of Aberdeen’s only open-ended daily-listed real estate fund.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was valued at £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is around £20 billion.
That was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds Closed Trades
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks that followed the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
Together, they raided the situation and put the issue in the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good due to the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close down trade, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be withdrawn in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite steady, and the market has been very quiet for a couple of weeks now, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no such turmoil in the continental European funds in Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen’s opinion, the closing of real estate fund trades received an unreasonably high level of attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of British real estate.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned investors this week that it might keep its funds closed until 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved down, but the situation does not look "frighter" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even created new opportunities for some real estate investors,” Vanhanen points out.
The pound/dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market before the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit has opened up the real estate market in London.
At two o’clock in the morning, things didn’t look too good.
But at four o’clock when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word, isn't it?
I realized that this is now going to Plan B,” Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive in spite of the early hours of the morning.
TV screens normally set to silent at the office were ringing the news, and normally loud crowds were completely silenced when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to report his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit Vote Starts Correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in the UK, and in particular in London.
Up to 20% minuses were anticipated for office space in London in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it is not visible on the face of Vanhanen who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is too early to say much about Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the break-up will take place and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First developments in the real estate market in London have already been reported.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
London City’s office buildings were down 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the downfall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
This is not an accurate comparison, as it is now a domestic crisis in the United Kingdom.
The mood is different.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
Funding is also available normally.
The repair could have happened anyway.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a surprise to him - one could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, property prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
The fall started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons:
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership category that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new assets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used considerably less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Disperse, decentralize
Prices increased in London last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to reduce its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not have the courage to judge the future, but says that there is hardly any rise.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady trend ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several stores up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the pits can be overcome by work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, it is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the retail group announced today that it will start collecting more detailed information about its regular customers’ purchases.
So far, when information on the total amount of the receipt has been collected, the group will start collecting it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group comes after Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the customer’s consent and is used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information,” Riitala says to Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to S Group’s registration change.
Kesko categorizes its regular customers into ten groups based on food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyal customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own customer loyalty program, which can be joined in Valintatalos, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product or product group information, we stay at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
In other words, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day as well as the total amount of the customer’s receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K Group or S Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be renewed in the future, but the Local Store will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially experiment
So far, SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address data, basic data have also included occupation, education, type of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of the children.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase contains the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash registers anyway, whether you like it or not.
Anyone interested can check their saved data on S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' newest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador’s puppy sniffs vigorously five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila with playing with his favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a jar of gunpowder-scented shells.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for e-commerce
Heila is Customs’ first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be deployed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused Customs to take measures, and after the attacks controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector General at Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs’ duties are postal items passing through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapon parts, ammunition and explosives, and their precursors, among purchases, passenger plane luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosive dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by Tulli Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and the Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs’ six drug dogs and money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can’t go home without her, she laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila from one-time.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila immediately returns the guard that looks like a soft toy from the "disengage" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, the following October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron the dog wearing work vests, Suntio points out.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60000-70000 euros per year.
They have a working life of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work takes only ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a fierce competition at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal, people get a day off
Fiji's Olympic gold medal in rugby, with a population of less than one million, is valued so high in the country that the government has decreed August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's public broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off will be the day after the team’s return home.
Heroes are also allowed to celebrate in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the final in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected for the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering,” Maikele Seru, a Fiji Times journalist, told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one really knows why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos and 145 kilos.
His total was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push of 175 kilos, as did the other.
On the third attempt, the weights increased, accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian forward Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemin Palloseura, playing in the men's football league, has signed a contract with Estonian forward Albert Prosa to the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player for our team, who has powers and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with over 10 players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is expected to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Modern Family star: teen star’s shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become the friendly Alex Dunphy of the Modern Family comedy series, reprises her brisk body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior significantly more courageously.
The star has been posing in photos posted on social media with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you can’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
At the time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He’s learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood,” Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has outraged some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard,” a woman on Winter’s Instagram said.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge to ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, exudes a young woman.
Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start the Northern Lights journeys already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in the press release.
The main destinations of Northern Lights tourism in Japan are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump card for our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for Lapland’s winter Northern Lights trips, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the northern lights season begins in early autumn and continues long into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a two-fold fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by, among other things, online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to have clearer unique sights in Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lindi.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists have increased clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as much nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting in terms of the target group of Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 as Fiji's champion team won gold
Great Britain's impressive success in a seven-player rugby race was cut short when Fiji beat it on Thursday in the final at Rio's Deodoro Stadium by 43-1.
Fiji taught the champions a lesson in ball handling, moves, side strokes, support play, running lines and brute force, thus winning gold - if the country had the first Olympic medal in its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly leaner consolation for Britain, as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first rugby-7 tournament as an Olympic sport, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win over the South African Boxes by figures in the 7-1 semi-final earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-member team had been in full strength.
It may bring comfort to the UK that at least one Briton will be necked with a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament under Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is startling.
Fiji started off excellently and showed his tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had collided with a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a crash into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal to the right side of the goal kick.
The score was 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the rocky Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but that didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, after which Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal from a follow-up start, with more than a minute left to play in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then plunged through the more powerless tackles of the Great Britain team and plunged across the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with a situation of 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentice.
Which is very true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes in the half and managed to hold the Fijians for an entire four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the Fijians' excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36-1 by scoring for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea Archipelago, whose fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s pure joyous attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan in the semi-finals by 20-20 and Great Britain had lagged past South Africa in a tight semi-final where the tie was decided by a UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South Africa Boxes lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed from under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, an English 15-player rugby team player, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row for gold
It couldn’t be more emotional in these games.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets into history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the oars, the third in the boat was echoed by the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in British sports history to reach a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undisputed, the victory was already their 39th in a row and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface of the water like swans age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the two’s achievement. However, the most important assistant is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way we think a little.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start their treatment outside the high season of the sport in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if this is the case under such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two's thoughts were on Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says, "On an emotional level, I've been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cashiers have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm to which their rivals have failed to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duo began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very close in a moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It’s very important not to get off the road.”
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything amazing.
We didn't reach for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates wedding next month with Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.”
"After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to change government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks have already called for in the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day is now scheduled for October 29.
Analysts say it’s hard to predict how much the nation’s rage last spring will affect the election results in the autumn.
In the June presidential election, the critical attitude towards those in power was clearly visible, and Gudni Johannesson, who ran for president from outside politics, was elected as president.
Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump retracted his latest rumors.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was involved in the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
“The commander-in-chief of the army should never let anyone who can sink that low,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-popular burkini bathing suits on beaches, according to the British newspaper The Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear that exuberantly express religious affiliations may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
At the end of July, two ISIS-linked men attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Pyykösjärvi
The water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been detected at Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action Board took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu Region area.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria from all bathing areas were below the action limits laid down in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal levels in the Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
Blue-algae opacity observed at Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-algae blooms, creating a blue-green algae mass on the water surface as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, this is also reported separately on the information board of the bathing area.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside Finland
The forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of a forest holding.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry’s aim is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of creating such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is a good one, says Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticism in the tax reform proposal.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the tax deduction would be more effective if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Finance starts from the premise that by reducing the pure capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss of capital income from forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can’t figure it out,” Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says, the model only applies to a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit linked to the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been too high for me.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would affect about 10 per cent of forest owners, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the boundary guarantees the goal of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken for decades in forest policy.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hail surprises motorists in Himanga, two cars fall into ditch and collide with each other
On Friday morning, there was a special accident in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the rescue services, two consecutive times the car fell into a ditch, after which the one in the back collided with the one driving ahead.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the fireman on duty is suspected to have been derailed due to strong hail.
There were two people in the car behind him, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There is no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga towards Kalajoki for a few kilometres.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turku may help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
The findings of the research group of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of a cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer medication may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in the prestigious journal Nature Communications.
Muhos' family home killing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder conviction for another perpetrator
Muhos's family home killing is continuing at the court for both convicted persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for a family home killing in Muhos.
The other was given 8 years for 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The other is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
Convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as an unauthorised young person.
The judgment of the district court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were fully understood at the time.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the couch of the living room from behind.
The director had let go of the hold and led the young man into his room, when one of the youths hit him with a vacuum cleaner pipe.
The director was also strangled by the lead, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental examination, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
The ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world and only breeds at the age of 156.
The world’s longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, an ice shark can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until the age of 156.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of mussel is known to live longer than ice sharks.
Scientists were able to determine the age by radiocarbon dating.
Nuclear testing in the 1950s resulted in radioactive residues in some sharks.
The researchers were able to estimate the age of the shark.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state's tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's proposed change to the corporate tax was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by tax relief for the benefit of the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
That would be a huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent, after Trump's proposed reduction of 33 percent.
Inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of the economy and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards decided upon in haste must be reformed and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
“Destructive” trade policy is one of the main causes of America’s problems.
Free trade agreements would be withdrawn.
China would be subject to a 45 per cent penalty tax and Mexico 35 per cent.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America Doesn't Need to Change the World:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his custom, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists — including those close to Republicans — see Trump’s program as driving the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own program early on Friday.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is tumultuous, but an actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street hustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous directorial work Journey Lovers (2013) was a hilarious and rosci-like satirical comedy, the one before Skin I live in (2011).
Levelwise, Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, interpersonal and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her grown daughter.
She begins before the birth of her daughter, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will take on the second female lead, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a lump, but I would say that it’s quite gently and literally a one-time sweep.
Almodóvar films are often characterised by such egregiousness, all the way to humor, Julieta has a fair distance.
It is an evenly played, restrained, place-to-place film with good music, and a rather sad film with elements of its elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation that is typical of a Spanish director is still there, and in such a way that it begins to sting the eye more as a pure matter of form than as a working dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true of costumes: in the case of the name person, the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same is true of spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point, i.e. the layouts of the scene in question, is not particularly improved from this.
Mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian writer Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly flatly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably more robust than the drama, that much big stuff - especially gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie premiere is 12.8.
The government is trying an election trick - Kansan Uutiset
No new cuts will be made, the ministers say, so that the Finns Party does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made in a row.
There will be no further cuts.
The $4 billion savings that have already been decided on will suffice.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (kok.) under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spending limits debate in the spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
The training cuts continue.
The town halls haunt
Why do ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts will be made to them?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallupit, however, says that the party in government expects the Finns Party to lose a rucksack, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new councillors, of which the price of influencing the right-wing government will be realised for most of them next spring.
The life span of three parties of roughly the same size depends on the courage of the Finns Party to endure.
Now it has not lasted, and more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermenting state have also surfaced.
The new “no cuts” rhetoric, firstly, blurs the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, attempts to soften the attack that awaits Finns.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set a target of indebtedness being reversed during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal will include EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not stop or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This will mean even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be pushed at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what comes next will be accepted.
These measures do not allow debt to be eliminated.
It is quite clear that the current measures do not stop the indebtedness, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget information meeting prove it irrefutablely:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal to the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy pursued at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be covered by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
The question is, do you want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities?
Three out of four feel that organising child day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also takes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, on the other hand, is most clearly sought for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for people with mental disabilities.
None of the tasks of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
A young drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol at Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop the motorbike without lights, but the young man drove the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Still after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving license that allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, for example, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
The truck in the truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the rock cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday evening at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
Rescue services lifted an injured driver out of a fallen truck through a door left above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil leaked into the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahtinkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman about 6 inches tall, slender, and well-positioned with white hair under the chin.
Observations and tips on missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre on the hotline 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge that brought down the tents of the Parafest festival caused massive damage.
The chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the market place at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The surge flow is generated in a thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools down and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surge currents will occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surge currents is difficult to predict.
The surge struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, the Parafest venue, on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air pollution obsolescences Londoners
Research has shown that Londoners age faster than usual.
The reason for the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzed London’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than that of a rural peer.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, with nearly 9,500 Londoners dying each year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel by commuting close to congested streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution with masks, for example, but regular skin cleaning is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed, pushed the man in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
When he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not run any further, as it collided with the rocks in front of it.
Riento with new powers for the coming season
League-Riento, playing in the Volleyball Championship League, will start the series in October from better starting points than in memory.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
A common note can be found with certainty better than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as being enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, a midfielder from the foreign trio, starts his second season in Rieno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who appeared on the Rwanda national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 centimetres.
Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to join the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all World Floorball Championships since 2003.
The sixth race is now taking place in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in the North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The United States was in the process of forming the National Floorball Team.
I was interested, and here I am, 48,” he said.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I arrived in Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at SM level as floorball.
The game was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later ice hockey in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship 1991-92 with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's championship, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The last season of SM is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Josban was raised by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Brno EFT tournament in the Czech Republic on 6-8 November.
The 25-year-old Perttu Puska has previously played six men’s national games in Helsinki, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the leg trouble and is a member of the national team's regular fleet with experience of 117 international games.
Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at last December's World Cup, was also named to the national team.
The head coach of the floorball team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volleyball’s Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the Finnish Championship Finals tournament will qualify for the top six pairs of each series ranking.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been one of the top Finnish beach volleyball champions for several years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to watch this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena at the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s spark in the sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
I have very good memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old with Elimäki YMCA E-girls.
At the top is a shirt that is too big, knee pads that rotate around the ankles, as well as huge ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment in which to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the activities - our teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural sport choice in junior times to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
Bites have been played on the beach of Curved Pond since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to see the Junior Championships myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu and Anniina Parkkinen play together in the Finnish Championship Finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey we are still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend’s performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges in civil work are expected.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The surge brought down three tents at the Parafest festival for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to the hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred on Friday at 5 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, an on-call fire officer interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli becomes a farmer
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers based on his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking in debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into hand from agriculture.
Ever since I was a kid, this has been my thing.
I’ve always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you start something, you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I took part in the project with great courage, and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out well.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer Competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
You can vote for him on the newspaper’s website until August 21st.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2%.
The annual average inflation measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
Compared with June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 percent compared to December 2015 percent) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, there was an increase in the prices of the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.2%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says that the filter in question was inspired by an anime, but some observers think it is racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, approximately 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lentils are unembellished, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favouring blackface or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users a filter this week that turned their eyes slanted, distorted their teeth and made their cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts suggest a larger problem the company has with the difference.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written by e.g. the online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced that it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the images were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing".
He adds: "It's hard to deny the likeness of a very tasteless Asian caricature to filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
There seems to be an endless struggle in American culture for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s general audience is made up of young people with more diverse ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect discretion even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things no longer go unnoticed very easily, as they did in the past," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer for the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In an article published in Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnicity-related conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's executives, mostly white and men only, and concluded their writing with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions like this, or that they also have colored people as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but according to its spokesperson, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this isn't OK."
Congressional expert group says military officials misrepresented intelligence on ISIS
On Thursday, a group of congressional experts released a report that officials from the Central Command, the U.S. armed forces, changed the intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war on ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what the events on the ground suggested.
The Republican Chairs of the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defense Appropriations set up a task force to conduct an interim report on the "public dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts. Analysts say that senior military officials embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, abbreviated Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed and were invariably more positive than those of other intelligence community services," the report said in a press release.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable — our soldiers suffer when high-level policymakers are presented with false analyses," said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"Centcom management errors extend to top level of organization".
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that occurred in 2014 and 2015 with Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by Obama administration officials have been forged, it does provide an image of analysts suggesting that Centcom leaders had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," the report says.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military assault to retake Mosul could occur as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence leaders in the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq".
The Republicans set up a task force after learning of the suspicions raised by analysts that intelligence concerning ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, which was released on Thursday, will follow with more accurate results, as investigations are still ongoing.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of Defense has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence information.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, senior Democrat on the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence results, "violated the morale of analysts" and "insufficient attention to dissenting views".
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "a pre-determined or political official line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of lawsuits by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesperson, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that, "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an allegation made by an increasing number of defence officials).
However, the allegations made last year called into question how much President Obama can trust Central Command and that it gives honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of ISIS intelligence matches the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that President George W. Bush's government, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only small forces in Iraq and spent little time reflecting on what the 2003 invasion would entail.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence on ISIS.
According to officials, last year the Hooker Task Force concluded that despite opposing public statements, airstrikes at ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the investigation were not passed on outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after many legislators had judged the testimony given to the Senate to be too positive reviews of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, commander of Central Command.
U.S. wins fourth duel in women's field hockey and establishes position in showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in the winning, goal-by-goal 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States beat India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keeps track of the goals they score."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share first place with Britain in their group, which continued their winning streak as they beat Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Each team made it to the final, which determines which of them will be ranked first in the group of six teams and which will be second.
The first-placer avoids a longer-term encounter with the Dutch team considered tough, who won the second group.
No matter how Saturday's game goes, the Americans have already raised the issue of their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first grabbed a field hockey bat at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel). He entered the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest ever national team player.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he did not make it to the final list of players.
This was followed by the 2012 Games, which saw little success from him and his team.
The following year, English coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not as it is now.
We've made a complete turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball from close with a backhand in.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, swung into the midfield, hit the ball to the finish and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, one hit was scored in each of the Americans.
Briggs is now in his season of success,
Just like Bam.
"Our ranking is good now," says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympics, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the location and time, the Olympics are inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to follow as a heated message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton, passing from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast, and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can’t turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a café queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a guy named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-timer of the Olympics, is charmed by his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best time to watch and listen, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good-natured TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Away from the center, partly in the shade are the lesser known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest article about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never won medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side, the medals have been grabbed by Canadians.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog, partly because for an uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for an Olympics.
(I am not an expert, just a fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoon films in the characters' endlessly constant bounce scenes. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jumps, i.e. sports that combine in a trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "a springboard".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline that ejects them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers need to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, the jumps are judged on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common course of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medal hopes must get further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to a goal line or starting wall, they also have another goal they pursue in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to bring the onlooker to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just watching the games.
This trampoline provides a respite.
In the trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down, and flings back up effortlessly.
Of course, the sport also has a competitive aspect, and it’s not easy either, but it doesn’t involve a frenzied rush to the finish line or jumping far, just a dreamy and fluid combination of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen as only the Olympic competition can get.
The women's qualifying matches and finals take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1:00 p.m. local time and the men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 14:00 local time each day.
In the midst of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of the general hustle and bustle.
And if awareness can only be raised by providing appealing male athletes and objectifying them — as recently suggested by U.S. male gymnasts according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed demonstrations across Ethiopia that demand political change.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to ever larger areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a radical political change.
Human rights groups said the government’s response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Video footage of the demonstrations, supposedly at the end of last year or early this year, shows security forces hitting young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group at the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence support the Ethiopians closely in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, with few African countries, if any, receiving this much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, with the capital Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model country for democracy: human rights organisations have constantly reported on the government's repressive policies, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly muted.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to demonstrate, it will burst out," says Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
“The whole community is demonstrating.
A whole generation protested.”
There are many reasons for dissatisfaction, from land use to government coalition strangulation of power.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously held by the opposition, and as a result they now control the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing on the Eritrean border, where the escalated situation claimed hundreds of lives in the fighting in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the mayhem and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been smoldering beneath the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and access to the internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, however, many have access to the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to the demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharics.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharic people, mainly from the Christian Highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited Oromos, a large part of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
"The collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said he was particularly adept at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors to mediate between the opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces administered by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first screwed up and then stole.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though fewer died than in the preceding months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not stopped the strengthening.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amharic city of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighbouring Somalia, but the US says the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires a tight balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in the latest controversy he faced in his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions for the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters will also find themselves in an awkward situation, who will have to try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election ceremony on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
On Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump tweeted about the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The latest storm of criticism rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton delivered their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to come back to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to urge Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He watches how supporters react to messages, and then “clarify” in one way or another depending on the reactions,” says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they are circular enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to election audiences, Trump has changed his style in recent days to even more pungent as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is tightly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or of not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the final months of his presidential campaign, having been the subject of increasing scrutiny, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, defended the presidential candidate vigorously in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be justified, political speech," replied Giuliani, when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called a 'lower-range team' and that's why this happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its actions when it failed to deal with the situation decisively in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of strutting his speeches and discriminatory attitude toward him.
He mocked "ungood and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they can't do it.
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's explanation, saying it only showed more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Due to an unfair rent increase, the closed cafe opens in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a slightly raggedy café in Williamsburg, where cash was only accepted and there was no Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was priced out of its streetside seat on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
The locals find this loss of the café, which has been put out of the middle class, to be regrettable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB club no longer exists, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and the Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is no longer what it used to be, it is also a place where new things are created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unsophisticated.
The coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at the Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches and capers and browned onion rings for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
The café no longer serves beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruit.
After keeping the cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers began to visit the Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers also had to be priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly attended the Verb.
After still moving to Greenpoint, he made walks to the Verb then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took instead of his usual iced coffee a chai tea blend, which is also a new item on the list.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work, and without exception, he ordered the same thing.
“I walked into a coffee shop every day after quarter of seven, like a machine, and there they were already making my voibagel with all the stuffing,” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of the Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verbi's own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee from the café.
The café may also expand to the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home,” Whitt says.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The Dreadful Food of the Great Depression in a New Work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office at the White House.
Known as a culinary artist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, is about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, titled 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new co-author is the Harper-published and Tuesday-published A Square Meal, which depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreeing to meet with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the major stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich, while 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was well suited for a discussion about eating the Great Depression.
"The sorrows were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf, and bean loaf.
They were made from materials that were cheap and rich.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe grins.
"It must have weighed on the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you like".
The women made food for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new inexpensive diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as crumbs and casseroles became the main food, and casseroles were called "a great way to exploit food residues" because chefs could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been at the heart of an American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, in which the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even sound kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage-time dish.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion don't go together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget-keepers and to meet the challenge of turning carrot-cream pages into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowan farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and the sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-covered dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the dishes served at the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but the most poorly prepared."
Many of the depression food was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
As the couple wrote the book, they began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," says Coe.
"People even began to get sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once for wind hats".
After the main dishes were emptied at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they made at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly submerged our spoons in thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe gave it a second time and a third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Gilead receives full compensation for attorneys’ fees for patent dispute over hepatitis C drug with Merck
A U.S. Regional Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for attorneys’ fees for a dispute over the patent for the hepatitis C drug with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was acquitted in June of $200 million in damages for violating two Merck-owned patents in connection with Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni success drugs. A U.S. judge found Merck guilty of violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a lawsuit registered Thursday, U.S. Regional Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to an exemption from attorney’s fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed private ownership of sofosbuvir, which is under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed troops have seized the city of Manbij from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have seized control of the city of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, after the last ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) faction is now canvassing the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
A spokesman for the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"We now have full control of the city, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Secretary of State, announced that she had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book dealing with her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10 years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a model for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and retracts his promises to release his tax records.
US presidential candidates have always disclosed their tax records, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the IRS for an audit, saying it is the reason why Trump has not released his income records.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams referring to the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Legal Counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax records until the inspections are complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose the information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this issue and posted a video online Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in an economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades and does not publicize his tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no or little taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has advocated a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway multi-subsidization headquarters is located at the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffett says he has also been subject to an IRS audit and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the town of Chappaqua, New York, paid an actual federal tax of an average of 32% between 2007 and 2014, and the actual compound tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was on salary earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a total of $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powdered firecracker condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements —the elephants are being harassed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The initiative has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has, together with the US-based Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as now villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed by pointing a flashlight and ringing the horn.
If this doesn’t work, throw in the so-called chili cloud.
The ground mixed chili powder is placed in the condom together with the firecracker, after which the end of the condom is twisted closed so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spice is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is a thrower that shoots a fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab "call" — RT News
A French film director with Jewish roots gave rise to a media rage after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention the area code of Israel in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
“How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel is completely exterminated — as if it didn’t exist?”
Lanzmann is writing.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the Kempinski hotel management".
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are calling for the removal of Israel's area code."
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the incident a "great disgrace".
"The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and it is this very hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of alleged Arab customers.
"Shame on you" was said in a publication highlighting the hotel's location near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never issued," writes a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets in demonstration of Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
Riots began when law enforcement authorities attempted to disperse a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by hundreds of students who wanted to express their dismay at the government's plans.
Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the state of Sao Paulo, has proposed a austerity measure that closes nearly 100 public schools and places 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed President Michel Temer.
The student demonstration took place just days after the streets were filled with protesters supporting the expelled President Dilma Rousseff, with the country's Senate voting on impeachment for this.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the lifting of the sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
He said Russian companies' interest in doing business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further growth in trade is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by sales of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, Russia's foreign mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
For the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to visit Russia.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner raced to the finish line as the British won cycling gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland gained fame in the men's team sprint at Rio's velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the title earned in London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner was in the role of anchor, which he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland. The youngster made the legend proud as he ran to the finish line and captured the victory from the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships held in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replacing Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first lead.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the racing career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man that the British coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the title with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand was faster in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny struggled to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the speed with a larger gear, which allowed Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed from his seat as a BBC commentator and reached the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I’m just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There’s no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to having fallen to the track on purpose due to a poor start.
He later retracted his words, and the British rivals had no means of appeal.
This time there were no problems of this kind associated with sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, then a successful five-day velodrome is ahead.
As Kenny has shown by his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean an account accumulation with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next to compete in a sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
Kenny, 28, of Bolton, says, "At the moment I can only rejoice at this.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the win with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the finals (at 22:42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the competition editors yesterday before the time trial when the officials invited him to measure his length.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now count on its mighty track cycling team to take over the mid-Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the ending of racing careers for major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night at the velodrome show that the UK’s already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment will once again be realized.
The future of the Portland smelter is at stake as a result of the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company supplying the smelter told it that one of the plant's owners is cancelling the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to continue the subsidies to keep the factory running.
The fixed aid, which has been granted for 20 years, will expire in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing 2,000 jobs.
As many as 2000 direct or indirect jobs could be at risk as a result of the closures.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa Portland smelter is losing money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to speculations about the future of the plant for years, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of the factory's production.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other smelter owners will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina, with Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, meaning that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
The AGL states that the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contract notice period is 12 months, so it will expire in 2017.
“Consequently, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue for fiscal year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential impact on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL says it has already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million as "anticipating the termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... capabilities to keep the smelter in operation or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The US firm said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still has to find out why it has now withdrawn from the deal.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelter in Victoria, Portland, and the Tomas plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL's chief operating officer, told analysts earlier in the week that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If these plants leave the market, it will mean a significant decrease in demand (electricity) in the market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality TV star Kendall as September Vogue cover girl
A model from the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the US Vogue's famous September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the cover in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just following the style of the Kardashians series?), a scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten his sister's cover. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichéd, and is used in almost every birthday episode of the asten shows (Seacrest pronounces the words, "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in some way into this publicity.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue undoubtedly marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on Vogue's cover along with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release of the year.
A number more like a large picture book in thickness than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (fashion website Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The release of the cover star of the September issue is so eagerly awaited that in the previous two years the magazine’s images have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover models for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models who are celebrities.
Oscar-winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for her generation, and even if she’d rather be among the celebrities who work as a model, she’s still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry above all others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career, when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner’s success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have flared up again as news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover came out.
However, the constant feeling of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
She walks into Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
She is the advertising face of Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries are being turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact of further budget cuts on centres already operating at extreme borders.
In the state of Queensland, three people who apply for free legal aid and legal services are already turned away from five people — most of whom are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without the need for resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further budget cuts.
As of June of next year, legal aid centers are in danger of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland's Public Legal Aid Center, reports that thousands of people are already being turned away each year, according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centers.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away as they seek the essential services they need," says Farrell.
"People leaving violent relationships, people under an uncontrolled and crippling burden of debt, divorced families, unwarranted dismissals — all of them have legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, meaning that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was supposedly taken after its management was told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving a Jeep in February.
The event is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte by former state campaign software trainer Vincent Bordini.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized, in his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign director Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed a barrel into Vincent's kneecap".
According to the lawsuit, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini said in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused public outrage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of the Second Amendment" — which are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign staff said the media removed his words from context and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
In his lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for indifferent leadership and Phillip for assault, assault, and the emotional suffering they cause.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking for a comment.
Phillip, despite his efforts, was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to a call request submitted to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow, too, is reviving the economy and creating prosperity — not only in local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the point of greatest interest in Heathrow, and, as at the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to ensure that all our nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who feel that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to increase the economy by £211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, which included the T5 terminal — voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years — and the T2 terminal, built in the middle of two of the world’s most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway supported by a £16 billion private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that there will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
Companies that make money from online advertising to mislead ad blocker software have turned into a cat-mouse game, says one company that produces blocker programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad-blocking programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post stating that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block social ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad tag code on its desktop site so that it will be more difficult for ad-blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now, Adblock has revealed the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of bludgeoning between the open source ad blocker community and diversionaries has been going on since ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own fix again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide use ad-blocking software, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, the number has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad blockers in its desktop app, as the spokesperson says that mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it is updating its user preferences ad tool so users can have more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also prevent some regular Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
“Advertising programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that’s why we’ve instead invested in developing user settings like adware tools so people can control the targeting of ads themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by being hit by cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of witnesses on the highway in the first hours of Thursday after a woman was deliberately hit by several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman committed a desperate act by laying down on a dark road and was hit by several cars, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and she was clearly trying to commit suicide, including a truck.
A woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified. The police ask them or other witnesses to the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That will be left to the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where drivers are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person was walking on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges of manslaughter against him after he collided with a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk heavily and passed out on the road.
The court held that the driving style of the police — who were responding to the distress call — was justified and the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Has Been Viable
According to estimates from NASA's new climate model, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was intended to determine whether conditions on Venus may have sometimes been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on its surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous scientists, the slow rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth, and yet it has rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had more arid areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
"In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its day-side is towards the sun for almost two months at a time," said Anthony Del Genio, a researcher at GISS.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
With hydrogen karate, all that remained in space was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect —that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from his position as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and deputy director of hockey operations for the club, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately begin seeking a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and deputy director of ice hockey with vigor, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
“During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice president of the club's hockey activities must be in exactly the same line as the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of the Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made a further season in the past two years.
The Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the 2015-2016 season and was five points away from the Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goaltender Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks and halt strike
The chief negotiators report that wage strikes by North Sea oil workers will be interrupted as all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, an oilfield service provider, has been faced with strikes on drilling rigs in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute".
As of the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks to address the issues of fresh aspects.
Trade unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its North Sea contractors’ tariffs by approximately 9% this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the country in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the leeway necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, with a view to making its operations more efficient after its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in an entire generation in the North Sea.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few," says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian cluster to date.
Based on the new data, astronomers will be able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times are related to a planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the star’s weight and age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching adulthood.
They are currently spinning faster than ever.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of stellar wind are released from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they advance through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between recognizable starspots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggest that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — larger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see Pleiades' 'dancing' that slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars in relation to the speeds of rotation.
“The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars,” says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
