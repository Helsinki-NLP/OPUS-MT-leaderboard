A 9-year-old boy found in Texas
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy’s escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life and health.
The boy’s father told Ilta-Sanom about midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start looking into the afterlife.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in the game, and he's pulling a goal difference to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and continued to work in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned, at least for a moment, to the benefit of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid alone moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer record when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetski into the net with two hits from penalty kicks and one from a playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A in the early part of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League it started strongly with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-wrecking Sergei Aguero.
In the weekend major league game, injured Aguero did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also went through a tough time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old linebacker Luke Shaw's away game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the target at the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely fractured the tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of scoring in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
Argentinean Angel Di Maria changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG hat.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland in the back corner.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is one of the most successful of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the minor clubs in the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG's star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow CsSKA lost in a Group B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for the resignation, the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe resign because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had taken place solely at Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech dealt with the impact of China's economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria call for extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders for the refugee crisis next week.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of interior ministers.
In an emergency call, the professor admits that he shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice slightly shaking the police at her home and said she had shot her girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor said that the contact details of the family of the deceased woman would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on white paper: "I am very sorry and wish I could undo my actions. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the letter signed by Lamb read, according to authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 miles to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history considered dead at the door of his office on campus, who is believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford stated that the university's authority was informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
There was one more death on the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind securely locked doors, and authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive.
The researchers examined the details in both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb told about the man. The researchers created a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
Gautier police at the place where Prentiss died said the professor had no prior history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in his book, which had given recognition to "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to spend an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a teaching staff of 17. Many of the students participated in courses for both men.
However, there were indications of problems.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said the professor seemed excited and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year, she taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that a dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
University Rector William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that there was clearly something bothering Lamb.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police determined which route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile and a half from his parents' home, Methel Johnson, a Washington County coroner, said.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson told them that he believed that the man knew the residents of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a teacher of geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had a population of 12,000 in 2009 .
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest-serving friends described this as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls were in love with her," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but no documents indicate that they have not been married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and lived in a brick house in a river estuary in the small town of Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told us that he broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was absolutely shocked," O'Steen said of his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica for a sparse audience.
There was nothing to suggest that something was wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
“We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor.”
"Professor Schmidt, who was saddened, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," Professor Don Allan Mitchell said.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
On the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a memorial service under candlelight, with teaching staff, other staff, students, and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nightly event where the college choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
“The crisis is over.
This is a healing day.”
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana, New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as police now say that Lamb made a 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further clarified that while Lamb referred to Prentiss in an emergency call as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not plan to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products says it will offer its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, employing 45,000 seasonal workers in 2014.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month, and new employees will start between October and December.
Although there are still months to go into the holiday season, the high season in the trading sector is fast approaching, and companies are preparing for hiring temporary labor in stores, as well as shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox makes a joke about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox’s career.
The opening night also had personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty seat next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told the trailer for the documentary Back in Time.
"When the movie started, I realized it was a lot like a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary is related to the Back to the Future films, and the documentary interviews not only Fox, but also Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely the time travel film of all time for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD formats and will air in selected cinemas starting in October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there was no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that the weapons would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place in conjunction with the UN General Assembly ministerial week to be held later this month.
Mr Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers had created a situation that was impossible to resolve.
Ban called on five permanent member states to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the crisis in Syria that achieved the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Responses to “Is Donald Trump Serious?”
Trump has been tried to be an idler.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict Trump’s collapse.
In Republican circles, every effort has been made (so far) unsuccessfully to pull Trump out of the polls.
Ten out of eleven national polls are showing Donald Trump double-digit ratings, some already seriously considering what it says in practice about the real estate mogul's candidacy prospects.
The elections are still at an early stage.
No one has announced that Trump will be nominated as a Republican.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was at the poll top at this time in 2011, was allowed to give way to rising Herman Cain. Neither ultimately won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would have a hard time in a general election.
External factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and are beginning to dig up the gum to bring him down.
The following recent polls show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a shrug:
There has been a reversal in Trump’s support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University poll, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About 3 out of 10 are negative.
These figures also hold in states where elections are held first.
At the Quinnipiac poll last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be happy with Trump's nomination.
In a CNN and ORC poll last week, 67% of Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's potential election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump’s nomination.
Ben Carson is getting almost as enthusiastically received as Trump (43 percent would be very happy with Carson's nomination and 40 percent would be happy with Trump's nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
In third place is Marco Rubio, with 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very unhappy if Jeb Bush was elected as the party's candidate.
Most Republicans don’t find Trump’s temperament problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and offensive comments. 52 percent of Republican supporters nationwide consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be appropriate for the president. The views are shown in an opinion poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the convention will be the first to take place: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be appropriate for the Chief of Defense.
However, according to the ABC and Post poll, 44 percent believe Trump is unable to function effectively on the mission, and six out of ten think Trump's temperament is inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They are starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as the party's nominee, according to the CNN and ORC poll, 4 out of 10 believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry the likely candidate, and only 28 percent Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans support the other candidate, Trump beats almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the split camp is likely to benefit Trump, as Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in a fictitious duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always have a larger crowd of support on his side.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz the only real opponent of Trump?
Ben Carson would win over Trump by 19 points in a fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump supporters say they have already made a vote.
According to a poll released Tuesday by CBS and NYT, more than half of Trump supporters are confident of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his or her mind.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump’s biggest rival at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already selected their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will banish important Hispanic voters from Republican forces and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the ABC News and Washington Post polls released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently garner about half of the Republican vote in total. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders.
The Republicans want to have a fresh face as a candidate instead of a political veteran. According to the latest opinion poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
According to an opinion poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% are on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to face up for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and the media and Labour will be following him hard.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn will be put to the parliamentary test following the formation of a shadow government and a speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Trade Union Confederation (TUC) on Tuesday.
The Labour leader's decision to remain silent at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held during the national anthem on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory party representatives, who have also made headlines on the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's representative stated that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, respecting the silence of the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he had urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his anti-monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's election to party leadership.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements over UK membership of the EU and the conditions for granting benefits tightened by the government have piled up in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told a TUC meeting that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the shadow government's Labor and Pensions Secretary Smith stated that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to lower the limit from 26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces over the past decade as leader of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a new approach to the policy, says he has chosen the questions to be asked by Cameron from his 30,000 proposals received from the public.
According to Corbyn, who was elected from the constituency of Islington North, Question Time has too many clashes, and he promises to avoid witty wording and dirt-throwing and says instead he will focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Secretary Angela Eagle is filling in for her in question classes, for example when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown into the air the idea that others might sometimes be able to make their voices heard, saying that he had discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
Following Corbyn's rise to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-like policy that is often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted failure in his effort.
Ever since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key indicator of a leader's judgment, control of the House of Commons, and status, but critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless youth to photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A group of former street children have found a meaningful way to learn and earn.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit filming studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home territory and earn money at the same time.
BBC News met a youngster who has graduated through the project among the first.

Pounds gain strength as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
Between May and July, wages in the UK increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
Growth was the fastest than forecast since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1% and was quoted at $1,5505. The pound also strengthened against the euro, and was quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49% to 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, which experienced a 20% increase in the price when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
If completed, the deal would combine the two largest brewing companies in the world and bring under one roof brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose 0.9 percent in the wake of the positive results of the rival Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. Sales development was also driven by growth in Burberry’s key markets in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant announced its intention to raise $2.5 billion in a share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mond's shares were the biggest downer with a 4.3 percent drop as Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
JD Sports's price rose 3.1 percent after the sports company announced that its pre-tax return would rise 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage spending could hamper expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Management Team, said that raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the company’s higher labour costs.
According to Cowgill, rising labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional workforce.
Metcash Launches Grassroot Campaign Against Aldi’s Fall
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA store from the invasion of Ald in southern and western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain IGA retail market share in southern and western Australia against Aldi's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing on mainstream media and social media, as well as organizing events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastings at IGA stores, and retailers sell tickets to South Australian Football League games to regulars at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to release more detailed information on its defense strategy on September 29, when the Food, Alcohol and Hardware Wholesale will hold its annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, with South and Western Australia making up nearly 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint, and these areas have a higher margin yield than the IGA store network in the eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their parochial nature and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, while in the Eastern Länder it is only 14%.
Morgan Stanley analysts, for example, believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA merchants could sell 360 million and Metcash could sell a $250 million notch by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in sales in these areas.
Metcash’s fixed costs are high, so a loss of food sales and volume could mean a $13 million loss in earnings before interest and taxes.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, with a market share that would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, chief portfolio manager for Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that it is highly likely that Metcash will disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public stand on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped since 2010 from 18% to 14%, and Metcash’s food business, which serves 1,200 IGA retailers, has decreased by 43 percent from the 2012 level, showing a decrease in debt financing due to pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than $150 million to meet Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products each week. The chain wants to support retailers in renovating stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh produce and improve the range of food products in the store's own brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price revision and store renewal plans are well underway, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves special mention for his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a bystander in a recent incident involving Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party of the duo named "Special K" Kokkinakis came into an unfavorable spotlight when bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to twice separate the rivals. "Wawrinka should have beaten the Kyrgiosis and my guy," Harrison stated.
At the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis struck the bat field in frustration when strong cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
Currently, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for single-game second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been drawn into the controversy," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the game at the U.S. Open. He is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he has done.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behavior in the US Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to age 19, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players and is respected among the players. He trains hard, is in good shape and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios Australia from the important round starting on Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra's breed as a long-term reinforcement of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches instead of the polemic related to Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, for example, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves to be criticized for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions. We also try to make peace for him. I believe that it is best for both the team and Nick.”
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and arrested illegal immigrants to prevent the flow of migrants.
Chaos was created on the border as hundreds of migrants flocked to a no-man's-land, and the Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the road between country checkpoints in their tents indefinitely
Frustration began to surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some went on a food and drink strike in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it would not allow migrants to be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will need to be discussed in Brussels in the next few days and also in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
A day later, a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed that the responsibility for the 40 000 influxes of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is shared, and the hope arose that agreement could be reached by next month or the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday to discuss the migrant crisis on the continent.
Hungary did not, however, put its hope in urgent action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to introduce more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up legal processes in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to block the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence is already in place at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the bidding process for the finishing of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that the majority of the people arriving are standard of living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek refuge.
According to the new law, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-meter high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis in the country," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: Illegal border crossing is a crime".
In practice, the military action that is expected next week is still to be approved by Parliament; journalists from the Associated Press news agency at the border have been seeing heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said officials had captured 45 border crossings at the border and 15 further away.
By injuring the fence, people who have crossed the border are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday.
Chaos took over the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a point of contact in a small metal container, where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary, with people declaring they were on a food and drink strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead against Bernie Sanders contracted by half according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's approval rate is still double-digit in the race for the Democratic national presidential nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has yet to announce his possible departure for the presidential race, with 15 percent support among Democrats.
More than five months before the primary election, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their election than those of other candidates.
Since the poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a solid leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly, with only a 5% forward over Sanders.
Clinton has lost her lead among Democrats under the age of 50, and is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage over older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over the Sanders, but Sanders has now taken a five-point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if she was elected as the party's candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with minor reservations, and 15% would support her only because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would be particularly avid supporters even if she was elected as a candidate.
There is more dissension among those who do not currently support Clinton; only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
48% of Democratic voters support Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the position (10%).
Clinton's supporters also cite his association with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice President is still weighing his potential nomination, and 57% of Democratic voters would like him to enter the race, while a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate for the party's nomination, the majority chooses Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over the Sanders, with Sanders with a head start of 20 percentage points, and that'll increase to 30 percent if Sanders doesn't go.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual election, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden’s chances of winning the election.
However, Democratic voters consider views on factual issues to be more important than candidates' chances of winning.
Voters do not find Democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in terms of characteristics.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often regarded as the type of leader.
As many as 30% of Democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, while 15% of Sanders does not know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden's views as close to voters' own ideology.
For all features, about a quarter do not have an opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked about the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and it has not changed their perception of Clinton.
Americans generally disagree.
Half of Americans are unhappy with the Clinton report, and only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
A majority of Americans feel that their overall image of Clinton has not been affected by the controversial use of email. 36 percent say the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, 6 out of 10 are Republicans.
While voters in their own party think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these qualities when asked about the views of all voters: Clinton is only considered honest and trustworthy by 32 percent, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy either.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates involved in the poll, Biden, Carson, and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, and the margin of error in the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Reaches Donald Trump's Lead in National Support Poll
According to the latest poll by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has achieved Donald Trump.
The two candidates grabbed more than half of the vote in a new poll, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters across the country, Trump still has solid support. The support rate has risen from 23% in the CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month. According to a poll released on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support for the project went up dramatically over the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support in all populations, and in a group of college graduates, he narrowly beats Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support being the weakest and has dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% one way or the other.
According to the latest CNN and ORC poll published last week, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, while Trump's support is 32 percent.
Also in the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In a meeting with the men last week, Trump fired false accusations at a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Five members charged with death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student at a school ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people are charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Ps fraternity of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013. According to police, Deng was not delivered by the fraternity in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
Authorities said the victim's eyes were blindfolded, a backpack filled with almost 15 pounds of sand was placed on his back, and he had been repeatedly attacked as he attempted to reach a target placed across an icy field.
Deng reportedly first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
Police say members of Pi Delta Ps County did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Police chief Chris Wabner told a press conference that members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact the council president Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the tools, putting the benefit of the college ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner stated.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy record, Deng had been struck several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the hazing of the school, as at least one student a year has died as a result of hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The members of the Union and its members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County presented five members of the county to be charged with third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members are charged with hazing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to take responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organization that officially or informally approved the hazing," Wagner told a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the county from operating, and the national fraternity resigned from the activities of the local department.
How the Federal Reserve’s (Fedin) Interest Rate Increases Affect
The rise in interest rates and the boom in the stock market falter, the return on securities rises and the economy slides into recession.
We know that.
We don’t know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In the economics sector, in particular, we can find an indication of the timing in history.
The recession has arrived in up to 11 months since the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, although not always; the decisive factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why central bank officials have already been under intense stress about investors not paying attention to when the interest rate increase starts, but to how long it will take to normalize the situation.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
In the end, however, market participants may find that any fuss associated with raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of a central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Chief Global Economist at Capital Economics, told his clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect interest rates to gradually normalise to a rather low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Based on historical trends, here are examples of how impacts can be reflected in different sectors of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the prospect of raising interest rates can increase instability for a while.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be a stagnation in interest returns on capital after the first drawdown for 12 to 24 months, perhaps again reflecting a delay in monetary policy," a Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of the rise in interest rates.
More specifically, over a period of 35 years, the market usually sees a sharp rise in interest rates at the time of the rise, about 14 percent, fairly steady for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), after 500 days, the situation normalizes, and the average interest rate return after six stock cycles is 14.4 percent, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares tends to increase slightly later in the cycle and interest income begins to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but rising interest rates usually do the trick.
In this case, if the central bank is faced with circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate a downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank’s key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 key interest rates raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value has been below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6%, many did not think it would last, and the third quarter is at 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Regional Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and one can ask whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
In the market, operators have been talking about raising the interest rate throughout the year, and the eyes turn to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if an open market committee approves a raise at this meeting, futures trading shows only a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all withdrawal cycles up to this day have been in a supercycle, where GDP that is also falling before the downturn is rising very rapidly since the boom began," the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is by far the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already the 74th month.
Fixed-yield securities have also been volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect is faster on bonds than on stocks when the central bank changes the price.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change immediately when the first rise/fall cycle begins.
At the end of the rise cycle, returns will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates causes long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and the curve to level out.
"High-yield bonds often fare better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, a firm-yield securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change of direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the appreciation of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," Jones said.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk margins have widened and volatility has increased. All are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly in the US market benefit because interest rates fall and local products begin to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the strengthening dollar causes their products to become more expensive in global markets and higher debt.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more profitable over the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts told their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet outperformed companies with a weak balance sheet after interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and shares with low volatility also performed better in terms of quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
“The debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects will be visible.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being too popular.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to distinguish from its commercial rival.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards only as a copy of the Brits Awards.
Housewoman Damien Collins has accused The Voice of being impersonal.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of Classic FM. Accusations put pressure on the station to prove that they offer more than just commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and the channel is not much different from its commercial rival.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be moving in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, held for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, we are simply mimicking what is already on the market,” Bingham says.
The BBC's director-general denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3's offering has significantly more live music and educational content than its commercial rival.
"From Radio 3, I learned something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey stated that the station needs to work harder to keep the public interested, as the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel to have been criticized for entering hard commercial channel territory, at the hearing of a limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice talent search competition, which was bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media, for an estimated £22 million.
"The program is hardly discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 show, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced in a manner typical of the BBC.
In addition, Collins insisted that the company search for a hit show in its own stable when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to rule out the continued subscription of The Voice or the use of taxpayers' money for other entertainment formats.
E-commerce growth slowest ever in August, probably due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
E-commerce sales have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
E-commerce strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November can curb the appetite for purchases.
For more than a decade, e-commerce has deserted many of Britain’s shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilizing, and the new sales figures show an increase of only 7% during the first three months of 2015.
In August, total sales growth was slowest in the whole period when online sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilizing, and the new sales figures show an increase of only 7% during the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth with 2000 figures, it's clear that growth will stabilize over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor-in-chief at IMRG, told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
"As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and for many it was possible to buy in a different environment, for example from a sofa at home.
As mobile shopping is now more moderate, growth can level off."
Black Friday, which originates in America, is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the theme day celebrated on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times as many online shoppers as normal caused many merchants’ websites to crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd in after offers, can curb the desire to buy at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a pound for every £5 was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
Mecca to bury victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden family held responsible
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia said the construction company Saudi Binladin Group was responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane that fell on the Grand Mosque of Mecca
A crowd of white-dressed people had gathered in the streets to bid farewell to the victims on their final journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning convoy passed at the pilgrimage site, where a collapsed building crane had only a day earlier penetrated through the mosque's roof on top of the Muslims.
Saudi Arabia's king has called on the family business of Bin Laden to be held responsible for the accident, which injured an additional 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims who died in a crane accident at the Grand Mosque of Mecca were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had travelled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were beginning their annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have promised that a hajj pilgrimage will take place as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not in use.
According to a press release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly to blame for the accident.
The English language service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the management of the Group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a press release on crane failure, and no representatives of the Group have been reached for an opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and of cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of the giant Binladin Group construction project.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi royal family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
A crane accident in heavy rain and high winds occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in a lifetime.
Officials say 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered the payment of 1 million rials (about 250,000 euros) to the relatives and permanent disabled persons of the victims.
Other injured persons will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says the phenomenon is caused by cheap Eastern European labour force
The British are hiring home handymen more often, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been boosted by skilled, professional workers from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be transferring home hammering and painting jobs to workers from Eastern Europe.
Nowadays, hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce.
Today, the British are increasingly hiring handymen to take care of the household chores, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home refurbishment stores. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher is planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labor in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, population trends need to be taken into account, as more and more women living alone are now also renovating their homes.
“The staff at our stores are still mostly men,” Laury says.
“We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are at the helm of the British FTSE 100, and has also reorganized the management team so that there are equal numbers of male and female leaders.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with exactly 50 per cent of its staff made up of women, including CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the leadership team."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are declining, even though the company worked hard after the closures of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other central employees’ organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad demonstration by the workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when things are going bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been set up.
More than 50,000 people online have already announced that they are not going to participate in the demonstration and are going to work.
In the good old days, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but to openly declare a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members is not much of a moment, but it is something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement’s operations, the government’s violent solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
Since things have seemed to be rolling on their own for years, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers’ rights, clearly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary than before.
No matter what they think, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone’s head.
University of Lappeenranta to achieve savings of 8.5 million, personnel to be cut by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings course, which aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University will initiate co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means that about 130 employees will be cut.
An additional two million will be saved.
The basis for the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which predicts that the actual operations will be in deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding is visible in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will start next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks, as stipulated by the law.
Onnibus wants to go to the Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK,” Souter said.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there will be long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe, has reported interest in rail transport from other international companies.
U.S. Central Bank's Interest Rate Decision Time
The entire world is following the meeting of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
More than half of economists, who thought the central bank would raise interest rates last week, are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current rate of between 0 and 0.25%, according to a survey conducted by 80 economists at Reuters.
“This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero, thereby triggering the normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been in a relatively good state, and the stimulus has brought trillions of additional dollars to the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. CEST.
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apology Note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note in which he apologizes for the first murder and hopes to be able to undo it, officials said Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb asked the police to come home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house who is no harm to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man did not say it.
Lamb also gave no motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, as well as a handwritten note by Lamb, which read as follows: "I am very sorry and wish I could reverse my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police reached him.
University Rector William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that there was clearly something bothering Lamb.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangle drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
He said his mother and daughter were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, told us that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles stated that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them he was not going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to a resume on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Dim stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will have to stand aside for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the pitch this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defensive area by Héctor Moreno's poor tackle while fifteen minutes were running in the game.
Shaw received first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal stated.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery in Manchester.
A young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has gone through a rough time and is now injured after a great gameplay.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when a leg breaks in two places, he's sidelined for half a month and doesn't play in the block stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have made it by little when the situation did not result in a red card penalty kick.
The match judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't describe in words how overwhelmed I am. My recovery starts here and I'll come back stronger."
More about Manchester United’s Luke Shaw in a PSV match
The defender of England has a special reason to recover to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such cases of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing for Mexico, the Netherlands, led by Van Gaal, only at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry, as his intention was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation myself.
I just saw a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, every parent will realize that their child is learning their favorite books almost by heart.
Except for what you see, David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Association asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text posted on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always some picture or message we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next passage where Cameron is to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to complete the brief original text.
"In the city of need, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see the real tree," the text says. In the version of Dr. Seuss Geisel, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, Ted had no object of crush.
If this is not suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of need, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him. Greedy Kerskanen destroys trees and makes Supplies of them despite opposition from the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, moustache-like creature that protects forests.
Likely, a public relations task of this kind, of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to one who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text probably came from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further, but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of the England team, but it's still tough
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tour, a repeat of the defeat of the last 3-0 Test series is not to be expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong - they have no bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a balled player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is clearly difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks under challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I’ve said before, players are the best pickers.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance as he hits more runs for Yorkshire.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me; he is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long a Test hitter gets the opportunity to make an impact is difficult.
Lyth received seven national games — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton had an opportunity in both home and away matches.
The only thing to complain about is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he's a hitter that I appreciate very much.
He is an unknown factor cricketer, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be allowed at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start batting with Cook, thus getting an extra twist pitcher into the game while holding four quick pitchers, and I am not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to a top pitcher being able to bat here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have achieved much in his local team at Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first substitute player before he could start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup spiral pitcher, and from what I have seen of him, he has proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats — an average of 31 points as a batsman and 35 as a pitcher — and this can be a long shot, but very many twisters have not shown that they are ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawardene, as an advisor to Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men in the sport, bringing a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on the white ball leg of the game and brings both energy and mercilessness.
I think he has always seemed to be suitable for international cricket, whether his role as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a stimulant.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day matches, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
While not everyone agrees, the coaches and electors do not set the match schedule.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp could win if economy is in bad shape 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is day by day in an increasingly deep swamp, even without pleasing Jeremy "yes or no" Corbyn being elected as Labour leader or the TUC scoffing at Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wrinkling, even if not all of them are self-imposed, and some Member States are tired of the self-righteous British agenda, which includes dissenting concessions and damaging Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC's annual congress decided that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it eroded social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda, for example.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in the capitals of different countries, capture a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking figures, return home and say they have made allies for reform.
It's all about me.
“Don’t leave us alone with France,” Berlin says, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point of not caring whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent reasonable chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the post before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing re-election or the election of a successor in 2017.
His power is also waning.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the selfie Brits, who could better use their energy to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, and neither do they, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of such ministers may plan to deliberately throw useless comments on the Scottish National Party style in the UK's 2017 popular election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was an arranged affair, "the United Kingdom had nothing left to deal with the renegotiation."
Europeans know how the British press preys and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, the result of which was a 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remembers distantly Boris Johnson, a shrewd Euro-opportunist who became known as "our EU direct banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include tax evaders, phone hacks, and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought roughly the same about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was more blairish than Blair when he opposed the referendum, after all, Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in a referendum in 2005, Blair got away with it conveniently.
The press never forgave him either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who was kind enough to pat me on the back at Westminster on Monday. I told him he had no more time to waste on me. There could be a risk that he would adopt Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s. It was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn must develop a coherent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukipin and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week when her inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint tough John McDonnell as shadow Treasury Secretary.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father had trouble on television being disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU "under all circumstances". neither did Mr McDonnel say so to his colleagues in Corbyn and members of the House of Commons in a private meeting on Monday night.
Wanted Corbyn to convey how sweet the image is, it must be remembered that he touched even me. Communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media throes, where paranoia and deception are smoldering.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass for the EU to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum, as McDonnell has stated.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivocalism of EU membership fits into the Bennite blockade economy and the anti-capitalist past. Discussions no longer belong only to a narrow circle of leftist dissidents, for whom the idea that similarity unites is a central tenet in doctrinal quarrels.
There has also been an equivocation on NATO. Tom Watson is unflinching in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for the departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have skeptical voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts made during the Tory regime, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Statements by British Authorities on Electronic Cigarettes
According to the researchers, the government-funded institution’s claims that e-cigarette smoking is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking emerged at a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence presented by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) Report on e-cigarettes by the Public Health Authority.
PHE described its report released last month as a "transitional and comprehensive review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
The Lancet Medical Journal editorial last month took on a "substantially easy foundation" on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers at the BMJ have considered whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Europe, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model was intended to harmonise participants’ views on the harms of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled into the study.
According to McKee and Capewell, sponsors of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, in the Sustainability Report, the Managing Director demonstrated its support for BAT's public health activities.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting provided funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
The selection criteria for the composition of the panel have not been clarified, but there are several well-known proponents of e-cigarettes, some of whom admit their involvement as an industry financier.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco manager.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group’s research report shows that there is no undeniable evidence that products are harmful to a wide range of products and meet their criteria.
However, the links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes can promote smoking among children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellness at PHE, said the allegations had been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every second person who smokes throughout their lives dies due to tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not demonstrate, in particular in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths in the UK each year, and smoking costs public health care £2 billion a year.
Responsible behaviour requires us to clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, who led Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain shows, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said commercial rivals would give their right hand for hit shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other television stations.
He criticized the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as those of the competitors' high ratings, as well as on BBC4, for example.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, without success.
"I don't agree with the idea of the BBC buying formats and broadcasting programs that clearly belong to the programming of a competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least reduce its offer to programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice for best quality because it wants the widest possible support in the future as well.
If no other channel takes the show, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is a production of its own.
Many channels would give their right hand to it.
I do not understand how this serves the service of the broadcaster.
I don't think that would be a loss for the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2006, and he thinks that the BBC has good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to that of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested with his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC would sell off shows such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC's programmes for a niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings are most often not measurable, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "The BBC can say, in defending its hypocritical missions, that the £4 billion broadcasting fees did indeed special programs that no one watched."
"BBC presents them at times no one will ever see them".
Regarding broadcasting charges, Johnson stated, "I challenge you to find another system as old-fashioned in the sense of who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is advantageous, but the people for whom it's a big sum, especially if you don't watch much of the BBC."
Former Sky and Channel 5 channel director David Elstein, who also expressed his views on the committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should trade its ancient missions for new "information, teach and entertain".
According to Elstein, the BBC's current offering is unlikely to include educational programmes — 1% on television and 0.1% on radio — he adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and reformulate its mission: "to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the issue of collaboration, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts of events such as the Proms festival, which only a fraction of the concerts were broadcast last year. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire supply available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves with the help of sonogenics
The video shows how the nematode changes direction when ultrasound is applied to them.
Scientists have grown worms that have genetically modified their nervous system, allowing the worms to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound, the frequency of which is above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that responds to ultrasound.
Scientists monitor brain activity through light
According to the researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sonogenetic method called dubbed sonogenetics. The method utilizes ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with stimuli from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
However, Chalasani noticed that the worms begin to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify the ultrasound waves that advance into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are found in some of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that controlled their motion appeared TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and moved to the worms, causing the nerve cell to emit a signal.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain by optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be temporarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful tools of torture —at your door!
Adverts are a disgrace to Britain’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking legcuffs!
Cluster bombs!
Remote tasers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and cartoons clearly reveal that the advertisement for the world’s largest arms fair is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government’s efforts to sell weapons to repressive governments at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) at the ExCel Convention Center in Docklands, London.
DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
There are also posters popping up at bus stops and subway cars that require a second glance.
"Important announcement: do you take the subway between 15 and 18 September?" The announcement resembles the announcements of the London Metro. There is a picture of the tanker at the end of the metro line on the other side.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers will be asked for help to stop the arms fair".
Three hundred posters have been created by artists whose work was on display at Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London with a six-pound "ad space hacking package" with hex keys allegedly giving access to about a third of the advertising poster stands at bus stops in the world.
Transport for London is no joke.
One of the prank commercials for the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question issues and want to bring their political work to the public for viewing outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art is brought into the real world, and many move to work with activists from protest movements.
Another anti-arms poster greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty International’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over the last 24 hours via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narrator have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of VCCP, was surprised by the absence of trade show advertising and the empty spot on ExCeL's event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to compose a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract attention better."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring up fairs where illegal torture equipment trade is taking place," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded right at our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative part of the arms fair is on display in the exhibition space ExCeL itself, where exhibitors make use of fantastic euphemisms of their merchandise.
In a press release, Saab announced an order made by the U.S. military for a "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a specially designed warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
8 golden rules for students living in dormitories
I moved into a student dorm 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in berets and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I irritated, and countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory is at its mildest a stressful experience and at its worst a shocking one.
It’s easy to start babbling: you tell everyone where you are, whether you had a gap year and why, what you like about Corbyn, and why you don’t “really hate or love Marmite, because that’s just yeast extract, hahaha, I’m in my room.”
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show interest and ask questions of others.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn’t even talk to when your eyelashes were on fire and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give others room.
Private rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but a private room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
Don’t even think about combining dating and university studies.
College is a tough place for introverts.
However, many dormitories form a social culture in which people wander from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
This kind of culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
In this environment, it is not possible to state, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used to socialize with you.”
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and instead send a text.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my college dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies conveniently when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you personals."
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you. A tasty surprise can leave them with a positive image of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable baking skills.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offense in student dorms.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop of someone else’s milk into your tea?
Always check with the owner of the milk can.
You will probably get permission, even if the milk quote would be from the owner of the can.
I understand that it’s annoying if someone steals something from you, but try to handle it as adultly as possible, unlike my own college friend, who used detergent on his milk as punishment for milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don’t make any noise when others are trying to sleep or study.
Not only is it polite, but it is also worth remembering that every other person digs a hole...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the neighboring room to adjust the music to a smaller size, for it was three o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When she finally got quiet in the next room, she let the neighbor sleep for two hours, left for three hours for the exam, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future spouse to move into the same dormitory?
And wouldn’t it be strange if you first thought your college friend was your future spouse, started dating, divorced, and had to see him every day, and lost the visitation rights of your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If your student friend is definitely not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you find in a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is unlocked, the line between prank and bullying is more blurry than you might think.
A good joke is fun, but one you can recover from in a moment.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be soiled with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door of another room and drop the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach anyone’s belongings to the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple of times more.
Racist attack on foreign students’ accommodation in Kitee - The house planned to be a reception centre was tarnished in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the residence of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers but sleeping quarters for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukainen, teacher at Kiteen Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodation facilities, the police in Eastern Finland said.
According to Luukkainen, who is the responsible teacher of the youth guarantee education at Kansanopisto, an estimated ten people were in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed in the folk high school.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the cluttered building has a "A" status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A-status is a permanent residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held on Monday for the students, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had over a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukainen says.
According to the lock, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men and had been in a light-colored car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend evening when this topic has now been on the surface.
“Nothing more serious,” he said.
There is also a hospital in Salo that is planned to have a reception centre.
The incident occurred last week.
It was announced on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written "You are not welcome" in English.
A crime has been reported to the police.

The state is shutting down the Y-train to Karjaa - the passengers are angry, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raseborg’s Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers arriving at the Helsinki Central Station in the early evening of the train in question.
In particular, the people of Siuntio are hit by the downfall, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can depend on nothing but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video for HSTV that he will come to the capital in a tractor, for example.
There are also train changes in other parts of the country.
The main line H and R trains will be merged into a new R line.
Purola’s station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase rail services during the next agreement period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Committee on Finance.
Siuntio-based Bengtström considers that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those travelling further away from the urban area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trip," he said as he climbed on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the railway line, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to examine the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is not yet possible to accurately estimate the cost.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, but the Ministry of Finance has of course paid much more than this.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer buy rail services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made on the routes to be discontinued, while the total number of trips in transport purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is expected to bring the state $12.3 million in annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's topicality: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes George Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland, in the book The Currentity of Marx Capital, published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization and penetration of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University professor, a respected economics expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
However, the former President of the Institute of Economic Research and the Delegation of the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist, is he?
Oh, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not view Marx as a topical economic thinker, but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technological upheaval,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
However, Marx is worth looking at.
“In the 1970s, Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls on war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN has called for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, according to the AFP news agency.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and insurgents known as Tamil tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The number of victims is not known.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
Sri Lankan armed forces are accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the creation of a UN court due to foreign judges.
England’s New York City Test Is Weighing Social Media
On Wednesday, the matriculation examination took place in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
You could write an essay on social media.
From our own experiences, we had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250-word essay could be addressed to the administrator of the online magazine’s advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
There were four subjects in total, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school.
The third item was just a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the whole experiment as "pretty normal."
In the English test in Finnish - or Swedish - you were able to answer questions about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of zucchini to climate change and the processing of large amounts of information.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn’s writings will continue on Friday, when there will be a test of another domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is held normally, which means that the employees’ demonstration does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board advises candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the test event.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commandand hat covering his face.
He has a normal body and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a serious robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11.00 a.m.
Police are also expected to take part in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to take care of the alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the massive demonstration takes place.
Roads leading to the railway square will be closed to motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Traffic from the Hakaniemi direction will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the west direction.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, that seems to be enough.
I do not take a stand on industrial action by the police.
According to Kujala, support patrols from elsewhere in Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police will not tell you the exact number of patrols.
“Something is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urged to avoid private driving in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning to early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, Helsinki is also home to a large number of charter buses.
They are not allowed to enter the railway station.
Buses are generally far away.
The rest of the way must then walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the point of view of the police, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of on its own.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are either ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in various parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison point in Finnish political history,” says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen of the University of Jyväskylä.
It’s no wonder the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of things to do with the fact that the trade union movement is actually trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all employees for the demonstrations on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a break-and-break Thursday in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Breaking Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Aho (center) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as under the bourgeois government in Aho.
Now, relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of the break-in.
In addition, Finland’s most bourgeois government will ever be in power, Siisiäinen says.
The current government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to be there on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish trade union movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, and we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisäinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstrations has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also impressive strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and Electrical Strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Reconciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men were given a 16% raise.
The spring of 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Breaking and Breaking in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people gathered in front of the House of Parliament, many of them made unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were hit by egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
In Spain, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting site.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass dismissal of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually brought the negotiations to an end.
Doctors on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forcibly," was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favor of student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation finds out the background of a Finnish truck filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police in Aisterheim, near the German border, stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone on board the cold truck was in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company engages in restaurant business, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqis have been arrested for smuggling.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman: the story of five smugglers
A rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a classy missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death's Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of their heads right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
In terms of their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain and father of six children in the chain.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for the fisherman to transport people.
This is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia for him.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis erupted again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers can barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
We're going out at midnight with lanterns turned off.
On the first night you drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on his return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least claims he's going to beat the shit out of them.
He says in the book that when the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers by the neck one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's gonna have to beat his countrymen for this.
I'll beat them out of their heads right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running its last and in any case it has seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 km southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly open to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families are housed in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
Arriving in the Bogovaða region, a major hub of human smuggling, people are dying tired.
The Goran riders are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says Africans are trying to compromise.
That's not what Goran likes.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about three hundred kilometers away, most of it conveniently on the highway.
They say they're asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is quite a nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to be allowed to transport migrants closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about that: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and squeals away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many Christians who have fled the Congo are visited, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and onward to Europe.
The client will first call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money snugly, and strolling among the peddlers who cross the border.
In order to be eligible for asylum or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will provide the client with a new identity.
The old ID will be destroyed and replaced.
That's where the Missionary contacts with Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process to a European country, for example, 4 500-7,000 euros.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, an ex-drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on call off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks bound for Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They drive the A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to a rest place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck... to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example... and cuts off the safety wire on the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but it is more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not sneer at the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
The Upporian Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which dominates sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and is constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented out yachts to take American or European families on comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who, for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, are first transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once it's delivered, we'll have to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury boat trip after the costs.
He does not take care of practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are arranged and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred homes through cover companies, which he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of parliament of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in her book Fast Girl, talks about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the Games in top condition and ran in qualifying for the second best time.
In the final, he panicked.
He rushed to the top at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was overtaken one after another by other competitors.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
“I forced myself over the finish line,” Favor Hamilton said in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he yearned for adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, she was world number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Finals.
World champion rejoiced when union put Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straightback"
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the athlete’s contract throughout the summer and autumn of last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
Following his contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski cock in check.
"Thank you for pointing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I have been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug announced that he would like to play in the Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup and then at the World Cup and Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two gold ones.
He was part of the team that won the relay gold at Falun last winter.
Roast translators’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. 25.9. there will be an event in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Roast Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as a part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but the top restaurants inspected and classified by an independent operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day will be held in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant will take part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events of the organisation, which will take place on the same day around the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of Kauhava reception centre was filed with the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in co-operation to establish a refugee reception centre in the Kauhava ex-guard facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkko Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Air Force Academy, the impact of which has also not been investigated in preparation for the reception centre.
For the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy of the Ministry of Defence.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of opposition in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially at a time when we are facing great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
He is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also discussed.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, starts closing for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia reports that the operations of the airports will be handled by supervisors during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
Protest closes the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say that the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars around 9.30-14.
Cars from the Mannerheimintie direction are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
Subway and tram drivers at all Friday’s demonstrations
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Tram and Metro Association told STT about it last night.
Most of the beginnings will be closed for two hours, even when the mails are closed.
Friday’s protest will also cause disruptions to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross's blood transports will be handled despite the strike.
Meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples will also be handled.
Situational information on the services is available on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alkos will close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The services union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to take part in a trade union demonstration.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with superiors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki Daycare Centres Partly Closed
The daycare centres in Helsinki do not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and club activities at day-care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to inform more about the changes tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Takes a Big Risk
According to Sipilä, communications need diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
Such a direct-talk channel will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, he told reporters.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be communicated on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as channels, then we'll see.
We are going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires the public to speak on television and radio.
This whole issue, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That’s why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21:05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
The horse takes a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not be about a more general government inward turn.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more firmly into your own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcement issues in a democracy.
The task of media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken into account.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more to offer today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one has to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if this is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a means of communication between politicians or the Parliament and the Government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or in general policy.
A clever bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should take a close look at what Sipilä is and isn’t doing,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, because this way he can express his own views without any gravel noises.
This will get the message to the general public without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether the sweat drains, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform something, because it is here that a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his colleagues do regularly.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be exceptional for the citizens.
He said it has not happened in decades for the Prime Minister to speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that are ahead.
Workers’ organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against the government’s actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a notification by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) says he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can’t hide from the endless,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy has been found, and while the boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
He went out to play at 4 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who have helped in the search.
Thank you for the tens of contacts and observations over the course of these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in young people’s violent fad: You create hatred
Kurdistan mixed martial artist Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that specifically appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a strong speech against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of MMAs.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos of young people fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the youth fad.
26-year-old Amirkhani has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people on the ground, sit on top of the other and hit the other without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this.
Hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's just that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku points out.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageous.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a while.
That’s a different way of thanking you for being here,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by someone’s racism, you have to blame yourself for that.
Now think a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent activities contribute to racism.
You're making me hate something I don't like.
You’re going to have a pretty bad time anyway, and you’re not going to improve them at all,” Amirkhani says.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employees’ association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
The Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said this on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the five per cent productivity leap target.
Next Next post: “It’s a bit weird to beat a fist”
It feels a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from one side to the other in the employee camp.
Is the government going to be overturned, or is it going to be settled?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK poured out holy hatred against the government of the republic.
The whole country was threatened.
The threat spread to the Akavas as well.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, STTK’s chairman Antti Palola (sd) made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava’s chairman Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his settlement paper was already ready.
At first there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, SAK would have to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s government.
Jukka Ihanus, the right-hand man of Palola, was previously special assistant to the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described that the government’s trade union expertise has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a little bit of life away from the Finnish solstice, whose frontman is Marko Piirainen (sd) of ACP.
It's a little weird to shake your fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, said Mongolia is a better host for the OSCE than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July jubilee meeting in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been placed on the European Union's sanctions list to arrive at the meeting - an issue that the President was able to remind journalists about.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again,” Naryshkin said, according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he was also blocked from entering.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation was able to reach Mongolia without complications, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should have no obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is chairing the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets a real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Today, Tappara and the Clave continue their bull days in Hakametsä, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal party in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday he went to Kuopio to drill for a 3-2 extension of KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Tuesday was much more minor.
The Blues, who started off in a tangled manner, had a round score of zero, and a loss score of 2-3.
Hard play, goals tight, if they play the same game as last year, Lock-back Janne Lahti anticipates still lifes on the club’s website.
It has become quite a playoff nightmare.
In the last two seasons, he has just finished the final series.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match was required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who both rejected yesterday get a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lukko poles.
Point of view: The worst play going on in ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the Rocky film, in which he himself played the lead.
The underdog sensationally battled heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
The nameless and wood-handed pot pack advanced to the 2006 Finnish Championship Finals to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Pori's Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
She became a blonde.
A great TV commentator, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Aces has built a potaka on the basis of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been punching guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than discus play.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead actor in Rocky, written by Toivola, as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates hard play, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Aessien Garret Stafford tackled Tappara Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not approve of such a game and it does not belong to ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
This season’s team is strangely built.
There's trains, there's veterans, there's cops, there's bulldozers.
There are practically no key players in the best age of play.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence your player acquisition, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have an impact on procurements and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
Aces' balance in the three league games of the season has an equal number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan should not have written a sequel.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under her husband’s guidance.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to former Apulanna bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka’s direction for the first time.
Olga’s role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, about the early years of Apulanta, is the drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother, Sirkka.
Cricket cheers and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model, the easier it seems.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They met, talked on the phone, and texted.
Cricket has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and it was really dreary.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka from her youth even before film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, then how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's notorious skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuukka.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a large joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iitti often plans to drive home for the night because the distance is not too long.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to clear them.
Iron Sky 2 becomes Finland’s most expensive film
The budget for the film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, is 17 million euros.
Filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the science-fiction film Iron Sky: The Coming Race will become the most expensive drama film ever made in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is currently under construction, will also go past Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I have been so sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told Evening Magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, you could stuff 100 million into the movie, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no looseness at all.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Is it hillbilly or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ breasts have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen as somewhat of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so many times before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. conventional fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, we put on the shirt buried at the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas’ recognizable stripe shirts, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to show off the logos in your dress?
Russian politician says he didn’t get stuck in tank hatch for hours
According to the allegations, a peculiar incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to showcase Russian war industry products.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Services had to remove the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page in which he appears to be peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a pretty good mood and, at least from their pictures, it’s not about getting stuck or angry.
It's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
For the Russian military TV channel Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia in the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks,” Zotov said.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
“I’m tall and rough, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank, didn’t happen,” he told Russskaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged jam have been released, although a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck originally started with a Bloknot.ru case where Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to eventually shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition gave their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours,” said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite blogger's
The Candle of the Architect Brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 looks as if it was designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and it was originally.
The architect brothers are known to have refined the shape of the candlestick for a long time and with mathematical accuracy.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
Kubus candles are produced by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the renowned brothers.
Candles are hand-made in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candle versions, in four different colors.
Kubu is black, white, nickel and copper.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings sink into the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The basin contains neutralised tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually the water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, according to the permit, passed through the surface drain field to the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to dam structures in the basin.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against over-cutting
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are slight differences.
The IMF's assessment has a lot of message to send to the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to achieve 0.4% growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth this year to be zero in its new economic forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
On the other hand, less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the difference is only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo Recovering from Death Appoints New Leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start his job on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata’s footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognized that hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors are missing every year, according to reports from SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications for minors who have come alone were submitted in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who have come alone.
There are no total statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers missing this year, but the number of minors is therefore known and it has increased clearly, which is likely to have an impact on the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have been converted?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "black job market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of decisions on deportation,” Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who was considering refugee issues at the EU Home Affairs Council meeting on Monday, told about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who has lost his working ability due to illness, for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net that were once one of the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online advert was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological progress.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interested parties.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move away from his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all that stuff with us.
I’ve slowly started to inventory and see what things are being given up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for radio and television equipment.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up a box of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend force action in connection with Friday's protest.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it is decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the oud is big on the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift allowances badly hurt drivers, so there is opposition to the government's plans to cut the allowances.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area will be almost completely at a standstill.
According to VR, the trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP members will be absent from work from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by supervisors, says Pirkko Repo, a spokesperson for HSL.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services run on Friday.
Workers’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim Boy Arrested at Texas School After A Teacher Thought A Self-Made Clock Was a Bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought a self-made watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, police had stated that the watch looked like a "film bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohammed was sentenced to three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the American-Islamic Council in the country is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green felt Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service commemorated the fight of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn is scheduled to appear in parliament as party leader for the first time today during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families.
Minnesota family killing still unclear, family's father facing lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family shooting in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on 10 September and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of the children at school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead across the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Dollars and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 offers from the company in the last 10 years.
I have abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
In 2011, the Short family bought a house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
She had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various preparation courses, for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments defamatory of preparation courses had been removed from Short's site, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri served cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award in the race event.
This is great, Loiri comments with a good mood on her board of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work when working with the horse.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri.
NHL star's "biggest athlete's donation ever made"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
It is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens.
Subban’s donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
In the past, the players of the Canadiens have made a significant contribution to local hospitals.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife at the Japanese cafe for the evening - only bikinis and a apron are served
Coffee shops are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, rabbit cafe, vampire cafe, hug cafe and now a wife café on the market.
It hits the lonely, the sore and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
You can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening at the Ore no Yome café in Tokyo.
It is a waiter who pretends to be the client’s spouse.
The "spouse" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is faced with nothing but an apron and bikini, while the husband is faced with tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information on the height and weight of the candidates for wives, including the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars began to be geared up
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry,” Intel said in a statement.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing safety tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford’s Focus RS has been waiting for years to come.
The car is finally in sight in Finland.
Ford has announced RS data at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
With its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine, Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 km/h.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, initially it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available to order, although the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia presented two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
More important than in Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is sure to be the most important of the two innovations, which Kia intends to use to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, Sportage is more round than before.
The wheelbase and the outer dimensions have become one centimetre here and the car cuts through the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be announced closer to the sale.
We still have to wait a little bit for that, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in Finland.
It doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Initially, Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines will be introduced.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the Optima farmer will start to sell.
Chisu returns to the stage, wearing a bold overall
Singer Chisu is present at the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue panty suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the graceful waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned by a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year hiatus, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really make me nervous.
I’ve missed all the music, the singer said.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release their fourth album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album.
Kim Kardashian’s motherhood style is amazing again
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after another.
She shows off her gestational stomach and chest outfit in generously sexy clothes, the last time last night at one o'clock American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the show with husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress as the lightning lights flicker.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last Friday, when the presentation was scheduled for a pregnancy.
The Tough Laws of Modeling: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Horrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to straighten out the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak out about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you were posing in top designer outfits the previous season, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with seniors.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
Work is a constant journey and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are constantly together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference will be sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just an introduction to clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors who have a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York City is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I’m about to be a 26-year-old rapper, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar person in this group, so I think it’s good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to impersonate people.
The man who leads Scrooge Salminen and Dogs will not play the role.
Punk mangers come with a man naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I’m sure many people saw a taste of it, as well as if they’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, we always go full-blown.
Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta between 1993 and 2004, directed the film You Make Us Beautiful. The main actors were announced today.
The core group that has become familiar to the band's audience is presented to the general public by relatively unknown young actors.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo by bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip on his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge posted a photo of his new look on Instagram that he had to make for the movie.
Scrooge, previously seen on mustaches and chin beards, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees who are going to Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the matter to be discussed, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the Finnish Social Democratic Party’s crisis group.
Younger children should be protected, for example, not let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is a good idea to discuss the starting point of the child and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
Children’s fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
There is no need to scare a child in vain, even if you are distressed and afraid.
Younger children follow their parents’ behavior closely.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe too.
Older children will likely come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is a good idea for parents to discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how this will be felt in our family.
After all, is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family is also talking about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come with life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker”
Your strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
It's hard to control ball lightning that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine Cpila’s Ballsalam into a blast in the middle of summer.
It was only a win and a second place until the end of July when the race in Tampere came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with his protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the vantage point.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Clover’s Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says she was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE mare in its record time in Turku after Taruntuuli.
He was under a lot of pressure when he was only able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Considering these things, the slight bending at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the stallion sharp.
The horse's tone was definitely moving forward, and hopefully it would have stabilized as well.
The ball has been called humorous horses.
When it's not fun, it can be thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have lost such lightning tension that their opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors are no match for the Ballbolt, which can even detach warm-blooded rides.
The hope of the North is in Vermo.
However, it is a matter of how the ball will do it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and you might even be snuggling under the boom of the starting car and all that.
Hopefully it will be calmer than going down.
Cpila’s Ballbolt is able to come from the front as well, and we’re going to drive it for the win, the coach promises.
This Is Why You Can't Get Rid of Unnecessary iPhone Programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future — but not quite all.
Apple is likely to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, said Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook said removing Apple’s programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps worked closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company does not want to waste memory space on iPhones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the European Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% slightly downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called core inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, there was an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU’s harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2% price increases over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area at an average of 0.1% this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the Fed starts raising its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that it will start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
This means that the next recession may be at its fastest by next autumn and the pace of the financial markets before it.
Or at least that’s what happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets operate as they used to, and if they react to the blackmail of the Fed’s money taps as they did in the past.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international clients last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical findings, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates increases — and what might follow.
It becomes clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more fragile state to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
The recession may not start for a year.
Throughout last summer and early autumn, leaders who decide on the Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have hinted that the time is beginning to mature for interest rates to rise.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years could occur this week.
The matter will be resolved in the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed Board’s so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter in its two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rate increases of 0.25 percentage points, which lasted for exactly two years, increased the Fed’s interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
The last time serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than at any time since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world’s largest economies, as well as the reversals in financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact are reported since the 1950s.
Less than a year has passed since the start of the recession at its fastest time since the first interest rate increase, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has taken turns raising and lowering its policy rate by a dozen cycles of different dimensions.
Each time has differed in some respects from the others, and the narrator is considered relatively sparse, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the subsequent interest rate increases.
This time, the strategy reminds us that many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, are not necessarily identified, even by decades of research.
But three of the causes of the crisis and its destructive effects must be somewhat unquestionably clear:
In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB, and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno-bubble, while growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in different parts of the financial and real economy grew even more due to the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in the history of the economy to date.
(3) In particular, the crazily cheap debt financing packed into the financial economy, almost without restraint, inflated the largest exchange bubbles in the history of the financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities, in most sectors of the financial market.
Again, there is hardly any serious controversy that, on the basis of ever more complex leverages, the high-level financial markets were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures tuned to debt leverages, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last until after their time after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give some thought to such things as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been crazy for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper at its cheapest than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a much heavier debt burden than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
(3) Liquidity issued by central banks at a higher and lower price has largely remained on financial markets and has led to the most expensive of key securities and assets, whether at the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do strategists use the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades, as it has been in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next sets out to tighten its money taps.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Societe Generale’s strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time been coaching international investor clients of the Bank for the following turnarounds of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be made to HP’s business services side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PC machines and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have 25,000 to 30,000 employees cut.
The consumer side's reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
As recently as last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (center) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, for which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a board member.
Berner himself says he has filed a resignation notice for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs Board of Directors and in a Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg-based company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family-owned company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income of Finnish companies is taxed in Finland, and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre operated by a company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to accommodate the first 100 residents as early as 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is particularly the provision of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on the security arrangements of the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package for the government’s working life blackmail.
The organization also wants to include other central employers’ organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the focus is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of labour will then return.
“Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday,” Palola told reporters during a break in the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a debate if you have a one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-one-to-
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position as to whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, the cut in Sunday allowances, in particular, is a painful place for the staff organisation STTK’s field.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is implementing some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, STTK does not want to warm up to the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the SDP that has been on the agenda.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, wages for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Akava’s chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK’s announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming into line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that Lauri Lyly, led by SAK, will join in the preparation of the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a five per cent competitive leap for the government as an alternative to the cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Sture Fjäder, Chairman.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that is suitable for the government and employers of the country,” Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
University of Tampere Green Left Viva bingo coupon for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä Rebellion and Wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on YLE channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister’s previous speech, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio address, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen put an end to the strike of train performers with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchy
All day long, the speech has sparked criticism and conjecture about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, chairman of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, "the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) condemned on Facebook that "monarchist attitude: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, chair of the Social Democratic Party, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhaasipila afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
He has been criticized for his speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service’s mission to promote publicity throughout Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications at Yle News.
Just like we did in the Tammels.
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When the evening comes, the dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom wears a pretty coat and my dad fits a tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., let’s sit down in front of the TV like we used to in Tammela,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government sits in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that it is necessary to cut back when the state has run out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
As for what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a related bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear tonight about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia’s proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia’s offer to dissuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan for Assad to step down in style after some time.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council in 2012.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin enumerated a three-point plan for him in a bilateral discussion: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and Assad had to be contacted immediately and al-Assad’s renunciation of power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he sent Tshurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion for the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says that there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, as his experience suggests that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow authorization.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he suspected it was Putin’s trick of holding power with some supporter of Assad.
The flow of refugees from our own actions
During the negotiations with Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own act.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves,” Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The Asylum Seekers ’ Organizer Centre
The asylum seekers’ arrangement centre planned by the government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tornio joint building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Hyöppinen (left) this is not true.
When the whole council was not meeting and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to the Finnish Social Insurance Institution.
There were 36 out of 43 delegates present at the debate.
The Centre was opposed by 13 councillors.
On the basis of this, one would expect the decision to be positive, says Hyppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted to.
It is estimated that there will be 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too,” Nousiainen says.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Extortion
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of labour sought by the government.
However, the Government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for replacements for government-announced work-life blackmails.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, halving the holiday money would work as a means, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday allowances.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday payments, as they have been recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will report to Parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
There is no final deadline either.
The legislative work starts then, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more and more difficult.
Now is a good time.
It won’t take long for this to happen, if you have the will.
The list published by the Government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Helatorsä into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Workers’ organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of sap hall warehouse
The Council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s warehouse, or sap hall, with some grumbling.
The reason for the criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had originally been said to be.
I also have a busy schedule.
It was also a bit surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the 400-450 m2 warehouse expansion was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
An investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200,000 was still discussed on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its previous strong position to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the preservation of Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre in Karelia.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be viewed with a broad mind now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used in a wide range of marketing activities.
Discontinuation of train connections will cut the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all, says the Mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen.
He also raises the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the whole region that we do not succeed in reducing the possibilities of government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Recruitment Manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
At the moment, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siu's war
The view of the Joensuu City Government on the provincial Siun Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board (sd., pictured), proposed at the board meeting on Monday that the whole project should be abandoned, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s proposal for a decision, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one train pair.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains are left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase money for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be stopped altogether.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys ran away.
A 12-year-old who climbed to the roof of the building and was unable to get off the roof on his own, was released by the rescue services.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs adjacent to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away and passers-by alerted the rescue department to help with a pull ladder the last one left on the roof safely back to the ground.
FedEx net sales fluctuations, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak result for the last quarter. The freight industry giant weakened its full-year profit forecast due to lower demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's share fell approximately 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opening on Wednesday.
FedEx forecast is between $10.40 and $1.90 for the fiscal year ending in May. The forecast shows a decline of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a study by FactSet, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite price increases of an average of 4.9 per cent. The increases will take effect on 4 January. Additional fees for heavy or large shipments will come into effect in November.
The company still expects earnings growth from the previous year, thanks to cost cuts, higher net sales and growth in e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has performed well in the weaker-than-expected economic climate, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans to hire seasonal workers were announced a day after the competitor UPS announced plans to hire approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, an increase of 6%.
The earnings per share were $2.42, so the $1.44 forecast by 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research was missed.
Net sales rose five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, revenue was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments, which has caused the company’s Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth in e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit performed better due to higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business declined due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before actual trading opened, FedEx's stock price had dropped to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11 per cent from the year average and by 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on June 11.
This week, Fed decision-makers gather at the most anticipated meeting in years. The group sits at an eight-foot-tall Honduran wooden table to decide if it’s time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues must put the financial interests of the state above all other interests.
The Federal Reserve has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
After the Great Depression, however, the central bank's management has noted a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate could be the missing piece for a tough decision, and on Thursday, the Federal Reserve is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to begin weaning off the unforeseen stimulus offered by the short-term interest rates that have remained close to zero since the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in financial markets may cause officials in an already cautious central bank to fright at increasing volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate — even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Labour markets and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical follow-up,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at banker firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market will provide enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continued.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree on what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists in Bloomberg’s survey predicted higher interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to wait, and according to the key indicator, there is only a 30% chance of a drawdown.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices may fall unless policymakers soften the blow by promising a second drawdown.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average defected 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The excitement was driven by expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this point," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets unshakeable."
For one, experts said that raising interest rates could calm financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when a central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be leaning towards raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, a first small step in tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has stated throughout the spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to rise this year — despite the liberals saying that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% target, the central bank's decision-makers noted that a key reason for this was the temporary impact of steep oil prices.
"The economy can survive at higher interest rates and needs them, as long as they take into account the tight conditions in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , financial markets around the world did not startle last month when China devalued its currency .
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by as much as 16 percentage points from May's record high and investors feared that China's economic downturn would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has already dropped nearly 10% from its May peak.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will become even more complicated when considering raising the key interest rate.
"The central bank's work is becoming more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news of China's economic decline in recent weeks," Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher and former central bank official at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, said.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable data on the situation since the recent development of the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The recovery of the global economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not influence the central bank’s decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential player in the world’s monetary economy.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then-president Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow the scope of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to monitoring trends in the world, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more of an art than a science," Zachary Karabell, director of global strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc, said.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank said this month that the central bank has in the past overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for an increase in the interest rate, such as the 1998 and 1999 decisions.
"The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limited recognizable sanctions were available for US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank overturned the decision.
"The central bank should put monetary stability first only in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Committee.
The latest turmoil does not even come close to the situation at the time," he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates because of the shock of the market," Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this changes, I do not think we should get ahead of ourselves."

The Brazilian Association of Pediatricians in Rio Grande promotes a decent diet for breastfeeding women
The Brazilian Association of Rio Grande Pediatricians SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach lactating women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies being breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food painted on it.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This way, the baby gets all the nutrition he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of the excess energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing the calorie intake, other changes in diet should be made.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for a pregnant woman can affect a baby’s genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers, though Nine is trying to catch the lead on its Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership election, however, which did little to improve Today's ratings.
The Nine channel's morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage's morning show of the rival channel was broadcast from London, with week-long specials also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance apparently did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise was watched by an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and Today by 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but missed last Thursday's reading (343,000).
Today has been catching up with the distance to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, while Sunrise had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers so far.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had an 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novel is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to star in the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the ratings last night, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers. The series brightly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families series (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
The first half-hour (17.00-17.30) of the new quiz series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe was followed by an average of 446,000 viewers.
On the second half-hour (17.30-18.00), the number of spectators rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase in the first half of Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half garnered a staggering 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat had 620,000 viewers.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings showed to Nine that the Hot Seat will pass by another 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams - but who does the man choose?
Was the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
Sam Wood's final choice has been a well-kept secret.
The three remaining women do not whisper a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about the mood before dropping one of the trio. The women may have inadvertently hinted at who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finale.
All three women said that Wood was the perfect man. The women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity, and considered him to be a suitable partner for his qualities.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit their own spot, their answers could give an indication of who would take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has persisted throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah has her feet on the ground and she’s really fun to be around,” Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks of herself and Sam Wood as a good couple.
Mackay said he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race. I am now investing fully in our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose her, she answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor of Dreams on Ten Channel on Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after he moved to the United States. Several other clubs also took an interest in him after last year's impressive open day of practice.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the selection appears to have hit a button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as was the case for the man in the Australian rugby team. Hayne shuffled the fly-kick recovery situation after the team took the win from Minnesota on Tuesday by 20-20.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the flight kick.
Tomsula also continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He did not storm the newcomers in front of the rest of the team but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
Special editor Cam Inman of the 49ers reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles the capture, a game against the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
Hayne and her Australian fanbase had expected otherwise from his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field hundreds of times after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when his pitch in his own area opened a place for Queensland.
Overall, it was an incredible experience for a 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram of her posing together with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia’s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at a Siberian airport.

Four dead after police shoot rubber bullets protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, a source said Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in a protest against the country's alleged new constitution. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, less than 300 km from the capital Kathmandu.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal reported that police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive option, were suddenly so lethal.
This was the latest clash in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe claims its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent skirmishes since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide land into provinces, this is an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where government has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been in work since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake of April.
Lawmakers have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
An extensive low-pressure area about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde could have a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States reported on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear low-pressure center halfway between Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, and there is also a 60% chance it could develop into a tropical cyclone within two days.
Google to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help thousands of people across Europe who have fled war and poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of management, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe escalates, many families in a similar situation are in dire need of help.
Donations are made to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children Association and the UN Refugee Agency.
Once donations have been collected through google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the same amount, bringing the total to $11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since the Second World War, which is exacerbated in particular by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving surgery-free treatment.
“It takes time to get the mortality data,” said Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who discussed the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of studies have concerned morbidly overweight individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The BMI indicates the ratio of body weight to height, where the normal value is between 18.5 and 4.9.
When the BMI is over 25, the person is overweight, and the BMI of over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own BMI at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan utilized data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, with drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After the obesity surgery, the average body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth study year.
The BMI of the patients treated without surgery was maintained at around 29.
In patients undergoing surgery, 36% and 28% of patients had a complete improvement in diabetes.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgically treated group.
The researchers also monitored patients’ haemoglobin levels of A1c, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
According to the researchers, the recommended level of haemoglobin A1c is less than 7%.
After the operation, the haemoglobin A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained the same at around 8%.
However, a team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The research team also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the BMI was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%). In the bypass surgery group, diabetes was also completely improved by a higher proportion (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent).
However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, Sweden, surgery brings years of life to obese people.
In a Swedish study of obese individuals undergoing gastric bypass surgery, the probability of mortality over 15 years was reduced by 29% compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was found in the new study, however, it was confirmed that individuals with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
“When a person’s body has accumulated genetic changes that predispose them to obesity and diabetes, it’s really difficult to reverse the situation.”
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama — RT News
Europe will not be able to take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, saying that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during a visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered his speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, while the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” the Dalai Lama said.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,” the Dalai Lama said.
"After all, we have to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Force has never solved problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that by resorting to force in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After the September 11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that a solution will come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Handicraft swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Center for Poison Control in Georgia, poison centers across the United States report a nearly quadruple increase in cases of ingestion of high alcohol levels in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Center for Poison Control in Georgia, the number of cases reported to poison centers of ingestion in children under the age of 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly available to children, and unfortunately some children are going to have to go to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand sanitizers on purpose, some to impress their friends, and some to incite social media.
YouTube videos feature teenagers drinking disinfectant for cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink even stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of hand sanitizers.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A lot of the attractive hand deci products are just scented.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-flavored hand-dec products that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45-95%.
For small children, even a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of the hands is very high," Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the poison center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot available to children, but if hand sanitizers are often left available to children, they will quickly deliver a large amount of alcohol."
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four drinks of strawberry scented hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
“The girl’s blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult’s alcohol limit,” said Dr. Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah was sobbing and unable to walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the girl’s condition overnight in a separate children’s hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol,” Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products and disinfection wipes in addition to moving your hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontarion women died after ingesting hand sanitizers containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated in the label as an active substance.
According to a police report, three fourth-graders in the northern part of New York State planned in January to kill a "nasty" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizers and forbade its introduction into the classroom.
Police said the plan was meaningless and called for disciplinary action.

Aberdeen's Neck Celtic Five Points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty brought Aberdeen a meager victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The win put Aberdeen on a five-point run over Celtic.
Griffiths downplays talk of discord
Griffiths has ignored rumours of discord in Celtic's ranks. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch league leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch miss the old Scottish fighting pair - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has stopped because they are no longer allowed to watch Celtic and Rangers duels.
De Boer of Ajax's team management stated: "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in the Netherlands. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need duels between the teams.
Old Firm games have tremendous tension, and they are also of interest beyond the Scottish borders."
I'll turn it around, Deila assures me.
Ronny Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian pilot assures that there will be a change.
The club that lost to Malmö was dropped from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
“We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and many people are angry or sad.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's supporters, as it will greatly strengthen the players.
A sense of community is really important now.”
Warburton wary of January player transfers
Although it was only a few weeks ago that Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January's player transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer rule and says he wants to compromise the team's integrity.
"January player transfers are significantly different from summer transfers," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been a success in our line-up this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisition can cause the team more harm than benefit."
Michu, who is considering retirement in Celtic’s sights
Swansea striker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer speeches. Michu, in turn, has hinted at retirement after the Swans contract ended.
29-year-old Michu has been bullied by an angry ankle for years and failed to get transferred from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA battle over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-1. The defender's red card was later revoked. This is already the third Collum red card in eight months, which is overturned.
Neilson, however, remains true to his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded when he admitted to raving abusive song lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local game in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match on the way, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee that I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the ranks of Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures that the Dundee United management team can turn the situation around for the better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy with Hamilton win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen desperately struggled against Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league win. With the win, Aberdeen caught a five-point neck in Celtic at the top of the league table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that has not won such games," McInnes stated.
Unemployment remains unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164 000 unemployed, while the UK as a whole increased by 10 000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12,000 fewer people in employment in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number now stands at 2,612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter and the average employment rate in the UK as a whole was 73.5%.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has fallen.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will be sitting in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary while Richard Glossip is executed by poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through my husband’s best friend and despite my shock, I responded in the affirmative.
As the day approaches, I am terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the true story of the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists get to watch executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than places, participants are selected by macabre draw.
Oklahoma has cut journalists' seats from 12 to 5.
Those who are chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I’m sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends. I’ve established a personal relationship with him because we’ve been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one visit lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of jeopardizing neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a doomed story in a way that pleases him, you will get close to him."
I disagreed with the reporter.
The journalist admitted that she could have expressed her words more carefully, but still felt that what I was doing was wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed about some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do it.
I have told him that he can remove me from the Witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what has happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, the editor of the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about this, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details here.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I'm following his execution.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
An unbiased description can be read in the stories of other journalists.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die in vain.
Man lured from Canning River after watery police hunt
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt was thwarted by shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few meters away managed to land him back on dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call on Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arriving, police spotted a suspect who sought to shake off police by heading for the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police into the water to pick him up," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not attracted to watering the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic —negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt causes a person to resort to amusing means," Sgt. Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown by police and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, officials tried to spy, and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria officials of espionage attempts at his stables last year. The man threatened to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tatain due to treatment given recently on race day was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always working for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample and the man was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue in check over allegations of espionage for a year and a half, and did not want the accusations to appear to be the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration comes off once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want to walk upright, and I want the horse owners to believe that I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to continue as a horse coach.
I’d have to think about my future as a licensed coach.”
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com in which he told about attempts at espionage in the integrity department at his stable.
"One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart were sitting in the same room and offered a man a job in my garage to spy on my activities. I'll tell him his name when asked," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught with anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider it a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the sector on non-coachers?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'll get a coaching license and push me out of my job, and there's no question that's what I'm talking about, making a lot of people think that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make a decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
A long investigation of Lidar's cobalt values and a recent rejection situation eventually made the coach frustrated so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, who described the race day rule as ridiculous after a clay wrap was placed on the horse's feet against the rules.
“The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person on my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and it happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can be expected to face a three-month ban on illegal clay treatment, which organizers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules are made by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested at Cobram crash site
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist this weekend and fled the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital and suffered serious injuries after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to police, the man who drove the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathaliah turned himself in to Shepparton police.
The man is likely to face charges of failure to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still hospitalized, and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy points to opponents' wrestling speeches
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy regards criticizing his team's tackle game as a deliberate action by the NRL's two league favourites.
According to Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, the judges allowed Storm to wrestle to Melbourne hosts' chagrin in a winning qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to Storm after the Broncos won the qualifying finals in the Queensland Cowboys Saturday night. He called the game a model match and stated that there was no particular concern for wrestling in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they only focused on contact while tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that his team was criticized by the coaches of the two top teams. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to Stormi.
"This issue always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-1," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense system or techniques all year long. For the last six weeks, we've only been investing in contact play and tackles, which has turned us up.
Trent has been on this mission for three years, and the loss may have been a shock to him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our Friday game and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George was heavily criticized for his boring game. Wayne stated that the criticism does not flinch him at all.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast center forwards.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have center forwards like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so worried about my team that they rely on this kind of thing.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys encounter.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in the game, but is it interesting football?
Is football and low-level play an interesting sport?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we’ll probably meet them.”
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will have the North Queensland Cowboys' Cronulla Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed on $200,000 bail in drug case
A man awaiting a life sentence for an attempted possession of a 40-pound batch of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a 100-pound cargo of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
Police observed a meeting of Maximovic and an accomplice at the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse café. A 40-pound batch of drugs was found in a Toyota Echo car at the parking lot.
Although Maximovic is facing a potentially life sentence for possession of the drug for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer says there is no evidence that his client was trying to gain possession of the entire batch, but the man may have been in a cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan said there was a risk that Maximovic would try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," the judge said in a court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather jointly paid 200,000 bail, against which the man was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"However, that alone is not enough to prevent the man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and stay at home from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to get paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to get pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was asleep and logged into an online messaging service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, after waking up, the girl noticed the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
After searching the computers found at the address, police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to retrieve inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to police that he had tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and pretended to be police with the intention of scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson stated in the local judiciary at Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation of people.
He admitted to searching on a computer, but claimed to have done so to impersonate the police and thus intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
He said he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who appeared to be much younger than themselves.
The 23-year-old Hogg from Dundeen Ward Road pleaded guilty to charges of possession of inappropriate child images on June 14 last year. Hogg violated his release on bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be put on the sex offenders' register, as it can be considered that the crime did not include significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October due to background reports from social work.
Hogg was granted bail on this issue, but was held in remand on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offenders register even before the sentence was pronounced.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes a wrong speech in parliament
Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of the incident spread quickly on social media.
The parliament's opening was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the President's speech on the state of the state in parliament by intercession, the same speech the President gave on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change whipper Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer immune.
According to the party's whip, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and austerity measures for the business services business.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from the faster growing business hardware and service operations.
The company will record non-recurring costs of $2.7 billion starting from the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who will lead the company after the demerger.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
“As our own company, we are in a better position than ever and better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.”
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual revenue of more than $50 billion and is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to businesses.
Founded in the 1930s by Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the company now splits into two. The two set up an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
Massive restructuring has taken place at HP as the transition from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices is underway.
The changes to HP, one of the world’s second-largest computer manufacturers and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in an industry where concentration is believed to bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb meets
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September, and if everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he should not be able to return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will definitely have to miss at least the next four England national games, and knowing his history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season after a strong ankle injury and seemed to have returned to its former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger stated.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
This is not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field mid-season.
Here, too, there is an unpleasant regularity.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different ailments since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of a total of 157 league games over the past five seasons.
Arsenal's broader picture is that since the 2007-2008 season, with six out of eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams to lose the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes a return after injury can be accompanied by a vulnerable period of needing to strengthen the body and seek competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body in balance, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will start the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing minor changes to the line-up.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starters.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the balance of the team and give rest to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F-Group, Maximir Zagreb has some of the scariest stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games of the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground shook at a strength of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having to bend to Monaco, and he is still motivated by the distant hope of leading the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal has not yet won this title.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, I am also a realist based on my experience.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about male friendship
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide rate of young men is at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 25 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, people with depressive symptoms have a better chance of healing if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The probability of asymptomatic people getting sick was also halved if there were people close to them who did not have mental health problems.
But the basis of all this is friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Superficial success is associated with external values, money, image and social status. All of these distract our inner values and our innate longing for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently said that money really can’t buy happiness.
The beauty of the series was that it turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the show were defined not by profession, but by personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear that the men could relate to this, even though they do not refrain from feeling fully.
A volunteer explained it to me this way: “Listening to people who are depressed and thinking about suicide has made it clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men are supposed to be successful is strong; a man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
“Friends is one of those series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, small moments of friendship between men were emphasized.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family."
In honour of Comedy Central’s FriendsFest, the set of the series has been brought to life. So if you’re attending the event this weekend, it’s a good idea to take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or do something even better. smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central broadcasts the entire Friends series - all 236 episodes - in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were attacked when Paris Saint-Germain started their work in the Champions League by beating Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of play in the debut game. He strengthened the position of the French champions right out of the box. However, PSG screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of play.
In Group A there are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only aims for a follow-up place in the playoffs, but it also wants to improve its position for the quarter-finals in the three remaining matches.
Although SPG caught the score, the match was not a complete show by a team led by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a goal representative position and the man was traded when he was faced with his former home club, where he started his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win and good grips will give us a good foundation, even if we still have something to do for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for the win and we were able to do it, but we regret that we were not able to score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury. The team had to settle for a 2-1 draw in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux over the weekend. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his overshadow at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to PSG ranks, was named PSG's solver, which lifts the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the nomination as he rushed the ball from a pass by Marco Verratt past Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate hit in the back corner of the goal past Johan Willand.
However, those who expected to win the PSG were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marching nine international level players on the field from the start. A team playing with five-man defense and two-attacker tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot barely missed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back post in the 34th minute of the game.
Instead, PSG succumbed to unnecessary pitching and poor finish, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick was pitched to the backs of the goal by Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his fingernails in the pitching game. On Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria shot a round kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was scored at the count's time thanks to Cavan, a sixth-season Uruguayan who shot a hit when Ibrahimovic pitched him left winger Maxwell for the kick.
Malmö's kiri ended in the second goal, and only Wiland's top counter David Luiz shot at close range kept readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned just in the final minutes.
Åge Hareide, the pilot of Malmö, afterwards admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the last Champions League game in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Qualifying isn't enough.
Hats off to the Parisians.
It was a great match for them.”
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion in Share Offering
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, raised US$2.5 billion in a share issue on Wednesday as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in a statement that he had sold new shares worth around £1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market capitalization fell by 57 percent this year, and it is struggling with a collapse in raw material prices as the Chinese economic downturn hampers demand and puts a strain on the market.
With the stock issue, Glencore's share price reached the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The stock rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to a 0.69% increase.
Glencore announced last week its plans to raise $2.5 billion in a stock issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pence, which is a 2.4 percent decrease in Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the entire Group.
Concerns over the continuation of China's economic recession have caused iron ore prices to collapse by half, while the decline in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
A White House statement on Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive on his first official visit to Washington, D.C., on 25 September, following President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between heads of state, U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in honor of the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of mutual interest, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have an opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on topics of disagreement," the White House statement said.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February, and he is expected to visit Seattle to meet several U.S. technology leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip would first continue to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and stated that there is no need for diversity behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight series aired on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to take into account the different views on the project for the black protagonist of the screenplay chosen.
"Diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown was stunned and offended by the claim. "Wow, that's all right," the woman stated after Damon's comment that starred Alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown had gathered with fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists for the race.
"Whoever is the director, I'd like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is portrayed," Brown said at the beginning.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp".
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as the film's directors. Damon responded harshly that the choice of the duo could lead to an undesirable outcome.
When the conversation aired on television, social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct words, "The fact that Matt Damon talks to the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times, and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is the number one topic of speech.
After Michael Brown, a teenager, died from a bullet from a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support across the country. The movement is seeking to end the discriminatory treatment of blacks by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he presented the album nominees of the year at the Grammys.
"The albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether that group should be described as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," the movement's management said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether Damon has responded to the invitation in the affirmative.
American Ninja Warrior's First Winner
Professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for $1 million for his win.
In the seventh season of the TV series, for the first time, all the assigned tasks were cleared.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final task, the men had to climb up the 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task in the given time. He was the first competitor to successfully complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race. However, Caldiero completed the task three seconds faster and became the winner.
After a tough fight, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after catching a million dollar pot.
"The winning amount is incredible as I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his winning pool.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what will happen, the future is wide open."
Executive producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten is not being rewarded, despite being the first contestant to clear all the assignments.
According to the rules, the fastest person wins the prize money.
If more than one contestant solves all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
“The money prize is great and will change life, but Britten will also be satisfied with her performance.
I don't think he'll be able to keep it any longer.
He is just happy with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from fans.
Britten's a great guy for whom family is important.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he did not win, he preferred Isaac to win.
He also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior reprised for the eighth season, with filming starting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers win the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers don't have a particularly nice experience in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of baseball's best teams, are now in last place in the American League Central.
However, the team was successful Tuesday by beating the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to get close to the Houston Astros to fight for the second wild card slot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even for just one night, to a taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every win is nice, no matter how it is achieved," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held his ground when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings of a good game and allowed three runs.
He's only had three good starts with nine outside shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for a change player to throw in every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth inning."
Tigers pitcher substitute Victor Martinez received three hits and batted two runs which were his first beaten runs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he received four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept the tune in the game".
On the last turn of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Middle catcher Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-base hit near the left side line with a oriented punch.
Right catcher Aaron Hicks hit the sacrifice punch, and Simon took the turn of second Brian Dozier, who took three straight passes before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass for Mauer, and rookie pitcher substitute Miguel Sano hit two bases, followed by right-handed Drew VerHage.
With two runners on the field, VerHagen got third Trevor Ploufen to burn two players.
The Major League team led the 27th time this season as Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit hit the confirming run in the first inning of the ninth inning, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon struck a two-run strike, and the situation was 5-1.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight passes and was able to hold the position of his team.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who had just made it back to the field from the injured list.
"Of course, the start wasn't what I'd hoped for. However, as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a good job and a few good passes in the third innings," Hughes said.
After reaching the lead, Hughes gave a single-base hit to second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
A real catcher J.D. Martinez's free game brought Victor Martinez the first imported run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak was cut when the team had players on base.
Nick Castellanos of the third received a single-base hit, one run, but Victor Martinez burned as he attempted to advance to three.
The Tigers added their lead in the second innings. Catcher James McCann survived a hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, with a 3-0 score.
"A fair hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the shot hit the right spot."
The pitcher was Hughes, who pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was traded to right-handed substitute striker A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance came in three runs, six hits, a free bale and four straight passes.
Notable: Tigers' right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not included in the lineup due to a batting shoulder rev.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to a shoulder rupture since mid-August, and was scheduled to be included on Wednesday.
When Sanchez is not playing, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris is removed from the injured list and is part of the starting line-up against the Twins.
Norris has scored 1-1 in four games since being traded to left-handed hitter David Price on July 30.
He has been absent from the lineup since August 20 due to an oblique abscess.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) faces Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
Xi urges to open up the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth," said President Xi Jinping at a meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop a policy of economic opening," the president said at the 16th meeting of the central management group set up to deepen the comprehensive reform.
"By promoting policies of opening up and deepening reforms, a new impetus and vitality for economic growth will be pushed into motion," Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of private capital inclusion in state-owned enterprises, and revision of the citizen registration system.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a major change, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, a legal business environment and market opening.
The Government also reduces the supervision of companies and wants to ensure that companies have decision-making power over their own business operations.
According to the Communication, China will allow the development of new models of cross-border cooperation in border regions as well as the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
With the opening of state-controlled sectors, many sectors will open up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy, supporting the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and providing them with better services," the Communication states.
In addition, applying for a permanent residence permit by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the right of lawyers to exercise their profession and support for judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
