9-year-old boy found in Texas
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy’s escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted and there is no danger to his life and health.
The boy’s father told Ilta-Sanom about midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start looking into the afterlife.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in the game, and he's pulling a goal difference to Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and continued to work in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned, at least for a moment, to the benefit of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid alone moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer record when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetski into the net with two hits from penalty kicks and one from a playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A in the early part of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League it started strongly with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-wrecking Sergei Aguero.
In the weekend major league game, injured Aguero did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United also went through a tough time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old linebacker Luke Shaw's away game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the target at the attacked ManU pack so badly that Shaw likely fractured the tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of scoring in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
Argentinean Angel Di Maria changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG hat.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland in the back corner.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is one of the most successful of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the minor clubs in the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG's star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his starting club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow CsSKA lost in a Group B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for the resignation, the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe resign from his post because he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had taken place solely at Mugabe's headquarters and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech dealt with the impact of China's economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria call for extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders for the refugee crisis next week.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of interior ministers.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a college teacher with only a slight shivering voice, tells police during an emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as said that the contact details of the deceased woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found a note handwritten on the side of Amy Prentiss' body and anger: "I'm so very sorry I wish I could undo this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," the letter said, according to experts, signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the noise.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after students and staff had had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who may have had problems, however.
The students said they were waiting for their classes.
Police at the place where Prentiss died, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he had written, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told me that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring principles meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
University Rector William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the Mississippi suburb of Greenville, according to Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, though Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were melted wax when she was there, said 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told us that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen reported that she had not met Lamb, but had heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that her daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a obscure bar near Gautier, reports that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance to a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We joked and threw things at each other.
They were both quite clever.
The deceased teacher, Schmidt, led a first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the President of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night in Cleveland, a candle devotion was held on the Delta State campus, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the college choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that police now say that Lamb made a 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they have been married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but a toy and baby products retailer says current regulars and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with candidates will begin this month, with the number of staff rising from October to December.
Although months into the holiday season, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, shipping and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox makes a joke about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The movie begins and it occurs to me that I am just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, which interviewed Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it's without a doubt the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time will be available on video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syria will not be resolved
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increase in military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "will not be resolved by armed means", and additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader once again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations with a view to finding a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he plans to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the occasion of the General Assembly ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He deplored the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional powers "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Mr Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show the solidarity and consensus that they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Support Poll Results That Prove Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to label him as a wind vane.
Some people think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) been successful.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been in the lead by a double-digit figure, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the nomination of a real estate king.
Of course, the election is only at an early stage.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got behind any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use their funds to bring him down.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing stage:
Trump’s popularity figures have turned around.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University endorsement polls showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump was the candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson has the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "excited" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio at 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, the favorite in power, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of Republican-leaning voters at the national level think that the property king has the right character for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's survey last week, the number in Iowa, the state that organizes the first convention, is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to a survey by ABC/Post, 44 percent think that his character is inappropriate to be president, and nearly six in ten think that his character does not belong in the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Republican voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
At this time in the last legislature, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans stood for a second candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support is divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump will gain majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie each with 33 points.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a big 18 point difference.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the pro-Trump voters have decided who to vote for.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could change candidates.
In any case, Trump’s biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pomp will drive Hispanic voters further away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said Monday in an ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They're angry at the federal government, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry".
First appearance of Jeremy Corbyn in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask his first of six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for "less theater and more facts" for this weekly screening.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the Shadow Government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war has sparked criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in a number of front page articles.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesperson for Corbyn said he "standing reverently quietly" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be part of Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements on economic, defence and foreign affairs.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences regarding the party's status in the European Union as well as the government's aid ceiling have also "clumped" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a trade union confederation meeting that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Labor and Pensions Secretary Smith stated that the party was "quite clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade, when he has been leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says that he has "crowded" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he intends to refrain from both witty wording and prickly talk, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's finance secretary, Angela Eagle, will replace her in question classes when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further away from the kind of political theater that is often associated with the Prime Minister's questioning hours, but he later had to admit he failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, Question Time by the Prime Minister has been an important measure in assessing the leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Hours for becoming nothing more than a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained to be photographers
Johannesburg is a hard place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound will rise as the UK’s wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in exchange rates.
The pound rose over 1% against $1,5505, and 0.84% against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose 20 percent after rival AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were not only better than expected, but also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Packing and Paper Group Mond's shares were among the largest calculators in the index by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation of the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after the sportswear company announced its six-month earnings before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Harm Expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the UK, it could mean "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs might be targeted at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against intrusion into Aldi sector
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's invasion of southern and western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centers as well as the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, where up to 120 stores are coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food intermediaries and building an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offer tastings in IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, as this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake, with South and Western Australia making up nearly 30% of Metcash’s IGA trading area, with higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
Visitors to shopping in South and Western Australia are notoriously parochial, with IGA dealers having a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the South and 24% in the West, compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the opening of the first stores.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 stores in the west next year, generating sales of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and amounts at Metcash's high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will drop from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a Metcash board member would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the revenue from Metcash’s food and food business, which supplies products to some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations under pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler stands up, and has invested more than $150 million annually in reducing the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that lower prices and improved stores have increased the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves credit rather than criticism for his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
A junior member of the talented duo called "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwittingly exposed to a case in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly after, in a fiery qualifier match in Cincinnati, the chief judge was twice forced to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beat that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi is just being pulled into his brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost due to a cramp in the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he’s behaved very well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for all, but still supporting the Canberraman's return to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has grown up really fast, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public to reflect on these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter illegally, with the aim of damming the flow of migrants entering the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People fleeing violence in their home countries have now pitched their tents and settled for an indefinite period on the road between checkpoints in two countries.
But the frustration grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, the immigrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared that it is "unacceptable" for migrants to return from Hungary as more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"[Serbia] wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbian border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who spoke with hope of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 more refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the continent’s migration crisis.
Hungary does not, however, hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act in the crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum rights cases to be speeded up.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on the matter: it is a crime to cross an illegal border.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military positioning for next week, but the Associated Press journalists at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's Homeland Security Advisor, Gyorgy Bakondi, said officials had arrested 45 people while they were trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They got across by damaging the fence, are now incarcerated by the police, and are charged with violations defined in the new laws.
Authorities will quickly repair the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia after sending a barbed-wired train wagon to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to shove inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in the double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pressing for him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (decreased from 58%), and the second Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary election starts, the majority of Democratic voters state that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the Democratic electorate under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by a double-digit figure among the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter say they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, less Republican voters (35 percent) say the same about Republican No. 1 man Donald Trump.
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted her as a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had appropriate experience (16 percent), followed by the most popular answers was that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cited his association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the vice president influences a potential presidential nomination, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - although a third disagree.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose second to the nomination of the party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will grow, and if Biden goes, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if she drops out, the number will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him the most to be voted on has increased.
However, when Democratic voters were asked what was most important about the candidate, they put opinions ahead of voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidacy or potential candidacy was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden excels best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30 percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally feel that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden agree ideologically.
Looking at all these facts, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, the majority of Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the matter and say that the issue did not affect their public opinion about her.
However, it is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
More than six in ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has gotten worse.
While Clinton's own party voters consider her honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion of him, just like Carson.
The margin of error in a study of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In a new poll, the two candidates garnered half of all the votes, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in the previous CBS poll released on Tuesday, prior to last month's Fox News debate, to 27%.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well among various demographic groups and is ousting Trump among highly educated Republican voters.
The remainder of the pitch has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has dropped most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are ranked third in 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey, conducted in September, is +/- 6 percent.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was also significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged with death of first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternity hazing ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police stated.
Officials say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a backpack of more than 13 pounds full of sand, then repeatedly tackled to the ground as he attempted to walk through an icy field towards the goal.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
Members of the Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but were accused of waiting an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the fraternity's national chairman, Andy Meng, for advice," police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"It was at this point that the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt object blows to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternal spree when at least one student has died each year as a result since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, in a statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County advocated that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to be held accountable only by individuals. If there is an organisation behind what happened, whether formally or informally, they should be held accountable," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity terminated its contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates.
An increase in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will collapse, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
Here's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past does little to help with timing when it comes specifically to the economy.
The recession has sometimes lasted only 11 months since the first withdrawal, and sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why officials at the US Federal Reserve have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the trajectory of the time it takes for the situation to normalize.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss associated with raising interest rates has been overstated.
"The central bank's first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of 'cheap money'," said Julian Jessop, chief financial expert on global affairs at Capital Economics in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to normal, albeit still low, levels to be such a cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate increase can make the situation unstable.
When an increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that return on capital tends to stall for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again potentially reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after the central bank increase.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market tends to be strong, with about 14 percent up when approaching a raise, 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll, a leading capital strategist at Nuvee Asset Management, in a recent analysis published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle when returns begin to decline.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest increases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession.
This is especially true of GDP, which will be the closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
While in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 percent, few believe it will remain while the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for an increase in the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is looking forward to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all increase cycles have so far appeared in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly since recovery has begun,” the report says.
In contrast, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already underway.
The fixed rate of return has also been volatile as the market expects an interest rate increase, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are visible more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The return on bonds appears to change immediately at the time of the first increase/cutting of the cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, the yield on bonds will fall immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates causes a convergence of yields on longer-term and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often yield better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for a return," said Kathy Jones, a solid-yield analyst at Schwab in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adjusted to central bank policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
In general, companies whose businesses are mainly based in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt are performing worse as the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate raise," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report directed at customers.
Companies with strong turnover outperformed companies with low turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (points) and 3 (points) of the former.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Even savers can make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "popularization"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only mimic the Brit Awards
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "becoming" Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding pressure from the production company to prove that it is doing something commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "recognize" its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term 'popular' - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only seem to be the Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples I’ve directly remembered when you’re actually just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, first-class.
"In addition, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, argued that the channel must do more work than previously to reach an audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticized for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is so often discussed because it is neither original nor distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, featuring Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, has been produced "very BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success within its own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or order that the money of the licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Black Friday may be the reason why online sales rose the lowest so far in August
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month, the increase was lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November’s Black Friday could curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade, turning many of Britain’s shopping streets into haunted cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only a 5% increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are levelling off as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened as buyers began to use their mobile phones to shop.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on the couch, for example.
But now it will level off, and (growth) can decrease.
The Black Friday phenomenon has been seen as one of the reasons behind the slowing down of trade.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average shoppers flocked to their computers to grab stores, knocking down the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over the findings, may curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca crane crash, sanctions on Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when a crane collapsed.
Twenty-nine dead were carried in the air across the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when a crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the sacred site, where only a few days ago a crane fell through the mosque's roof and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family construction group was guilty of the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
Twenty-nine bodies of worshippers killed by cranes who fell in the Grand Mosque of Mecca were carried across the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, a father of four, from the Manchester area, on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic-language version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the directors of the company have been forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to investigate what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage to be held later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards, and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Grand Mosque of Mecca, which are part of a huge building heist run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi dynasty for decades, leading major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every able Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead as well as to the permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap working men are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint brushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do home refurbishment work
It seems that if you’re clever with a hammer or hack to paint walls, you’re in the minority these days.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do their own work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind the B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a home renovation store chain, said that the popularity lies in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Workman Screwfix stores and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in the store are made by the fair sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households that do more home refurbishment work than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff at our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK’s most important companies in the FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with an equal number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is the only company with exactly 50 percent of women in the group, including its CEO and Chief Financial Officer.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the leadership team."
Kingfisher announced a decline in both six-month returns and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The government of the three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other central employees’ organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad demonstration by the workers.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Let's ask if it's worth the strike when things are going bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been set up.
More than 50,000 people online have already announced that they are not going to participate in the demonstration and are going to work.
In the good old days, that would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but to openly declare a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members is not much of a moment, but it is something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement’s operations, the government’s violent solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
Since things have seemed to be rolling on their own for years, the unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers’ rights, clearly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps more necessary than before.
No matter what they think, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped long ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta to achieve savings of 8.5 million, personnel to be cut by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings course, which aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the University will initiate co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means that about 130 employees will be cut.
An additional two million will be saved.
The basis for the negotiations is the 2016 budget, which predicts that the actual operations will be in deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by cuts in the budget made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will make a deficit of approximately 2.6 million.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will be reduced by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is approximately 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding is visible in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will start next week on Tuesday and will last for six weeks, as stipulated by the law.
Onnibus wants to go to the Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail traffic.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK,” Souter said.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there will be long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
At least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe, has reported interest in rail transport from other international companies.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates.
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
As Reuters polled 80 economists, just over half of those who last week believed the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are kept at the current 0-0.25% level.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheets and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they need to be ready for a draw, but the signs also show that they believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apology Message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting his colleagues later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was "worsen" about the first murder and hoped "that she could cancel it," officials said Tuesday.
Gautier Police in Mississippi reported that Delta State University Geography and Social Sciences teacher Lamb called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone", but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not say it.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note by 45-year-old Lamb were found saying, "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University Rector William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
Officials said on Tuesday that despite allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was having an affair with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind of "triangular drama".
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O’Steen said Prentiss and his daughter were “best friends.”
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it there and went running into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb defended her doctoral thesis on education at Delta State in spring 2015, says a CV found on the university website.
The stars who lost their charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a tough time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture on his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
He comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least six months, and he won't play in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received only a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was mistaken.
You can condemn the situation when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Manchester United suffers Luke Shaw case and loses to PSV
The British defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player is forced out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
The aim of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not meant to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I didn’t see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno told SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than that, don't he?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by the holiday childcare service about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, an environmentalist story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron wrote in a post posted on SuperCamps’ website and continues, “Funny, moving, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we haven’t seen before.”
All this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added as a rather short original text.
"In a city within the walls of Neville, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream girl by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds in places like it was taken from a plot summary of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins with the following: "In the city of Neville, within the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream Audrey girl on his side."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, wood-cutting and weavering Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustache creature Lorax who "speaks for the trees" who gave the story a name.
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said that the text must have come from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of leaving the England team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think a repeat of the 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than a team from three years ago, but it has good tourners and the team's mindset is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral pitches and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
"The decision to leave Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against strikers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice makers.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, a second chance will come.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform quite as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a hitter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has something about him as a cricketer that we in Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in the batting opening at Cook's side has been played, so we could get an extra pitcher on the field but keep four fast, and I'm not against this.
“I don’t understand why a hitter can’t hit there, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen did not necessarily perform his mission in his county of Worcestershire, but he is number three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games with the first lattice dropped, before moving to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored 300 points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, with the little I've been dealing with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unembellished stats — batting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 — and think it’s a gamble, but there aren’t too many pitchers available and the selectors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a genius.
He’s one of the nicest guys in the game and brings a huge amount of experience because he’s done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball game, bringing both energy and a relentless hint.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it’s playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of wit to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in one-days, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and picks don’t make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favour of the UK leaving the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU face increasing problems every day, even without even taking into account the cordial Jeremy "Is it a yes or no?" Corbyn's election to lead the Labour Party or the anger of the trade union federation over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deep in different crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the self-centered British agenda, which is filled with discordant concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they were undermining social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye-catching one, and then come home saying that they will win supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward inside the UK's EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say, from Berlin - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before it gets ruined in the same way that happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for selfiebrits, when their energy would rather be directed to preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the Scottish National Party style during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was an arranged thing" and "The renegotiation was of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street newspaper can be and how EU skeptical the press monarchs are, which was not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about "EU straight bananas" while being Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-absorbing crooks, foreigners who hack their phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt exactly the same way about them, but realized that if you are in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the distraction, unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Mr Miliband was more Blairian than Mr Blair himself when it came to opposing Mr Cameron's renegotiation act, because Mr Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Mr Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster House of Parliament on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of reinstating Neil Kinnock's '80s boycotted Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
While it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside of the UK Independence Party's Ukip's war goal passion as well as the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and television this week when her internal scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his paternal grandfather struggled on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight to keep up with "anywhere" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor from everything Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s basic twisting of EU membership (and aligned with their Benn-minded regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-understand debate among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), the foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they, too, have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it may be in vain?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's e-cigarette review
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released this " landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "extraordinaryly sluggish bottom" of PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have wondered if the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say, "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "to date, according to the best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on harm associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive is reported to have previously received funding for research independent of Bristish American Tobacco.
He also supported BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The criteria for the selection of panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that the study has received funding from the sector.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco at PHE.
The study produced by the group "muchly admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding harm in most of the products and in most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said the claims made in the BMJ had been answered in the past.
He says, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion each year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for hits such as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes likely to have a smaller audience on difficult broadcast times against the most watched programmes of competitors and on such channels as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried to build a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC is producing and broadcasting programs that would be clearly suited to unsubsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is broadcast at the most important time of the broadcast because they want to gather as much support for its future as possible.
The idea that no one else is showing the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly implemented within the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Series entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He comments on the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of comments by former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience public service programs "go to BBC4, where often it is not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then, when defending £4 billion in licence fee revenues, hypocritically state that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that nobody is watching'".
They put them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the permit fee, Johnson told the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is a big money because they don't spend much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its early mission of Reith "to inform, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% TV production and 0.1% radio - and that it should take the lead from Australian and Canadian broadcasts and turn the task into "information, education and entertainment".
Regarding partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says will only be shown on television to a few, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these can be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cell control through sound waves
The video shows how shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically engineered neural systems so that they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Scientists are reading and writing brain activity with light
The researchers said that worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are introduced into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttles normally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified the ultrasound waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open up and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they turn on the modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along the optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus may make it possible to make the target human nerve cells respond momentarily to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Banned by Britain’s arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms show video.
Horrible killer machines!
Ankle-crushing legcuffs!
Cluster bombs!
As well as electric stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and imagery of the comics leaves no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive governments at a party held at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in the London shipyard area.

With a separate campaign, many posters appeared at bus stops and metro trains, which require a closer look.
"Important announcement, Are you traveling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" together asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR's track turned into a tank image.
This September, a group of arms dealers arrive on the DLR route...customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were on display at the Museum of Cruel Designs (Museum of Cruel Plans) in Banksyn Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This is a six-pound pack of hex keys, which, according to the collective, "accesses a third of the advertising space for bus stops on the entire planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "poster vandalism".
One of the parody advertisements produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer of the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in the resistance chests when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International’s video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours. It was created for free by VCCP, an advertising agency, and the graphic designer and background reviewer also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that gun fairs were not advertised at all - and there was also a blank spot on ExCeL's calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but "it was more stoppable to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation".
"They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the British Government must take action to ensure that instruments of torture are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fair comes from within ExCeL, as exhibitors sell fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in a press release that he had received an order from the U.S. Army for a "shoulder-launched AT4CS RS".
This includes a "unique tube bet warhead that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dorm
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student dorm at the age of 19, when I believed in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve to completely scary.
It’s tempting to babble: tell me where you’re from, if you had a year off and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why “I don’t really love or hate Marmite because it’s really just a yeast extract HAHAHA finds me in my room.”
Take a breath.
And also help others to take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, rather than the ones you don’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they’re handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and general entertainment places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting college when you’re in a relationship.
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when there was a speech: knock.
One guy in my dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you start college in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cake plate and self-presentation seems somewhat less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Offering self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and it may be that in the future they will associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-fat lumps are likely to cause people to just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they are boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to take it more adult than my dorm friend who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You should not make such noise that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot scolding a pot.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locking her door, and going on a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your dorm partner as your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your common friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot dorm partner isn’t really your future spouse, you could at least try talking some sense into your downside.
In that exhilarating moment when you discover that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be canceled in no time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson in safety by hiding something — but never mess up someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not fasten their property with a blue sticker on the ceiling until no more than twice.
Racist attack on foreign students’ accommodation in Kitee - The planned reception centre house was tarnished in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on the residence of foreign students in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers but sleeping quarters for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukainen, teacher at Kiteen Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities of the Folk High School were tarnished with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodation windows, the police in Eastern Finland said.
According to Luukkainen, who is the responsible teacher of the youth guarantee education at Kansanopisto, an estimated ten people were in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere,” Luukainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed in the folk high school.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the cluttered building has a "A" status.
Some are studying in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish,” Luukkainen says.
A-status is a permanent residence permit that can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held on Monday for the students, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had over a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” Luukainen says.
According to the lock, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men and had been in a light-colored car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend evening when this topic has now been on the surface.
“Nothing more serious,” he said.
There is also a hospital in Salo that is planned to have a reception centre.
The incident occurred last week.
This was announced on MTV’s website on Tuesday.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written "You are not welcome" in English.
A crime has been reported to the police.

The state is shutting down the Y-train to Karjaa - the passengers are pissed, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raseborg’s Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers arriving at the Helsinki Central Station in the early evening of the train in question.
In particular, the people of Siuntio are hit by the downfall, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can depend on nothing but political will - or lack of it.
Bengtström says in an interview video for HSTV that he will come to the capital in a tractor, for example.
There are also train changes in other parts of the country.
The main line H and R trains will be merged into a new R line.
Purola’s station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase rail services during the next agreement period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in the autumn, will be approved by the Committee on Finance.
Siuntio-based Bengtström considers that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-Raseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those travelling further away from the urban area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their trip," he said as he climbed on the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the railway line, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring additional costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to examine the different options and their impact on the service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is not yet possible to accurately estimate the cost.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y-train, but the Ministry of Finance has of course paid much more than this.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
Instead, in Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase rail services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year will be made on the routes to be discontinued, compared to approximately nine million trips in the transport purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is expected to bring the state $12.3 million in annual savings.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's topicality: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes George Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland, in the book The Currentity of Marx Capital, published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization and penetration of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University professor, respected economics expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
However, the former Director General of the Institute of Economic Research and the Delegation of the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist, is he?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not view Marx as a topical economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, a world that is changing as a result of technological upheaval,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not going to help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
However, Marx is worth looking at.
“In the 1970s, Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more so each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx's mindset - like other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls on war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The United Nations has called for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, according to the AFP news agency.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and insurgents known as Tamil tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The number of victims is not known.
In particular, the large-scale attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
Sri Lankan armed forces are accused of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combatants.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it plans to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the creation of a UN court due to foreign judges.
England’s YO test allowed social media to be considered
On Wednesday, the matriculation examination took place in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 candidates tested their English skills.
You could write an essay on social media.
From our own experiences, we had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250-word essay could be addressed to the administrator of the advice column of the online magazine.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He had to ask for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
There were four subjects in total, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them," assessed Mia Lybeck, English lecturer at Porvoo's Swedish-speaking high school.
The third item was just a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire experiment as "pretty normal."
In the English test in Finnish - or Swedish - you were able to answer questions about texts that included, for example, the adaptation of zucchini to climate change and the processing of large amounts of information.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn’s writings will continue on Friday, when there will be a test of another domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish.
In upper secondary schools, the exam is held normally, which means that the employees’ demonstration does not affect it.
The Student Examination Board advises candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the test event.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Kello district was robbed in Oulu.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commandand hat covering his face.
He has a normal body and is about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a serious robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government’s cuts will block downtown Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, tens of thousands of people may arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11.00 a.m.
Police are also expected to take part in the demonstration.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to take care of the alarm tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the massive demonstration takes place.
Roads leading to the railway square will be closed to motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Traffic from the Hakaniemi direction will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the west direction.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, that seems to be enough.
I do not take a stand on industrial action by the police.
According to Kujala, support patrols from elsewhere in Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police will not tell you the exact number of patrols.
“Something is coming, but as a rule we can manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urged to avoid private driving in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected until early in the morning.
With protesters arriving from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki is also home to a large number of charter buses.
They are not allowed in the railway station.
Buses are generally far away.
The rest of the way must then walk to the demonstration site,” Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of on its own.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are either ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in various parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good comparison point in Finnish political history,” says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiäinen of the University of Jyväskylä.
It’s no wonder the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of things to do with the fact that the trade union movement is actually trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all employees for the demonstrations on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about in the group that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a break-and-break Thursday in 1993, Siisiäinen says.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Breaking Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Aho (center) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as under the bourgeois government in Aho.
Now, relations between the government and the trade union movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of the break-in.
In addition, Finland’s most bourgeois government will ever be in power, Siisiäinen says.
The current coalition of government is still so interesting that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to be there on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish trade union movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, and we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisäinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstrations has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and Electrical Strikes in the 1970s
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Reconciliation Board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men received a 16% raise in wages.
The spring of 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Breaking and Breaking in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people gathered in front of the House of Parliament, many of them made unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were hit by egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, the EU quits," was one of the slogans.
In Spain, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also prompted farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting site.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass dismissal of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually brought the negotiations to an end.
Doctors on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forcibly," was the slogan of strikers in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector increased the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favor of student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation finds out the background of a Finnish truck filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police in Aisterheim, near the German border, stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
All of the people in the cold truck were in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE), which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company engages in restaurant business, among other things, and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier and a rich businessman: the story of five smugglers
A rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a classy missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book Death's Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the tentacles of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from different stages of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of their heads right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
In terms of their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more productive for the fisherman to transport people.
This is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-meter wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients all over Tunisia for him.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis erupted again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will put them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers can barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
We're going out at midnight with lanterns turned off.
On the first night you drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on his return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least claims he's going to beat the shit out of them.
He says in the book that when the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers by the neck one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's going to have to beat his countrymen for this.
I'll beat them out of their heads right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is running its last and in any case it has seen its best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 km southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, which is mainly open to families.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families are accommodated in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
Arriving in the Bogovaða region, a major hub of human smuggling, people are dying tired.
The Goran riders are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says Africans are trying to compromise.
That's not what Goran likes.
Stupid fool all the way.
First, the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about three hundred kilometers away, most of it comfortable on the freeway.
They say they're asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is quite a nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered taxis not to be allowed to transport migrants closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about that: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and squeals away.
In the work of mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is home to a large number of refugees from the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and onward to Europe.
The client will first call one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worthwhile to arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money snugly, and slip in among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to be eligible for asylum or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from war zones such as North Kivu and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will provide the client with a new identity.
The old ID will be destroyed and replaced.
That's where the Missionary contacts with Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, non-governmental organisations, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the process of moving to a European country, for example, 4 500-7,000 euros.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, an ex-drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on call off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks bound for Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near downtown Calais.
They drive the A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been doing seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the freeway to a rest place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the channel to the British.
Tom chooses the right truck... to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example... and cuts off the safety wire on the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but it is more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not sneer at the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human traffickers in the world.
The Upporian Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, which dominates sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and is constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented out yachts to take American or European families on comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who, for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, are first transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once it's delivered, we'll have to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 after the cost of one luxury boat trip.
He does not take care of the practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are arranged and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred homes through cover companies, which he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of parliament of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

The American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in her book Fast Girl, talks about ending her career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the Games in top condition and ran in qualifying for the second best time.
In the final, he panicked.
He rushed to the top at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the goal, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was overtaken one after another by other competitors.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
“I forced myself over the finish line,” Favor Hamilton said in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he yearned for adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was world number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Finals.
World champion rejoiced when union put Norwegian ski rooster under control: "Straightback"
Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the athlete’s contract throughout the summer and autumn of last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
Following his contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski cock under control.
"Thank you for pointing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug announced that he would like to play in the Norwegian colours next season at the World Cup and then at the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two gold ones.
He was part of the team that won the relay gold at Falun last winter.
Roast translators’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. 25.9. there will be events in different restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Roast Translators’ Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, and to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as a part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but the top restaurants inspected and classified by an independent operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as a part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant will take part in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events of the organisation, which will take place on the same day around the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of Kauhava reception centre was filed with the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are in co-operation to establish a refugee reception centre in Kauhava’s former garrison facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure during the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkko Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Air Force Academy, the impact of which has also not been investigated in preparation for the reception centre.
For the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy of the Ministry of Defence.
A private person tells the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of opposition in principle to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially at a time when we are facing great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
He is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If the situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The issue of NATO was also discussed.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, starts closing for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that the operations of the airports will be handled by supervisors during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checks and other service points.
Protest closes the streets of central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say that the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars around 9.30-14.
Cars from the Mannerheimintie direction are not allowed on Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic will be directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
Subway and tram drivers at all Friday’s demonstrations
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday’s demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Tram and Metro Association told STT about it last night.
Most of the beginnings will be closed for two hours, even when the mails are closed.
Friday’s protest will also cause disruptions to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross's blood transports will be handled despite the strike.
Meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples will also be handled.
Situational information on the services is available on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Alkos will close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The services union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to take part in a trade union demonstration.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with superiors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki Daycare Centres Partly Closed
The daycare centres in Helsinki will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to the demonstration by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day-care centres, and club activities at day-care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multi-disabled children remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to inform more about the changes tomorrow.
Media Researcher: Takes a Big Risk
According to Sipilä, communications need diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one of the other channels.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, he told reporters.
Sipilä did not yet want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be communicated on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as channels, then we'll see.
We are going to use this channel tonight,” he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires the public to speak on television and radio.
This whole issue, which we are talking about here, is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That’s why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21:05-21:20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
The horse takes a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not be about a more general government inward turn.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more firmly into your own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the interests of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media didn't respond.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcement issues in a democracy.
The task of media representatives is, by definition, to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken into account.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more to offer today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, in a different way, or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one has to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Yle also takes risks in this sense, if this is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a means of communication between politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or in general policy.
A clever bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should take a close look at what Sipilä is and isn’t doing,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, because this way he can express his own views without any gravel noises.
This will get the message to the general public without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because it is not possible to ask specific questions.
According to Kuuti, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether the sweat drains, whether the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you can put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform something, because it is here that a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his colleagues do regularly.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to be exceptional for the citizens.
He said it has not happened in decades for the Prime Minister to speak directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that are ahead.
Workers’ organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against the government’s actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a notification by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) says he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can’t hide from the endless,” Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
The boy was fine when he was found.
The boy has been found, and while the boy’s father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
He went out to play at 4 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who have helped in the search.
Thank you for the tens of contacts and observations over the course of these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed in young people’s violent fad: You create hatred
A video posted by Kurdish mixed martial artist Makwan Amirkhani on Facebook that specifically appeals to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a strong speech against the street fighting of young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland at the age of five with his family, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of MMAs.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos of young people fighting with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed in the youth fad.
26-year-old Amirkhani has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the people on the ground, sit on top of the other and hit the other without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos like this.
Hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It's just that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku points out.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come up with a great deal.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a while.
That’s a different way of thanking you for being here,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get hit by someone’s racism, you have to blame yourself.
Now think a couple of times before you go along with something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent activities contribute to racism.
You're making me hate something I don't like.
You’re going to have a pretty bad time anyway, and you’re not going to improve them at all,” Amirkhani says.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employees’ association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
The Chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
The chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, said this on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
Sipilä previously broke the negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the five per cent productivity leap target.
Next Next post: “It’s a bit weird to beat a fist”
It feels a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmosphere varies from one side to the other in the employee camp.
Is the government going to be overturned, or is it going to be settled?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK poured out holy hatred against the government of the republic.
The whole country was threatened.
The threat spread to the Akavas as well.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, STTK’s chairman Antti Palola (sd) made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity leap called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava’s chairman Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his settlement paper was already ready.
At first there was no noise from the office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, SAK would have to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations with Sipilä’s government.
Palola’s right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Influence at STTK, previously served as special assistant to Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola said that the government’s trade union expertise has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a little bit of life away from the Finnish solstice, whose frontman is Marko Piirainen (sd) of ACP.
It's a little weird to shake your fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, said Mongolia is a better host for the OSCE than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July jubilee meeting in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been placed on the European Union's sanctions list to arrive at the meeting - an issue that the President was able to remind journalists about.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again,” Naryshkin said, according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where he was also blocked from entering.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation was able to reach Mongolia without complications, so Naryshkin continued to pick up Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should have no obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is chairing the meeting in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock meets a real playoff troll: "Goals tight"
Today, Tappara and the Clave continue their bull days in Hakametsä, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual goal party in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday he went to Kuopio to drill for a 3-2 continuation win over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Tuesday was much more minor.
The Blues, who started off in a tangled manner, had a round score of zero, and a loss score of 2-3.
Hard play, goals tight, if they play the same game as last year, Lock-back Janne Lahti anticipates still lifes on the club’s website.
It has become quite a playoff nightmare.
In the last two seasons, he has just finished in the finals.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match was required.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three sides and passed.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the compositions of the groups.
The cashiers who both rejected yesterday get a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lukko poles.
Point of view: The worst play going on in ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the Rocky film, in which he himself played the lead.
The underdog sensationally battled heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
The nameless and wood-handed pot pack advanced to the 2006 Finnish Championship Finals to everyone's surprise.
The team was full of anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Pori's Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
She became a blonde.
A great TV commentator, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of the Aces has built a potaka on the basis of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been punching guys in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than discus play.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead actor in Rocky, written by Toivola, as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates hard play, but it's one thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, Aessien Garret Stafford tackled Tappara Jere Karjalainen in the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not approve of such a game and it does not belong to ace puck, the hot Iron Rock snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
This season’s team is strangely built.
There's trains, there's veterans, there's cops, there's bulldozers.
There are practically no key players in the best age of play.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence your player acquisition, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have an impact on procurements and unfortunately the market situation was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts will end in the spring.
Aces' balance in the three league games of the season has an equal number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan should not have written a sequel.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under her husband’s guidance.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to former Apulanna bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka’s direction for the first time.
Olga’s role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, about the early years of Apulanta, is the drummer Sipe Santapuk’s mother, Sirkka.
Cricket cheers and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true role model, the easier it seems.
He’s a great guy and I’m grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They met, talked on the phone, and texted.
Cricket has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles of their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulana would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and it was really dreary.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuukka from her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, then how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's notorious skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuukka.
At the most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a large joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iitti often plans to drive home for the night because the distance is not too long.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to clear them.
Iron Sky 2 becomes Finland’s most expensive film
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the science-fiction film Iron Sky: The Coming Race will become the most expensive drama film ever made in Finland with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is currently under construction, will also go past Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will leave for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I have been so sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It’s great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told Evening Magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big story.
However, you could stuff 100 million into the movie, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no looseness at all.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Is it hillbilly or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ breasts have recently been decorated with large logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen as somewhat of a hillbilly.
But times are changing.
Sport has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so many times before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. conventional fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, we put on the shirt buried at the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas’ recognizable stripe shirts, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to show off the logos in your dress?
Russian politician says he didn’t get stuck in tank hatch for hours
According to the allegations, a peculiar incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to showcase Russian war industry products.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Services had to remove the large Zotovi from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page where he appears to be peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a pretty good mood and, at least from their pictures, it’s not about getting stuck or angry.
It's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I certainly didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
For the Russian military TV channel Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia in the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks,” Zotov said.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
“I’m tall and rough, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank happened,” he told Russskaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged jam have been released, although a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck originally started with a Bloknot.ru case where Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch while trying and threatened to eventually shoot everyone around him unless he got out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organizers of the exhibition gave their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours,” said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings sink into the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The basin contains neutralised tailings and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually the water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, according to the permit, passed through the surface drain field to the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The leak was detected during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been observed to cause structural damage to dam structures in the basin.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against over-cutting
Finland’s country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are slight differences.
There is a lot of message in the IMF's assessment that is sympathetic to government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to achieve 0.4% growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth this year to be zero in its new economic forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been based on the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
On the other hand, less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the difference is only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo Recovering from Death Appoints New Leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start his job on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata’s footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo into mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognized that hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing every year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors are missing every year, according to reports from SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same situation in Finland?
In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications for minors who have come alone were submitted in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were submitted and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were closed due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors who have come alone.
There are no total statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers missing this year, but the number of minors is therefore known and it has increased clearly, which is likely to have an impact on the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have been converted?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the "black job market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of decisions on deportation,” Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action on this.
Orpo, who was considering refugee issues at the EU Home Affairs Council meeting on Monday, told about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who has lost his working ability due to illness, for TV and radio productions is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net that were once one of the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online advert was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, a large part of the equipment is left at the feet of technological progress.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen, however, is confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move away from his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all that stuff with us.
I’ve slowly started to inventory and see what things are being given up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for radio and television equipment.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up a box of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend force action in connection with Friday's protest.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the demonstration on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the oud is big on the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift allowances badly hurt drivers, so there is opposition to the government's plans to cut the allowances.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area will be almost completely at a standstill.
According to VR, the trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. are driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP members will be absent from work from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by supervisors, says Pirkko Repo, a spokesperson for HSL.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services run on Friday.
Workers’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim Boy Arrested at Texas School After A Teacher Thought A Self-Made Clock Was a Bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought a self-made watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never claimed anything but that he had made a clock.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, police had stated that the watch looked like a "film bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but was reportedly composed of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohammed was sentenced to three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the people, Labour MP Kate Green said in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green felt Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn is scheduled to appear in parliament as party leader for the first time today during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn’s election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, economic security and the security of our families.
Minnesota's family's cause still unclear, family's father facing lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family shooting in Greenwood, Minnesota.
A family of five were found dead in their home on 10 September and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of the children at school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead across the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Dollars and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In an interview with StarTribune in 2014, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 offers from the company in the last 10 years.
I have abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
In 2011, the Short family bought a house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Case pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
She had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various preparation courses, for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments defamatory of preparation courses had been removed from Short's site, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri served cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award in the race event.
This is great, Loiri comments with good humor on her board of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned €100,000.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the success horse coach Korpi gets full peace of work when working with the horse.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll shut up, Loiri.
The NHL star’s “biggest donation ever made by an athlete”
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
It is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens.
Subban’s donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
In the past, the players of the Canadiens have made a significant contribution to local hospitals.
The long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife at the Japanese cafe for the evening - only bikinis and a apron are served.
Coffee shops are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, rabbit cafe, vampire cafe, hug cafe and now a wife café on the market.
It strikes the lonely, the sore and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.

The website provides all the information on the height and weight of the candidates for wives, ranging from the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against the security of cars began to be prepared
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry,” Intel said in a statement.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing safety tests and audits to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” Chris Young, Intel Security Director, said in a statement.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major component in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford’s Focus RS has been waiting for years to come.
The car is finally in sight in Finland.
Ford announced RS data at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine, Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 km/h.
In Finnish terms, the price is also interesting, initially it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available to order, although the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia presented two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
More important than in Finland, the new fourth generation Sportage is sure to be the most important of the two innovations, which Kia intends to use to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of European Design Director Gregory Guillaume, Sportage is more round than before.
The wheelbase and outer dimensions have become one centimetre here and the car cuts through the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be announced closer to the sale.
We will have to wait a little longer for that, as the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in Finland.
It doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia plans to win the hearts of upper-middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Initially, Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines will be introduced.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the Optima farmer will start to sell.
Chisu returns to the stage, wearing a bold overall
Singer Chisu is present at the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue panty suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the graceful waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned by a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year hiatus, the singer, who became a mother, has been able to lose weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really make me nervous.
I’ve missed all the music, the singer said.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release their fourth album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album.
Kim Kardashian’s motherhood style is amazing again
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after another.
She shows off her gestational stomach and chest outfit in generously sexy clothes, the last time last night at one o'clock American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left a show with husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress as the lightning lights flicker.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last Friday, when the presentation was scheduled for a pregnancy.
The Tough Laws of Modeling: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Horrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to straighten out the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues speak their minds about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you were posing in top designer outfits the previous season, the new season will begin again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with seniors.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The job is a continuous journey and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you’re very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
It's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to lose pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a risk.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion week ends, the difference will be sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks work is just an introduction to clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors who have a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York City is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I’m about to be a 26-year-old rapper, and in this movie I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar person in this group, so I think it’s good that I only learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to impersonate people.
The man directing Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs will not play the role.
Punk mangers come with a man naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I’m sure many people saw a taste of it, as well if they’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, we always go full-blown.
Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta between 1993 and 2004, directed the film You Make Us Beautiful. The main actors were announced today.
The core group that has become familiar to the band's audience is presented to the general public by relatively unknown young actors.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo by bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job as early as last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge posted a photo of his new look on Instagram that he had to make for the movie.
Scrooge, previously seen on mustaches and chin beards, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell their children about the situation of refugees who are going to Europe.
Or is it worth talking about at all?
There is no need to force the matter to be discussed, says psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the Finnish Social Democratic Party’s crisis group.
Younger children should be protected, for example, not let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is a good idea to discuss the starting point of the child and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
Children’s fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
There is no need to scare a child in vain, even if you are distressed and afraid.
Younger children follow their parents’ behavior closely.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child feels safe too.
Older children will likely come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is a good idea for parents to discuss the matter with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how this will be felt in our family.
After all, is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family is also talking about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come with life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker”
Your strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
It's hard to control ball lightning that hits Vermo
Perttu Pohjola was able to refine Cpila’s Ballsalam into a blast in the middle of the summer.
It was only a win and a second place until the end of July when the race in Tampere came to a collapse.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with his protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the vantage point.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medication to overcome it.
Since Clover’s Pallosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says she was positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE mare in its record time in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Cpila’s Ballbolt was under a lot of pressure from the break, as it had only been possible to drive normally for a few weeks.
Considering these things, the slight bending at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good competition made the stallion sharp.
The horse's tone was definitely moving forward, and hopefully it would have stabilized as well.
The ball has been called humorous horses.
When it's not fun, it can be thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have lost such lightning tension that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors are no match for the Ballbolt, which can even detach warm-blooded rides.
The hope of the North is in Vermo.
However, the difference is how the ball will do it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure, and you might even be snuggling under the boom of the starting car and all that.
Hopefully it will be calmer than going down.
Cpila’s Ballbolt is able to come from the front as well, and we’re going to drive it for the win, the coach promises.
This Is Why You Can't Get Rid of Unnecessary iPhone Programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the software that comes with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future — but not quite all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, said Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook said removing Apple’s programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on your iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps worked closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue because the company does not want to waste memory space on iPhones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat, the European Statistical Authority.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% slightly downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called core inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimate of underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 EU countries was zero in August.
In July, there was an increase of 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most by 1.4 per cent in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest, with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU’s harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2% price increases over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area at an average of 0.1% this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1 per cent, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts published at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the Fed starts raising its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested that it will start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession may be at its fastest by next autumn, and the pace of the financial markets before it.
Or at least that’s what happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets operate as they used to, and if they react to the blackmail of the Fed’s money taps as they did in the past.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international clients last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market after that.
Instead, using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed interest rate hikes.
In addition to historical findings, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates increases — and what might follow.
It becomes clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more fragile state to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
The recession may not start for a year.
Throughout last summer and early autumn, leaders who decide on the Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have hinted that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years could occur this week.
The matter will be resolved in the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed Board’s so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter in its two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its so-called Fed funds interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rate increases of 0.25 percentage points, which lasted for exactly two years, increased the Fed’s interest rate from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
The last time serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy started more slowly than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harsher than at any time since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turnarounds in financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact are reported since the 1950s.
Less than a year has passed since the start of the recession at its fastest time since the first interest rate increase, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, the Fed has taken turns raising and lowering its policy rate by a dozen cycles of different dimensions.
Each time has differed in some respects from the others, and the narrator is considered relatively sparse, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the subsequent interest rate increases.
This time, the strategy reminds us that many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, are not necessarily identified, even by decades of research.
But three of the causes of the crisis and its destructive effects must be somewhat clear:
In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB, and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno-bubble, while growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amount of debt in different parts of the financial and real economy grew even more due to the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in history.
(3) In particular, the crazily cheap debt financing packed into the financial economy, almost without restraint, inflated the largest exchange bubbles in the history of the financial markets, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities, in most sectors of the financial market.
Again, there is hardly any serious controversy that, on the basis of ever more complex leverages, the high-level financial markets were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures armed with debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last until their time after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give some thought to such things as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been crazy for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper at its cheapest than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in different parts of the economy there is a much heavier debt burden than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
(3) Liquidity in circulation from central banks, which has become more abundant and cheaper than ever, has largely remained on financial markets and has cost the most of key securities and assets, whether at the peak before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do strategists use the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades, as it has done in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but correspondingly the pressures and risks on the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next sets out to tighten its money taps.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Societe Generale’s strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time been coaching international investor clients of the bank for the following turnarounds of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to cut 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions will be made to HP’s business services side, the company says.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PC machines and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have 25,000 to 30,000 employees cut.
The consumer side's reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
As recently as last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System for iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, your phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some people have experienced problems since this installation when an "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to obtain status, but Apple has reduced the possibility of this by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests applications to remove and then reinstalls them when the update is completed.
You should make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won’t let the update go because if the battery runs out, it could cause the update to break.

It’s also worth making sure you’ve gone through our list of all the things you need to do before you download, so things don’t go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they do anyway. iOS 9 brings new features like a much smarter personal assistant and a huge amount of new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and fix your operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (center) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, for which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a board member.
Berner himself says he has filed a resignation notice for membership in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, says Berner in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs Board of Directors and in a Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings go through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg-based company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the benefits of the Finnish family-owned company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that the income of Finnish companies is taxed in Finland, and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre operated by a company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to accommodate the first 100 residents as early as 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is particularly the provision of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on the security arrangements of the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative blackmail package for working life
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package for the government’s working life blackmail.
The organization also wants to include other central employers’ organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the focus is on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the price of labour will then return.
“Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday,” Palola told reporters during a break in the organization’s administration meeting.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK’s economists have calculated that the change security included in the Government’s Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don’t know if there is a great deal of enthusiasm for a debate if you have a one-to-a-hundred ratio.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not take a position as to whether the schedule is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, the cut in Sunday allowances, in particular, is a painful place for the staff organisation STTK’s field.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it is implementing some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, STTK does not want to warm up to the fact that the alternative package is being prepared with the SDP that has been on the agenda.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, salaries for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday compensation will be reduced to 75% and holidays will be shortened.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to the demonstration, and the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Akava’s chairman, Sture Fjäder, commends STTK’s announcement that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming into line with Akava, as an alternative model for government proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava’s chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that Lauri Lyly will join SAK in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a five per cent competitive leap for the government as an alternative to the cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Sture Fjäder, Chairman.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together on a model that is suitable for the government and employers of the country,” Fjäder says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
University of Tampere Green Left Viva bingo coupon for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä Rebellion and Wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on YLE channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister’s previous speech, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio address, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen put an end to the strike of train performers with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchy
All day long, the speech has sparked criticism and conjecture about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, chairman of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, "the monologue has already been seen.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) condemned on Facebook that "monarchist attitude: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for him".
Antti Rinne, chair of the Social Democratic Party, challenged Sipilä to the dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhaasipila afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
He has been criticized for his speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service’s mission to promote publicity throughout Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications at Yle News.
Just like we did in the Tammels.
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When the evening comes, the dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom wears a pretty coat and my dad fits a tie around his neck.
At 9 a.m., let’s sit down in front of the TV like we used to in Tammela,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government sits in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that it is necessary to cut back when the state has run out of money?” asks Pia Lohikoski.
As for what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a related bingo on Facebook.
Will we hear tonight about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia’s proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to dissuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations proposed a plan for Assad to step down in style after some time.
However, the Western nations did not accept the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall within a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria with five permanent members of the UN Security Council in 2012.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin enumerated a three-point plan for him in a bilateral discussion: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and Assad had to be contacted immediately and al-Assad’s renunciation of power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he sent Tshurkin’s message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion for the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, as his experience suggests that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow authorization.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
Jenkins said he suspected it was Putin’s trick of holding power with someone who supported Assad.
The flow of refugees from our own actions
During the negotiations with Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN, the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves,” Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The Asylum Seekers ’ Organizer Centre
The asylum seekers’ arrangement centre, planned by the government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the empty Tornio joint building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the City Council of Tornio, Sauli Hyöppinen (left) this is not true.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
There were 36 out of 43 delegates present at the debate.
The Centre was opposed by 13 councillors.
On the basis of this, one would expect the decision to be positive, says Hyppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted to.
It is estimated that there will be 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too,” Nousiainen says.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Extortion
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of labour sought by the government.
However, the Government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for replacements for government-announced work-life blackmails.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, halving the holiday money would work as a means, because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday allowances.
Labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday payments, as they have been recorded in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will report to Parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work starts then, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more and more difficult.
Now is a good time.
It won’t take long for this to happen, if you have the will.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the conversion of Epiphany and Helatorsä into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are carried out as mandatory legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Workers’ organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of sap hall warehouse
The Council of Tohmajärvi unanimously approved the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s warehouse, or sap hall, with some grumbling.
The reason for the criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than what was originally mentioned.
I also have a busy schedule.
It was also a bit surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
At this stage, the 400-450 m2 warehouse expansion was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
An investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200,000 was still discussed on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its previous strong position to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the preservation of Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in the city centre in Karelia.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing, for example.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be viewed with a broad mind now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be used in a wide range of marketing activities.
Discontinuation of train connections will cut the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections hit the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all, says the Mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen.
He also raises the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the whole region that we do not succeed in reducing the possibilities of government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and the housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
At the moment, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siu's war
The view of the Joensuu City Government on the provincial Siun Sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also present.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the City Board (sd., pictured), proposed at the board meeting on Monday that the whole project should be abandoned, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s proposal for a decision, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one pair of trains.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains are left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail transport purchase money for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely closed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys ran away.
A 12-year-old who climbed to the roof of the building was released by rescue services, who could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs adjacent to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same road, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped away and passers-by alerted the rescue department to help with a pull ladder the last one left on the roof safely back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit doubles, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results from its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to lower demand for freight services and higher costs of its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell approximately 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects the tax year to end next May at $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a factset poll.
The lower outlook came despite an average of 4.9 per cent price increases, which will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges starting in November for heavy or large parcels on land.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is on the rise.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is performing steadily, taking into account weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holiday were announced a day after the contestant UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx’s earnings were $692 million, an increase of 6% from last year.
Profit per share came in at $2.42, which falls short of the $2.44 average forecast. The survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
In a Zacks poll, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered from a decline in international priority transportation, which has halted the development of its Express unit revenue.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground’s results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was in principle the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
The revenue of the Express unit was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx shut down 11 percent for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is sitting two days around a huge mahogany table this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the policy rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must put the nation's financial interests above everything else.
Congress has placed on the central bank a dual responsibility: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
After the Great Depression, however, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that could be a decisive factor in a decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record-breaking incentive that has been brought by short-term interest rates that have remained almost zero since late 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already on alert central bank officials even more alarmed when it comes to increasing instability, fearing what would be the impact of raising the federal funds rate by even a percentage point per quarter.
“Understandingly, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification to leave interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in world markets is valid enough to wait yet," he says.
No agreement has been reached on the central bank’s decision, which is also a source of nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of financial experts predict interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the drawdown, as the key indicator indicates that the chance of growth is only around 30%.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless policymakers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next drawdown will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they will have to put a lot of effort into their policies to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the central bank would be raising interest rates this month by a quarter of a percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite liberals calling for more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, the lowest rate in seven years and close to the level the central bank sees as the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the main reason for this, according to the central bank’s decision-makers, is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "is able to cope with higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight conditions in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief financial expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 16 percent from its May record as investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks of news coverage of China's economic weakness, decision-makers would raise levels at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
He now predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still rather unclear and they have little information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank’s influence has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanke, then president, hinted that the central bank could "narrow" the increase in the amount of money, caused upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "the central bank has in the past overreacted to financial market movements that have appeared to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, these cuts were reversed by the central bank.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during a major crisis, such as when markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Pose, former member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The latest turmoil does not come close to its level, Posen says.
“Nobody wants to be in a situation where there is fear of raising interest rates because the market is annoyed,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability, as long as that is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's Pediatric Society in Rio Grande Promotes a Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Society (SPRS) has come up with a shocking way to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child’s immune system.
Seven Channel's Sunrise program is a favorite in viewership, despite Nine channel's attempts to report a leader exposure on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leader revelation failed to increase Today's ratings.
The Nine channel's morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a series of international broadcasts that lasted that week, also covering Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance ballast did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average viewership was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 in Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven's big news was the 800 Words series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, astoundingly premiered.
The new drama series, which garnered a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the driving force behind the popular show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838 000) and TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) reached 623,000 viewers - which was a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer average was 520,000 viewers, and on the second half-hour the figure was a staggering 720,000.
The average for the Hot Seat was 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia's second night viewer average brings confidence to Nine that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's program.

The final trio agrees with dads that Sam Wood is the perfect guy — but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three became two, however, they could inadvertently give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood is a perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Relations between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of (Sarah's) and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really down to earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said last week's home visit meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the one".
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now with all my heart in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not her, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can tell," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after how this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kick return as the team beat Minnesota on Tuesday by 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next flight kick and included him in the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the locker room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a battalion in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne drops flight kick caught by Minnesota Vikings in first quarter
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told Australian radio pair team Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on frequency 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It's just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed in a photo posted on her Instagram account with fans, holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the country's new constitution proposal, the official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air, before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group claimed its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted this week on the clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter should be approved by Sunday.
U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC Says South of Cape Verde Has 60 Percent Chance of a Hurricane
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verdean island group, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another precisely bounded low-pressure front, located midway between the Cape Verdean group of islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google Launches Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees from Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by the director, his own personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with her family from Kabul at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
Donations are made by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the same amount for every donation made on google.com/refugeerelief worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total goal of $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight Loss Surgery May Help Mildly Obese Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in ways other than surgery.
“It takes a long time to get the mortality data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery specialist who wrote an editorial for the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of subjects in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, the ratio of weight to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If a BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person has a BMI over 30, they are considered obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, with medicinal treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of people cut down from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those who were treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same in 29.
Thirty-six percent of the patients were fully and 28 percent partially cured with diabetes.
In comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin levels of A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
However, this improved “glycemic control” described by improved haemoglobin levels of A1c did not reduce mortality over five years, said Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
By the fifth year, when compared to the group undergoing gastric reduction surgery, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18,7 and 14.2 kg), decreased their BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased their haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 and 2.1%), and were more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 and 16.7%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoelix says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to longer lifespans in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die in a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are nonetheless encouraging for individuals with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group,” he says, and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we are forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate issue is to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused the chain to be violent.
"After 9/11, in a letter, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, the ingestion of hand disinfectant in children has increased fourfold.
Poison data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in ingestion of a heavily alcoholic hand disinfectant in children under the age of 12 since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Centre, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison control centres for children under the age of 12 rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency department," Lopez told CNN.
She said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap high.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed disinfectant with an alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
A pleasant smell of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handdecks) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants can contain anything from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few squirts.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please do not leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but leave the hand disinfectant visible, and if children are interested in it, it is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four squirts of strawberry scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit for adult drunk driving, says Chris Ritchey, an emergency medical clinician who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as he spoke and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontarion women died after ingesting a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "nasty" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from her class.
The police consider the plan to be a "false nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.

I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scottish people like to follow them as well.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to ten-man Aberdeen, who are now at the top of the series with a five-point gap to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton Warns of January Player Transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on the potential targets for the January transfer, he is wary of the most frenzy of recruiting, assuring that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
A former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the entire period prior to the season, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's Interest in Michu Suggests Retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is associated with the transfer window to Celtic, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight Scottish Football Federation over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was already the third red card judged by Collum to be overturned in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by his message, claiming, "I did not question honesty, I did not comment on the performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a whim of the moment," the attacker said, adding, "it may be safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless I then move on to play for Celtic."
Tannadice board believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' deterioration must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes happy for 'ugly win' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, desperately hung around in the game against Hamilton Accies, but thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, managed to achieve his seventh consecutive league win that put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it is a trophy or a league that has not also won games in this way."
Unemployment in Scotland remains the same as the UK's overall figure increases
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than in the UK 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons now stands at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
David Mundell, Scottish Secretary of State, commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of the government is to build the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over the past 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no judicial intervention at all, I will watch a man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Journalists, of course, have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than available seats, participants are selected through a horrendous draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever's chosen is watching the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also made my own connection with him through the months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say that I cannot be both a Witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to carry a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a reporter from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants, and you'll be part of it.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that “I could have put my words better,” but he still thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is at my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to my podcasts.
I am not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aiding.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And this is the point where I see him dying.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police hunt
The Constable of Canning Vale remained dry as he lured the man away from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract police officers from their heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres away from a police officer who was trying to "gentlely lure him back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to an unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "decent police negotiation".
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," senior sergeant Castledine said.
Ben Cousins is a great example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate his teams last year, and threatens to stop racing immediately.
He blames the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatain due to a treatment procedure on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what's best for the competition, and that he's been in a tricky situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check over spy claims for a year and a half, and did not want it to "look like jealousy".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it all erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
“When they start thinking differently, I don’t have to be a coach anymore.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he reported that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — I name him when asked — and offered him a job in my stables if he would convey information about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm an impostor.
If that's the case, of course they'd better fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the issue at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift responsibility beyond what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they’ll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying right now might make them think about that.
But I'm at a point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach's frustration has increased with the long-running Cobalt study of Lidar, and a late rejection led him to conclude that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day management procedures "ridiculous" after a mud or clay bath has been put at the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on his leg.
He could have had a poultice last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
He had it on the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month ban due to race day poultice treatment, from which officials started an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a road escape after colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after being seriously injured when a car collided with him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalisa reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champion favourites that his team tackles are part of "the alignment".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on their own side when they unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after beating the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualifier. Bennett called the game a "show window" of the rugby league and said that the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said that they only focus on "contact" when tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by two leading coach criticisms of Storm, as it means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year. Over the past six weeks we have only stressed contact in tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years and obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, and this was a small shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the St George Illawarra Dragons, coached by Bennett, won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell him how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 that St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought up that side in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby in his style - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I get more confident when they say things like this because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for important games.
Bellamy also remarked that the game between the Storm and the Roosters was more score-rich than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense to break and not score a goal?
For me, this is about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm is off this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-finals at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
US$200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for an attempted possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men arrested last month after federal police traced 100 pounds of drug to a Solay yacht that entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a possible life sentence for attempting to hold a quantity of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in a cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting a $200,000 bail sum is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and upholds his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received numerous obscene photos of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, discovering that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found shocking messages, and then immediately told her mother.
Upon entering, police saw five photos, searched the computers on the scene, and found "concerned" web searches with search terms that had been used to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to lure paedophiles" on the Internet, before he "pretends to be a cop to scare them".
Fiscal Depute Representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court the following: "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had conducted searches on a computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that after drinking, he is sick of the head, and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she was screaming at her mother, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the indecent pictures on the phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of making or taking images of immoral children on June 14 of last year, breaking his bail on January 25 of this year and failing to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered on the sex offenders' register, as it could be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October to give the welfare department time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is detained before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders register before the day of sentencing.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The parliament's opening was also tarnished by opposition lawmakers' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with interludes as he gave a speech to Parliament on the state of the country - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not apply.
The group discipline supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring costs of around $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a standalone company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual revenue will be more than $50 billion and will “focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions” to companies.
The division dissolves the company, which was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated a garage in Palo Alto, called "The Birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and is the latest in a field based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best case, Wilshire will miss at least the next four England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest pity with this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of further injuries when a player tries to return midway through the season.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played 157 of Arsenal's league games in just 65 games over the past five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's wider package since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to an injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in the injury statistics for last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury can be a predisposed period when you have to strengthen your body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the kind of career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to rotate his team as Arsenal starts their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the beginning.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to Group F, Maximiri Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lessons from last season's Champions League surrender against Monaco, and is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given the fact that men’s need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate among young men is higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and is three times more common among men than among women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men's Year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and secondary school-age students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person’s chance of recovery was doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of their friends were “in good health”.
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half as likely to develop mental health problems if they had mentally sound friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this age of communication through social media, style passes the content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful, and successful when in reality isolation reigns.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this happens at the expense of internal values - the inner longing for personal growth and friendship - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t get any greater happiness.
The beauty of friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..."Listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have truly understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Men who contact us often feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping options.
It was about the little moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, outside position on the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate the party, why not take your friends for coffee in Central Perk?
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates goals with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in his Champions League debut, showing the way for the French league champions, but the team missed several opportunities before finally adding their lead as Cavan struck a goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who is in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a runner-up position in the game, but also an improvement in their quarter-final leading games in the final three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a spot in front of the goal and was later switched from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will produce problems for the opponent and will look good in statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we have to perfect this season," Blanc said.
This anticipates good.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret not being able to score one or two more goals.
After an injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the team missed a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentine winger was named a man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass caught behind the Malmö defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. It beat Celtic in the decision game when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense as well as two players in the deep midfield.
But the team offered little more on the offensive side than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went just past the button from Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to missed passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in total in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch right at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing preliminary work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent off a round kick that tilted around the Wiland goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play thanks to Cavan from Uruguay who struck his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had swiped forward Maxwell's cross-pass from left.
It ran out of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's straight kick kept the end numbers down, before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the exchange was disqualified at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion in Share Sale
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, who suffered a commodity price crash, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold some £1.6 billion in new shares to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market capitalization this year, is struggling with the price of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts a strain on demand and wreak havoc on all markets.
The new subscription put the value of Glencore shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold the new share capital for 125 pence a share, which meant a 2.4 percent reduction in Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares at a total value of 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China’s long-standing stagnation have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement released Tuesday by the White House confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders hold bilateral talks.
"Prince Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on numerous global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President Xi to constructively discuss issues of disagreement," the statement added.
On a visit that was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to stop by Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. technology leaders, before continuing towards New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss numerous controversial topics, including Washington's concern over China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes a difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed a difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a film, not a series," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted to the injured incredulously, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay", while comments from The Martian's actor were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the start.
The only dark character is a whore who is beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded harshly that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to disapprove Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the film clip, writing, "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Since its release, the tweet received over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
Following the killing of teenager Michael Brown by white police in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when he introduced the Album of the Year nominations for a Grammy Award.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question as to whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved among entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional rock climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete on Monday to win the American Ninja Warrior race and receive a $1 million grand prize.
There has never been a competitor in the competition program that has just finished its seventh season who has survived all sections of the obstacle track of the program.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the final mission, a rope of about 23 meters had to be climbed in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to clear the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after an elusive win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
“So it’s great to think about it when I’ve never made or lived more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E!.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is going to be... the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten doesn't get more commission money, despite being the first contestant ever to successfully pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he has a grudge.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if it had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for season eight, which begins filming in 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but are now last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed an opportunity to climb a half-way from the Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was for at least one night a return to the six-letter "H" word that had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit scored a run three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 in 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeman to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs which were his first beaten runs since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the latter half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice to the left field line.
Aaron Hicks of the right wing settled on a single-base tap, and Simon was able to directly burn second base player Brian Dozier before Simon was traded to left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player standing against him, ahead of starting substitute Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-base run left of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal leading to the double game.
It was a major league record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double game.
After Detroit had a backup run in the ninth start, Mauer pulled two batted runs against Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sana in three passes in his fifth save.
Detroit initially took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being out for over a month due to lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt I managed to make a few nice passes in the third inning."
After catching the starter hitter for first base, Hughes allowed second base player Ian Kinsler to move forward at once.
J.D. Martinez's walk on the right side in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to bat, who took himself midfield at first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 streak with runners in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos went on to hit right and cause a second run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was disqualified as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers went on in the second inning and received one fire, in a two-base situation a run from catcher James McCann and a two-fire, one-base situation a run from center Anthony Gose, followed by a 3-0.
"It was an important hit," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the pass reading and pitched a runless third inning, then replaced by right-handed forward A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six strokes and a walk on four fires.
NOTES: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was taken off due to an ejection of the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder sprain, but he was due back on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' statistics for the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a stretch of the right oblique abdominal muscle.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open up the economy to the wider world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday that is tasked with guiding reform.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group leading the deepening of the overall reform.
Supporting openness, while driving forward reforms, increases new momentum and vitality, and creates new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list limiting market access, a relaxation of border control principles, a call on state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created to identify the sectors and companies in which no investment is allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors will be opened up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, said in a statement released after the meeting.
