9-year-old boy found dead in Texas
Police have been on a search mission for a nine-year-old boy who ran away in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A report of a boy who had left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
The police situation centre said the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening News around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found in the area around the home, the father said.
Ronaldo on another frenzy - ripping goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league at the weekend and continued to manufacture in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal king turned, at least for a while, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone at the top of the all-time goalscorer standings when he fired visitor Shahtar Donetsk into the net for two hits from the penalty spot and one from the situation in the game.
Ronaldo increased his goal tally to 80 while Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a tally of 77.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but started strongly in Group D of the Champions League with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of the knee-troubled Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in a major league game this weekend, didn't come on until the final ten minutes.
Manchester's other club United were also hit hard in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a one-two defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's away game lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break a tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital for treatment.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno equalized before the break in added time.
PSV's winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The goal-scoring season in the Champions League began with Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the case of Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who swapped Manchester United's shirt for a PSG tutu.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmo goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG have been tipped to be among the season's achievers.
That assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's minor clubs, is not the best comparison.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional starting club Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career at Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team Moscow's TsSKA lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a Group B match in Germany.
Opposition party immediately called for resignation; president gave wrong speech
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had delivered a month ago.
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, has made the same speech in parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirits.
The main opposition MDC party called on Mugabe to step down because he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the mix-up had occurred solely at Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was previously and now about China's influence on the country's economy.
Germany, Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week over the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, which chairs the summits, assessed the request.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin as well as how to more effectively register those coming to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are among the items on the table for interior ministers, according to Merkel.
Professor admits in 911 call that he shot girlfriend
University professor Shannon Lamb, on a 911 call, asked a voice slightly shaking police into his home and told them he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that contact information for the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white document paper: "I am very sorry and wish I could reverse my actions. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb's signed letter read, according to authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online classes at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school's campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor considered dead at the door of his office on campus, who Lamb is believed to have shot.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford noted that university officials were notified of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call some time after that.
Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained visibly behind locked doors, and authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive.
The researchers worked out the details in both locations, and those who knew Lamb told of the man. The researchers came up with a picture of the gifted but perhaps troubled teacher.
Students said they always looked forward to professorial classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he had credited the "lovely people" with whom he got to lead an academic life.
Both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a teaching staff of 17 people. Many of the students attended both men's courses.
Indications of problems emerged, however.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like he had something wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously petitioned Delta State University for medical leave because of some kind of health issue.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that the dissertation, for which Lamb had worked hard, would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
William LaForge, the university's president, said he was not aware of any conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After leaving campus, police worked out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile and a half from his parents' home, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear to police why Mr Lamb had gone to this particular house. However, Mr Johnson said he believed the man knew the occupants of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began work as a geography and education teacher at the university, which has 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 residents in 2009 .
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest-standing friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20 herself.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"At the time Lamb was quite the heartbreaker.
All the girls were scuttling into him," said Hairston, who is now 40 and lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In a 911 call, Lamb said he had killed his wife, but no documents indicate they are not married.
The pair had a dog named Lightning, and lived in a brick house in a river estuary in the small town of Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O'Steen, said she broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and have a daughter who is now 19.
"She was absolutely stunned," O'Steen said of her daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at a summer event three years ago.
They sometimes played together.
O'Steen says her daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica to a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor.”
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," English professor Don Allan Mitchell told me.
He was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
The Delta State University campus in Cleveland has 900 people gathered for a memorial service by candlelight. There were teaching staff, other staff, students and area residents.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the nightly event, where the university choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get students to come back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
It's a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Contributing reporters: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The story has been corrected as police now say that Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot. It was also specified that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the 911 call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us doesn't plan to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products says it will offer its existing employees and seasonal employees the option of additional hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, with new hires starting in October and December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the trading industry's high season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary labor in stores and for the shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a seminal moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had personal significance.
"We were sitting in the theatre and waiting for the royals to arrive. I noticed there was an empty seat next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox shared in the trailer for the upcoming Back in Time documentary.
"When the film started, I realised that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary joins the Back to the Future films, with interviews with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg, in addition to Fox.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"This movie for me is definitely the time travel movie of all time," Spielberg noted.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format and will air in select cinemas from October.
UN chief says no military solution in Syria
Commenting on Russia's intensified military action, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said there was no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that the weapons would only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The secretary-general again called on all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he planned to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria. The meeting would coincide with the UN General Assembly ministerial week later this month.
Ban expressed regret that the split in the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has created a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis that achieved the Iran nuclear deal.
Chapter 8 polls: Is Donald Trump for real?
There have been attempts to brand Trump as a nobody.
He has also been seen as a joke.
Some predict a collapse for Trump.
In Republican circles, every effort has been made (so far) without success to drag Trump down from the poll lead.
Ten of the 11 national polls show double-digit approval ratings for Donald Trump. Some are already seriously considering what that actually says about the real estate mogul's candidacy chances.
True, the election is in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be nominated for the Republican nomination.
Experts remind us that at this time in 2011, pollster Rick Perry was allowed to give way to a rising Herman Cain. Neither ultimately won a candidate election in any of the states.
For many reasons, Trump would have a tough time in a general election.
Outside factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC as well as the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and begun digging in their doves to topple him.
The following recent polling data shows that the property mogul cannot be dismissed with a shrug:
There has been an about-face in Trump's endorsement.
Just before Trump announced he was running in mid-June, according to a Monmouth University poll, only two in 10 Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, already 40 percent had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding figure was 52 per cent.
Now, six in 10 Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative opinion.
Those numbers also hold in states where elections are held first.
At last week's Quinnipiac gallup, 60 percent of Republicans had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would welcome a Trump candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans polled said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's potential pick for the nomination.
Only two in 10 would be highly dissatisfied with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson elicits a response almost as enthusiastic as Trump's (43 percent would be very happy with Carson's candidacy and 40 percent with Trump's).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
In third place is Marco Rubio, with a similar 21 percent approval rating.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were chosen as the party's nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for pomp and offensive comments. Fifty-two percent of Republican supporters nationwide think the real estate mogul's qualities are appropriate for a president. The views are evident from an ABC News/Washington Post poll.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the convention will be held first: According to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52 percent of Republicans think Trump's personal qualities are appropriate for a commander-in-chief.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think Trump is not capable of performing the job effectively, and six in 10 think Trump's temperament is unbecoming of the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When asked by Republicans who is most likely to be chosen as the party's nominee, according to a CNN/ORC poll, four in 10 believe in Trump's chances.
That has changed since mid-July, when four in 10 would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: Republicans haven't had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four in 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry was the likely candidate, and only 28 percent thought Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find the Trump campaign persuasive.
Even if Republicans back another candidate, Trump will trump almost every other candidate.
Some experts think the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents split into supporters of different candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win over a larger base of supporters.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15, Jeb Bush with 19 and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would trump Trump by 19 points in an imaginary duel.
A narrow majority of Trump supporters say they have already made a decision to vote.
According to a CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday, well over half of Trump supporters are confident in their voting decision.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his or her mind.
Forty-six percent of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's toughest rival at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans agree with Trump's view on migration.
Since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, migration has been a hot topic of 2016.
Some worry that Trump's bombastic speeches will drive important Hispanic voters away from Republican forces and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to ABC News and Washington Post poll results released Monday, six in 10 Republicans are on the same page as Trump on immigration issues.
As long as migration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently garner a combined total of about half of the Republican vote. The popularity is significantly boosted by the fact that both have come to run as outsiders.
In the Republican ranks, they want a fresh face as a candidate instead of a policy veteran. According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, that view was held by six in 10 Republicans.
The two candidates are also fractious for Washington.
According to a poll commissioned by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three in four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican action in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the verge of outrage."
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
After the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
Labour's new frontbencher Jeremy Corbyn is due to stand up for the first time to mingle his strength with David Cameron on Question Time later.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after midday. The media and Labour figures will be watching the man with a hard eye.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more fact-finding for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he could skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
The encounter will see Corbyn's leadership weighed in for the first time in the context. Corbyn will now face a parliamentary test following the assembly of the shadow cabinet and his speech to Corbyn's Trade Union Confederation (TUC) annual conference on Tuesday.
The decision by the Labour frontbencher to keep quiet during the 75th anniversary of the UK's air war during the national anthem on Tuesday has been criticised by a number of Tory party representatives. The silence has also made the front page headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem drew attention
Corbyn's representative noted that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, silently honoring the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
But Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the party leader to join in the national anthem despite his opposition to the monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences on economic, defence and foreign affairs. Fewer than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant thinks political differences over the UK's membership of the EU and the government's clampdown on benefits have been piling up in the Labour Party since Mr Corbyn's appointment.
Mr Corbyn told a TUC meeting that Labour would propose changes to remove restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow cabinet secretary for work and pensions, said the party's position was very clear: it was only opposed to the government's plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will face in the past decade at the head of the Tory party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a new approach to politics, says he has chosen the questions to be put to Mr Cameron from the 30,000 proposals he has received from the public.
Mr Corbyn, who was elected in the Islington North constituency, says there are too many clashes on Question Time. Indeed, he promises to avoid clever diction and loan-throwing and says he will focus instead on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has stated that shadow minister Angela Eagle fills in for him during Question Time, for example when Mr Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also thrown into the air the idea that others could also get out loud at times. He says he has discussed the issue with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons.
After Corbyn took over the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppeteer-like policy, often associated with Question Time. Some years later, however, he admitted that he had failed in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of a leader's judgment, control of the House of Commons and position. But critics say Question Time has become a caricature in need of major reform.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless youth to photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A group of former street children has found a meaningful way to learn and make money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a nonprofit filming studio that teaches homeless youth how to photograph their homeland and earn while doing so.
BBC News met the youngster, who has been among the first to graduate through the project.

Pound strengthens as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller dragged the FTSE 100 index higher.
Between May and July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year. Bonuses were not included.
The faster-than-forecast growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1 per cent to $1.5505 against the euro and to €1.3730 against the euro.
The FTSE 100 index rose 1.49 per cent to end at 6,229.21 points.
The biggest riser was SABMiller, whose rate soared 20 per cent when the company received an initial takeover offer from rival firm AB InBev.
If completed, the deal would combine the world's two largest brewing companies and bring under one roof brands including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 per cent in the wake of positive results from rival group Richemont, which focuses on luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. Sales momentum was also bullish in Burberry's key market of China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 per cent after the mining giant announced plans to raise $2.5bn through a share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Shares in Mondi, the packaging and paper group, were the biggest faller with their 4.3 per cent drop as Goldman Sachs dropped the price of shares in the company for sale purposes.
JD Sports was up 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its pre-tax profit will rise 83 per cent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss says higher wage bills could hamper expansion
Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, said an increase in the minimum wage in the UK would mean more buying power for would-be customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs for the company.
Mr Cowgill said rising labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for more labour.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi surge
Metcash is seeking to secure its IGA stores from a takeover by Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain IGA retail market share in South and Western Australia against Aldi's 700 million Australian dollar invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year. Metcast and the IGA supermarkets will solidify their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media, as well as hosting events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastings in IGA stores, and merchants sell regular customers tickets to South Australian Football League games at discount prices.
Metcash is expected to announce more details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler will hold its annual investment strategy day.
At issue is a significant market, with South and Western Australia making up almost 30 per cent of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and these areas have a higher margin yield than the IGA store network in the eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for being parochial, and indeed IGA retailers have a significantly higher market share in the region than NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30 per cent and Western Australia 24 per cent, while eastern states account for just 14 per cent.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley, for example, believe Aldi will grab 5 per cent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of the first stores opening. The chain is eating into sales from all operators, but especially from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated there could be a $360 million sell-off for IGA traders and a $250 million notch for Metcash by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and reach sales of between $500 million and $600 million in those areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume could mean it losing $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, notes Kierath.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although recent research by Roy Morgan suggests IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, a leading portfolio manager at Magellan Financial Group, told an event in Melbourne that he thought it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public stance on Douglass' comments.
It is understood a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has dropped from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash's food business, which serves 1,200 IGA dealers, has seen its earnings fall 43 per cent from 2012 levels. The figures show a reduction in debt financing as pressures hit sales and margins.
However, the wholesale operator is taking countermeasures and is making an annual investment of more than 150 million Australian dollars to match Coles and Woolworths prices on hundreds of products each week. The chain wants to support retailers in revamping stores to boost fresh produce offerings and improve the store's own-brand food range.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says a review of prices and plans to revamp stores are well under way, with the company able to increase profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves special mention for his behaviour rather than criticism.
According to Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral damage in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related yupaka. Kokkinakis deserves special mention in lieu of criticism.
Kokkinakis, the younger side of the duo named "Special K," was thrust into an unfavourable spotlight when bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the ATP tournament in Montreal.
Shortly thereafter, in a qualifying game between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the umpire twice had to separate the rivals. "Wawrinka should have given a beating to Kyrgiosis and me for that guy," Harrison noted.
At the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis hit the court with a bat in frustration as strong cramps marred his match. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
Currently the teenage star is in Glasgow where he will battle with Sam Groth for the singles second spot behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I feel strongly that Thanasi has been dragged into the controversy," Healy said.
"He broke a racket when he lost a match at the U.S. Open. He is by no means the first player to break his racket out of frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he has done.
But he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behavior at the U.S. Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him and I just think he's been treated a little bit unfairly.
He is very mature for 19, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among the players. He trains hard, is in good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I feel he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also backed the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian squad for the all-important round that starts on Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he is in favour of the Canberra-raised returning as a long-term endorsement of the team.
"First and foremost, we want to focus fully on the matches rather than the polemic surrounding Kyrgios," stated Healy.
Nick has come out on top quickly. As Federer and Murray, among others, have pointed out, the youngster will have to grow up in the public spotlight. He deserves the criticism he has received for his bad mistakes. However, we will try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We will also try to provide him with some privacy. I believe it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
Europe migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border from the direction of Serbia on Tuesday and apprehended illegal immigrants. The aim was to stem the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border as hundreds of migrants piled into the no man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on a stretch of road between checkpoints in the countries in their tents for an indefinite period
Frustration began to surface.
As a police helicopter flew through the air above the migrants, they chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some went on an eating and drinking strike in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it would not accept migrants being sent back to Hungary at the same time as more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on Hungary's border with Serbia began a day later when the 28-nation bloc failed in attempts to develop a common migration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
But the ministers agreed that responsibility for the 40,000 influx of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is shared. The meeting raised hopes that an agreement could be reached by next month or the end of the year on which EU member states would take in 120,000 migrants, including from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called an extraordinary summit for the next week on Tuesday to discuss the migrant crisis on the continent.
But Hungary was not pinning its hopes on swift action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to adopt more effective measures, namely closing roads and speeding up legal procedures in the area of asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto noted that Hungary is also planning a barbed-wire fence on the Romanian border to stem the flow of migrants from that direction, now that a fence is already complete on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners took part in the bidding process for the job of finishing the barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck for migrants and a transit point to the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people arriving are standard of living refugees, not war refugees with the right to seek refuge. The view diverges sharply from those of other EU states, including Germany.
Under the new law, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is an offence to cross or damage a four-metre high barbed wire fence the government has built on the southern border in the direction of Serbia. The law also specifies longer prison terms for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by the mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis in the country," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the town of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are taking a hard line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, parliament still has to approve military action, which is expected next week. Associated Press news agency reporters along the border have for several days seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs.
Orban's internal security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had apprehended 45 people trying to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further afield.
People who have been able to cross the border by damaging the fence are now being held by the police, charged with crimes under new laws.
Authorities are quickly mending the fence.
In addition, Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings on the Serbian border on Tuesday. One border crossing was closed using a train car covered in barbed wire.
Chaos engulfed the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened an access point in a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked a main street linking Serbia and Hungary. People reported being on an eating and drinking strike until they are allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders narrowed by half, according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's approval rating is still in double digits in the race for the Democratic national presidential nomination. However, Sen. Bernie Sanders has closed the gap.
Clinton's approval rating now stands at 47 percent of the vote among Democratic supporters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has yet to announce his possible departure to enter the presidential race. His approval rating among Democrats stands at 15 percent.
With more than five months to go before the primaries, it's too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
But Clinton's supporters are more confident than those of the other candidates about their choice.
Since the poll was commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a solid lead among women and moderates, but the lead has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly, and she has only a 5 percent bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost her lead among Democrats under 50, and she is now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in endorsements over Sanders among liberals was in double digits, but now Sanders has taken a five percentage point neck and neck on Clinton in this group.
About half of Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if she is chosen as the party's nominee.
A quarter would support Clinton with minor reservations, and 15 percent would support her just because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support Clinton.
It should come as no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters, too, if she is chosen as the nominee.
There is more dispersion in views among those who do not currently endorse as Clinton. Only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
Forty-eight percent of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 percent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular rationale is Clinton's right kind of experience (16 percent). The second most popular answer is that it's time to elect a female president (13 percent) and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cite her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
There will also be mention of congruent views and chances of winning the actual election.
The vice president is still weighing his possible candidacy, and 57 percent of Democratic voters would prefer him to enter the race. A third would prefer to drop him out of the race instead.
When Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate for the party's nomination, the majority choose Biden.
For more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't enter the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over Sanders. With Sanders on board, the lead will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't enter the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters view Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election proper. However, the share is down from 78 percent last month.
Biden, who is in second place, is far behind Clinton, but even more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual election.
But Democratic voters consider views on issues of substance more important than the candidates' chances of winning.
Voters don't think any of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be characteristics-appropriate.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often seen as the type of leader.
As many as 30 percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, compared to 15 percent of Sanders. Twenty-seven percent can't say whether Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters think the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to voters' own ideology.
For all the features, about a quarter have no opinion of Sanders.
When voters are asked for their views on Hillary Clinton's use of private e-mail and her own server as secretary of state, a majority of Democratic voters report that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and that has not changed those voters' perception of Clinton.
Americans more broadly disagree.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's survey, and only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans think the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. Thirty-six percent say the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of that 36 percent, the majority, six in 10, are Republicans.
While voters in her own party view Clinton as honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these qualities when all voters' views are asked: Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by only 32 percent, down 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points from May.
Sixty-two percent of all voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of all voters nationwide don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates in the poll, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority thinks Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The poll has a sample of 351 voters, and the poll has a margin of error of 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catches up with Donald Trump's lead in national poll of support
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll of endorsements, Ben Carson has gained on Donald Trump.
The two candidates garnered more than half the vote in the new poll, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters nationwide, Trump still has solid support. The support share is up from 23 percent in a CBS poll commissioned before the Fox News debate last month. The poll released Tuesday puts the approval rating at 27 percent.
But Carson's approval rating shot up to a staggering 6 percent to 23 percent over the same time period.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support across all demographic groups. In the college-educated group, he narrowly beats Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, lag far behind. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's support is weakest and has dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio shared third place with 6 percent support.
The margin of error in a sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 percent one way or the other. The poll was conducted in September.
According to the latest CNN/ORC poll released last week, Carson's approval rating is on the rise. He is supported by 19 percent of Republicans, compared to 32 percent for Trump.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump with a clear lead ahead of Carson.
In the men's encounter last week, Trump fired false accusations at a retired neurosurgeon. Carson, however, apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump stated Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
After the death of a student at a fraternity ritual in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains nearly two years ago, five people will be read murder charges.
Members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a christening in September 2013. Police said the fraternity did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was deemed to have contributed to his death.
Authorities said the victim had his eyes blindfolded, had a nearly 15-pound backpack stuffed with sand placed on his back and had been attacked repeatedly as he tried to reach a target positioned across an icy field.
Deng reportedly first complained of headaches and then lost consciousness.
Police said members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness. They allegedly waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told a press conference, however, that members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the fraternity president, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide instruments, putting the best interests of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner noted.
Deng could not be revived, and died the next morning.
The autopsy report said Deng had been hit several times in the head, torso and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the hazing of the fraternity, with at least one student a year dying as a result of hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The municipalities and their members must be held accountable, and the authorities must take an important step.
A Monroe County grand jury presented five fraternity members to be charged with third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity face charges of hazing and criminal conspiracy. Meng is also among the defendants.
"We want to hold accountable not only the individuals, but the organization that formally or informally approved the hazing," Wagner told a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch College put the fraternity out of business, and the national fraternity resigned from the local branch.
Here's how the U.S. Federal Reserve's (Fed's) interest rate hike will affect
Rising interest rates and a boom in the stock market are souring, securities yields are rising and the economy is sliding into a depression.
We know that.
We don’t know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
In the case of the economy, in particular, we find hints of timing in history.
The recession has arrived in up to 11 months since the first interest rate hike and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, though not always. The determining factor is how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why central bank officials have already been vehemently stressing that investors would pay attention not to when interest rates start to rise but to how long it will take for the situation to normalize.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
Ultimately, though, market participants may find that any fuss about raising interest rates may be overblown.
"The central bank's first withdrawal since the global financial crisis was no doubt often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to fairly low levels, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
But that doesn't mean there won't be an impact.
Here are examples, based on historical trends, of how the effects can be seen in different areas of the economy:
As the market has seen for about a month now, the portent of raising interest rates could add to volatility for a while.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect won't be so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be for capital yields to stagnate after the first drawdown for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting yet another lag in monetary policy, a Deutsche Bank analyst noted in a recent study of the consequences of rising interest rates.
Adjusted over 35 years, the market usually sees a sharp rise in interest rates at the time of the rise, around 14 per cent, fairly flat for the next 250 days (an average rise of 2.6 per cent), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average yield on fixed income after six share cycles is 14.4 per cent, according to Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to intensify a little later in the cycle and fixed income starts to decline.
The recession is a fact of life in the economy, but rising interest rates tend to do the trick.
In this case, if the central bank faces conditions that didn't exist before and could spur a downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest level ever for a central bank rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 policy rate hikes since 1950, only twice has the face value been below 4.5 per cent.
While the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 percent, not many imagined it would last, and the third quarter is at 1.5 percent, according to the Atlanta Regional Federal Reserve.
Raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic climate can have its risks and one can ask whether this situation is different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the key interest rate all year, and eyes will turn to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the drawdown at this meeting, futures trading will show only a 25 percent probability.
"In our studies, from 1950 all withdrawal cycles up to today have been in a supercycle, with GDP, which was also falling before the downturn, rising very rapidly after the start of the boom," it said.
The recovery has been extremely slow compared to the worst recession of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the Federal Reserve has been waiting since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already the 74th month.
Fixed income securities have also been volatile as the market heralds a rate hike, and the pattern is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in equities when the central bank changes course.
For bonds, the yield seems to change direction immediately as the first up/down cycle kicks in.
At the end of the bullish cycle, yields will fall immediately," Deutsche noted.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe the rate hike will cause long- and short-term bonds to approach each other and flatten the curve.
"High-yield bonds often do better in this kind of environment, although we're still cautious about yields," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income securities analyst at Schwab.
Intriguingly, Mr Jones says the market has already adapted to the central bank's upcoming change in direction.
"Beyond dollar appreciation and inflation forecasts, we are already seeing a number of signs of adjustment to tighter financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is straight, credit risk spreads have widened and volatility has increased. All are typical of markets in a situation where the central bank is tightening policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mainly in the U.S. market are benefiting because interest rates are falling and local products are starting to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as a strengthening dollar causes their products to become more expensive in global markets and debt to become more expensive.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more lucrative in the three months following a rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed companies with weak balance sheets after rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility stocks, also fared better in quality, averaging 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"The debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable-rate debt stand to lose the most," Goldman noted.
Outside the stock market, consumers also tend to benefit from the dollar's strengthening.
Savers will also benefit thanks to higher returns. Experts are, admittedly, divided on how quickly the effects will be seen.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for becoming too popular.
Mr Bingham said it was now difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial rival.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards are just a copy of the Brits.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, meanwhile, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 will gradually become a copy of Classic FM. The allegations will increase pressure on the station to prove it offers more than just each commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel was becoming too populist and the channel would no longer be much different from its commercial rival.
"I hate to talk about popularisation, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham concluded.
The BBC Music Awards last December is also being criticised by Mr Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, held for the first time last year, seems like a copy of the Brits awards.
These two are examples of imitating what is already on the market instead of what is new and different," Bingham says.
The BBC's director-general denied the allegations, noting that BBC Radio 3's offering far outstrips its commercial rival in live music and educational content.
"From Radio 3, I learned something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music making is in a class all of its own.
I also think it's important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and commissioning new works," the director general stated.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, the head of BBC Radio 3, said the station needed to work harder to keep the public interested as Britons were more familiar with classical music.
But Radio 3 is not the only BBC channel to face fierce criticism for stepping on the turf of commercial channels, at a hearing of the restricted Culture, Media and Sport Committee.
Tory party parliamentarian Damien Collins criticised The Voice talent show, which was bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media. The deal is estimated to cost £22m.
"There is little discussion of the programme, which is not unique or particularly distinctive."
Lord Hall said the programme, presented by BBC1 with Paloma Faith and Boy George as its star judges, was produced in a manner typical of the BBC.
In addition, Collins called for the company to find a hit show in its own stable the next time it launches a new entertainment series.
But Collins refused to rule out that The Voice will continue to be commissioned or that taxpayer money will be used for other entertainment formats.
E-commerce growth slowest ever in August – perhaps due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
E-commerce sales have been recorded since 2000. Last month, the growth was the slowest ever.
E-commerce was strengthened three years ago by mobile shopping.
Experts believe Black Friday in November can curb buying appetites.
For more than a decade, the conquest of online shopping has deserted many of Britain's shopping streets.
Experts say there are indications that online shopping is levelling off, with new sales figures showing only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, total sales growth was the slowest in all the time that e-commerce sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000.
Experts say there are indications that online shopping is levelling off, with new sales figures showing only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth with 2000 readings, it's clear that growth will plateau over time," Andy Mulcahy, IMRG's editor-in-chief, told the Guardian.
Mulcahy said e-commerce gained momentum three years ago as consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, for example from a home sofa.
With mobile buying now more moderate, growth may plateau."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
Experts say the theme day, celebrated on the last Friday in November, could prompt consumers to put off a decision on buying until Black Friday.
Last year, five times the normal number of online shoppers caused many merchants' websites to crash.
Experts believe Black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd around for deals, can curb shopping appetites at other times.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that a fair pound for every £5 spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are bought online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
Mecca to bury crane accidents victims, Bin Laden family held accountable
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims in the streets as the first funeral takes place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia says construction major Saudi Binladin Group is complicit in the accident.
The Health Ministry said 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
Bodies carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of a crane that fell on Mecca's Grand Mosque
Crowds of people dressed in white had gathered in the streets to bid farewell to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A mourning convoy passed through a pilgrimage site where a fallen construction crane had just a day earlier penetrated the roof of a mosque on top of Muslims.
Saudi Arabia's king calls for Bin Laden's construction family business to be held accountable for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims killed in the crane accident at Mecca's Grand Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead after the crane fell was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had travelled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were beginning their annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have promised that a hajj pilgrimage will take place as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said Binladin Group should not have left the crane's boom up when the crane was not being used.
According to an Arabic-language press release, Binladin Group is complicit in the accident.
The English language service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to a statement in English, the management of the group has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued a news release about the crane accident, and representatives of the group have not been reached for a statement.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of Binladin Group's giant construction project.
The bin Laden family has had close ties to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and the bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
The late leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident, which occurred in heavy rain and high winds, occurred just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim is obliged to do at least once in a lifetime.
Officials say 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (about 250,000 euros) to the families of the victims and to the permanently disabled.
Those injured in the accident will receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says the phenomenon is being driven by cheap eastern European labour
Britons are hiring home handymen more often than ever, says Veronique Laury
The popularity of skilled, self-employed workers from Eastern Europe has increased.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores aimed at workmen will open.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be shifting the hammering and painting of the home to agents from Eastern Europe.
The skills of hammering and painting seem to be few and far between these days.
Britons are now increasingly hiring home handymen to do the housework, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of stores for home refurbishment supplies. Laury says the phenomenon is driven by skilled workmen arriving from Eastern Europe to provide services at low prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores aimed at traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury craves more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of 10 shopping decisions in-store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, demographic trends should be taken into account, as more and more single women are also renovating their homes.
"The staff at our stores are still, for the most part, men," says Laury.
"We have to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchasing decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women at the helm of companies that are part of the British FTSE 100 index. She has also restructured the company's management team so that there are equal numbers of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with exactly 50 per cent of its staff being women, including the chief executive and finance director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told me.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the leadership team."
Kingfisher's half-year operating profit and sales figures show a decline, although the firm did do some hard work following the closures of stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained pretty quickly.
The sharp end of SAK and other employee centre organisations started to be forced right away and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread protest of workers.
For many people, this also makes sense.
Asking if it's worth going on strike when things are going badly anyway.
A resistance movement has even been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to say that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, such a thing would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online place to protest, but openly declaring yourself a miscreants would have been the political suicide of a small person.
A protest by a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members is not much to worry about, but it does give food for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone feels the movement's goals are their own, values have changed
From the point of view of how interesting the trade union movement is, the government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of things seeming to roll on their own, the unions are now finally getting to the point of defending workers’ rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to strengthen the role of the trade union movement when membership in a trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
No matter what we think about the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has long since stopped.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta to make massive savings: Targeted savings of 8.5 million, personnel to be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings programme that aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start employee co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, that means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional $2 million will be saved from other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8.5 million euros.
It will also be affected by government spending cuts.
This financial year, the university will post a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenses will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of the massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant,” says Rector Anneli Pauli.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Talks with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and last for the six weeks stipulated by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the biggest rail companies in Britain," says Souter.
Rail services are to gradually open up to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. central bank has rate decision time
The entire world will be watching Wednesday and Thursday's U.S. Fed meeting to decide on a possible interest rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade.
Just over half of the economists who still believed the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates last week are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current range of 0 to 0.25 percent, according to a Reuters poll of 80 economists.
"It's a historic situation as the central bank has kept interest rates around zero for seven years now.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from the zero level and thus trigger the normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the U.S. economy has been relatively good, with stimulus bringing trillions of additional dollars onto the balance sheet and fueling little inflation.
But the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy.
It has urged markets to be prepared for change, but there are also indications to the contrary.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20.00 Central European Time.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
(CNN) -- After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning -- before shooting a colleague later that day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to reverse it, authorities said Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 about 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot a person.
In a 911 call, Lamb asked police to his home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house who is no trouble for anyone but is probably scared.
Police asked for the caller's name, but the man wouldn't give it.
Lamb also did not give a motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, along with a handwritten note from Lamb that read as follows: "I am very sorry and wish I could reverse my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.'
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police reached him.
William LaForge, the university's president, said he was not aware of any conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt. However, authorities announced Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for seven years, characterized his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
He said his mother and daughter were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, said that Prentiss was working online from home.
Knowles noted that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years. He also told her about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives Monday and told them he wasn't going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that evening, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to a résumé on the university's site, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Dimmed stars
The last few years have been hard on the actor (pictured left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, she battled leukemia, and in 2009, her longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, passed away from cancer.
The actor has also struggled with narcotics, and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for months by two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken during Manchester United's Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender will have the annoyance of staying on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains hopeful and believes Shaw will be back on the pitch again this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in PSV's defensive zone in a poor tackle by Héctor Moreno with 15 minutes to go in the game.
Shaw was given on-field first aid for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's hospitalized," Van Gaal noted.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after for surgery in Manchester.
The youngster, who joined Manchester United at the age of 18, has been through a tough time and is now injured after a string of stunning performances.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when you break a leg in two places, he's on the sidelines for half a month and he's not playing in the group stage anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno appeared to have come up short when the situation did not result in a red card penalty.
Match umpire Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian referee made a mistake.
"You can judge for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot reckless tackle.'
Shaw tweeted thus: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't put into words how devastated I am. My recovery starts here and I will be back even stronger."

The England defender has a particular reason to recover to race at the European Championship in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," stated the PSV coach.
"In injury situations like this, all parties are always very sorry.
It's never the players' intention to harm the opponent.'
Moreno broke his shin while playing for Mexico against the Netherlands, piloted by Van Gaal, only at the 2014 world championships.
"He is very sorry as it was not his intention to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to be told that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
“I didn’t see the situation myself.
I just saw the ball that was going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult a situation like this can be," Moreno stated to SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm very sorry."
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Before long, every parent will notice that their child is learning their favorite books almost by heart.
Except you'll see David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organisation asked Mr Cameron to name his favourite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an educational environmental story by Dr Seuss published in 1971.
In a text posted on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that it was a difficult choice. "The story is funny, touching and creative, with a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there's always an image or message we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is the executive summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complete the shortish opening text.
"The city of Tarville, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, is home to a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see a real tree," the text says. In the version of Dr. Seuss, aka Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, Ted had no object of fascination.
Unless this is still suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book's plot will be so alien to him. Greedy Kerskanen disposes of trees and prepares them into Tarvs despite the objections of the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, moustachioed creature that protects forests.
Most likely, a public relations assignment of minor importance like this one has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently one who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child,.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister told me that the text probably originated in Mr Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps would not comment further but confirmed that the text was written by Mr Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being out of the England squad but it's still tough
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but having seen the team picked by England for the tour, a repeat of their recent 3-0 Test series defeat is not expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of an away win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but there are good players in the batting team and the attitude of the team is strong – they have no bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali is developing as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, despite having no Test-level experience, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave out Adam Lyth is obviously hard for me to understand as his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged by results.
Joe Root, for example, is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – the players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point games would have kept Lyth in the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
Hopefully he will get another chance when he hits more runs for Yorkshire.
The England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he wasn't doing as well as he could have done, which doesn't surprise me. He is first and foremost a team player.
The question of how long a Test batsman gets the chance to impress is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven groundstrokes – as did his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance in both home and away games.
The only cause for complaint, perhaps, is that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes into the team and he's a batter I rate highly.
He is an unknown factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge ground.
He must be granted at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start batting with Cook, getting an extra twist pitcher into the game while keeping four quick pitchers, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see an obstacle to a top pitcher being able to bat in this, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have accomplished much in his local team, Worcestershire, but he has been the number three player in the squad and that is not a big difference.
My former team-mate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first substitute before getting started in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup thread pitcher, and from what I've seen of him, he's proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher – and this can be a long shot, but not too many spiral pitchers have shown themselves ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He's going to learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside of the playing squad, England seem to have made a couple of smart choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's batsman, Mahela Jayawardene, as an adviser to Test matches could be a through-line.
This is one of the most endearing men in the sport who brings a lot of experience because he has played in all sorts of conditions and against all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball portion of the game and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed suited to international cricket, whether his role is as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has an intellect to exploit.
Sometimes a new voice in the locker room, even if it's saying the same thing as before, can be a boost.
Colly's team-mate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been rested for the one-day matches, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don't set the match schedule.
And you have to keep in mind that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp could win if economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain staying in the EU is in a deeper morass by the day, even without the likeable Jeremy "yes or no" Corbyniak's election to the Labour leadership or the TUC making a fierce mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU wallows in – even if not all of them of its own making. Some member states are fed up with Britain's complacent agenda of divisive concessions and damaging treaty changes that they don't really even want.
In Brighton, at the TUC's annual congress, it was decided that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it eroded social security.
We could call it, say, Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and the chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in the capitals of various countries, grab a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without senior figures, return home and tell us they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My fellow European who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says, suggesting that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in various capitals have come to the point where they no longer care whether we stay or go.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent chancellor is an ally but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande faces re-election or the election of a successor in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain will have a left-wing government.
It's hard to imagine them dashing off to help selfie Britons who could put their energies to better use trying to stop Scotland leaving the UK. They don't want that either, because the majority have separatist tendencies.
Some of such ministers may be planning to deliberately throw unhelpful comments in the style of the Scottish National Party at the UK's 2017 People's Election campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my pal suggests.
"The renegotiation was an organised affair. The UK was left with nothing in hand from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the British press is and how EU-skeptical the oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum engineered by Tony Benn, whose result advocated a 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remotely remembers Boris Johnson, the boorish Euro-opportunist who became known as our "EU direct bananas correspondent" in Brussels in the early 90s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include the tax-dodging, phone-hacking and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought pretty much the same of them, but then realised that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand in bananas as a distraction so the gorilla doesn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more Blairite in his opposition to the referendum. Blair, after all, acquiesced to the EU constitution, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in a referendum in 2005, Blair got off handily.
The press never forgave him for that, either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who graciously patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday. I told him he had no more time to waste on me. There could be a risk of him deploying Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the Eighties. It was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for socialising with the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marr, on whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call edifying.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
The majority of people outside Ukip and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told radio and television this week, when his inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad bet for Corbyn to appoint the rugged John McDonnell as shadow Treasury secretary.
It reminded me of the Seventies, when his old father had trouble being disloyal on television to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Mr Benn said he was opposed to remaining in the EU "in all circumstances." Neither Mr McDonnel said that nor Mr Corbyn to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
However sucky Corbyn wants to convey the image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. Message discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the throes of social media, where paranoia and deceit smolder.
Mr Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as Mr McDonnell has stated.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivocation on EU membership fits with a bennite blockade economy and an anti-capitalist past. Conversations no longer belong only to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents for whom the idea that similarity unites is a central tenet of doctrinal wrangling.
We have also seen an equanimity when it comes to Nato. Tom Watson is adamant that Corbyn will not campaign for the departure. Foreign diplomats will be forced to try to clarify the issue for their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have sceptical voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when it can all be for naught?
The US is already pretty much disappointed by the British dismal military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts under the Tory government. I was reminded of that on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise British official's statements on e-cigarettes
The researchers said the claims by the government-funded institution that smoking e-cigarettes is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking arose at a meeting, some of whose 12 participants have ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in a report on e-cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE), the public health authority.
PHE described its report, published last month, as a "transformational and comprehensive review of results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and raised the issue of some experts' affiliation with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal last month took a "remarkably squishy foundation" to the teeth on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have been considering in the BMJ whether the claims were based on "rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have said the following: "The basic assumption of public health care is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
McKee and Capewell say the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research findings.
The claim stems from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model was designed to unify participants' views on the harms of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled into a study.
McKee and Capewell said the meeting's backers included EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, the CEO demonstrated his support for BAT's public health compliance in the Sustainability Action Report.
One of the meeting's 12 participants awarded funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer. However, alleged prior funding from tobacco company Philip Morris International was not awarded by that participant.
No explanation has been given as to the criteria for selecting the panel's composition. However, there are several well-known proponents of e-cigarettes, some of whom admit their involvement as industry financiers.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco officer.
McKee and Capewell said the group's research report shows there is no conclusive evidence that the products are harmful to a wide range of products and that their criteria are met.
However, there is no mention of affiliations or shortcomings in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been presented that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's director of health and wellbeing, said the claims had been answered in the past.
Fenton said e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke through life dies due to tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco. However, the long-term effects need to be investigated further.
PHE is obliged to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative dangers compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths in the UK every year, and smoking costs the public health service £2 billion a year.
To act responsibly, we need to clearly state the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but that the harm they cause is a fraction of that of conventional tobacco.
BBC should abandon EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, who was in charge of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes. These include EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial contestants would give their right hand to hit shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
Mr Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programmes that other television stations do not.
He criticised the BBC for airing programmes likely to reach smaller audiences at the same time as rivals' big ratings programmes, as well as on channels such as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, the BBC's director-general, announced that the corporation wanted to increase co-operation with other organisations, Mr Johnson said he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 to work with the BBC, without success.
"I don't agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that would clearly fall within the remit of some rival channel," Mr Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee, which was working out the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least scale back its offering to programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is broadcasting The Voice in prime time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel takes up the show, that's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for it.
I don't see how this serves the broadcaster's service offering.
I don't think these would be a loss for the BBC.'
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He thinks the BBC hoovers up good ratings because of the ambitious people who work at the corporation and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Mr Johnson's comments about the BBC's most popular shows parallel those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested during his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell off shows such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for the BBC's niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings are mostly unquantifiable, but the programmes fulfil their purpose. "The BBC can say, in excusing its hypocritical broadcasting fees of £4 billion, that they did make extraordinary programmes that nobody watched."
"The BBC airs them at times no one ever sees them."
On broadcasting fees, Mr Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system in the same old-fashioned sense of who gets the best out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is affordable, but people for whom it's a big amount, especially if you don't watch much of the BBC."
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also gave his own views at the committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should swap its ancient missions for new ones to "inform, teach and entertain."
According to Elstein, there is hardly any educational programming in the BBC's current offering - 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change its mission: "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the collaborative issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts from events such as the Proms festival, for which only a fraction of concerts were broadcast last year. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the full offering available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows the nematode changing direction when ultrasound is applied to them.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system, which allows the worms to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound, the frequency of which is above the auditory range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion neurons that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that responds to ultrasound.
MORE: Scientists Track Brain Activity Using Light
According to the researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). The method utilizes ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
Nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound. However, Chalasani noticed that the worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
Chalasan says the bubbles intensify ultrasound waves that propagate inside the worms.
Augmented ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels that are present in some of the worms' cell membranes.
According to a paper published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves controlling their movement appeared TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed at the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified sound waves and migrated to the worms, setting off a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is a bit like optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows scientists to activate nerve cells using light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is light directed to the brain under study using optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, penetrate the cell easily, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and viral therapy, human nerve cells can be momentarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," concluded Chalasani.
According to the researcher, the method could also be utilized in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illicit Torture Tools on Your Doorstep!
Adverts are an embarrassment to Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-gun fair video.
Terrible killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leg irons!
Grape bombs!
Remote Tasers that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The happy voice and cartoons clearly reveal that the advert in question for the world's largest arms fair is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and is intended to highlight the British regime's drive to sell arms to repressive regimes at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) fair, which takes place at the ExCel exhibition centre in London's Docklands.
More on: DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
Posters also pop up at bus stops and subway cars, requiring a second glance.
"Important announcement: will you take the metro from 15th to 18th September?" The announcement is similar to the announcements on the London Underground.
"In September, a number of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers are being asked for help to ensure the arms fair can be abolished."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was displayed at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters across London with a £6 "advertising space hacking kit" with hex keys to access around a third of the advertising poster racks at the world's bus stops, according to the claim.
Transport for London is not laughed at by poster vandalism.
One of the mock ads from the Special Patrol Group collective.
Gavin Grindon, a curator at Cruel Designs and lecturer at Essex University, said artists have begun to question issues and want to make their political work available for public viewing outside galleries.
Artists have noticed that social impact through art requires art to be brought into the real world, and many move on to work with activists from protest movements.
Another of the anti-gun-trafficking posters greets public transit users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over 24 hours via Facebook. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narrator have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the VCCP's artistic director, took issue with the absence of trade show advertising and the blank spot on ExCeL's calendar of events. He mused: "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, shady corporate video, but the bright colors and animation attract more attention.”
"They have done a magnificent job and helped us highlight the fair where the illegal torture equipment trade is taking place," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that instruments of torture are not illegally trafficked right on our doorstep."
Perhaps the most creative aspect of the arms fair is, however, on display at ExCeLi itself, where exhibitors make great use of euphemisms for their merchandise.
In its press release, Saab announced an order placed by the U.S. military for "a portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a specially designed warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dorms
I moved into a student dormitory 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in berets and moral relativism. Only now can I remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed and the countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons I can sum up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory is at its mildest a strenuous experience and at its worst a shocking one.
It's easy to get rambling in the situation: you tell everyone what you're about, whether you took a gap year and why, how you like Corbyn and why you don't "actually hate or love Marmite, because that's just yeast extract, hahaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask other people questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like and the people you wouldn't talk to even when your lashes were flaring up and these people were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give others space.
Private rooms often serve as drinking counters, movie theaters and public lounges, but a private room is also a place to dress up, starting with your underwear.
MORE: Don't Even Imagine Combining Dating and College Studies
College is a tough place for introverts.
Many dormitories, however, form a social culture in which you wander from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for someone who yearns for a place to recover.
In this environment, it's not possible to state, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out so I can recharge the energy I spent dating you."
Try to observe if one of your study friends is tired of social interaction. Maybe you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
There was a guy in my own student dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you're baking brownies and knocking on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50s, slightly odd case of, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I pry personalities from you."
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your study friends will be forced to talk to you. Thanks to a tasty surprise, they can be left with a positive image of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable baker skills.
If you're serving hapless lumps of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Waffling on food is also a common misdemeanor in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a splash of someone else's milk into your tea?
Always check with the owner of the milk carton.
You're likely to get the go-ahead, even if the milk quote yurts the can owner.
I understand that it’s annoying when someone gives you something, but try to handle it as adultly as possible – unlike my college friend, who poured detergent into her milk as punishment for milk thieves.
The woman is now in jail.
Don't make noise when others are trying to sleep or cringe.
Not only because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that for every other hole you dig...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the occupant of the next room to turn the music down, since it was 3 a.m., and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just turned up the volume.
When the neighboring room finally quieted down, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours for the exam, left the music blaring in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn’t it be strange if you first thought that your college friend was your future spouse, started dating, got divorced and had to see him every day, and lost the visitation rights of your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the student friend is definitely not the one, try to control your desire.
If you find in a crunching moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the line between pranking and bullying is more blurred than you might think.
A good prank is fun, but one you recover from in an instant.
Hiding an item can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be cluttered with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door to another room and drop the keys into a glass of water to put in the freezer, but don't attach anyone's belongings to the ceiling with a blue sticker more than a couple of times.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - House planned as reception centre was trashed in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on foreign students’ accommodation in Kitee, North Karelia, in the early hours of Saturday.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping quarters for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical People’s College of Kitee.
The windows and walls of the Folk High School's accommodations were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodations' windows, according to police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is in charge of youth social guarantee education at Kansanopisto, there were an estimated ten people in the building affected by the vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was the weekend and adult people are free to move around, so some might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The school houses people of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the embattled building has a-status.
Some are studying in an adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a breach of the domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here and no one has wanted to go away.
We have had more than a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkanen, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men are suspected to have been involved and were travelling in a light-coloured passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been defaced in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
It was reported by MTV on its website Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and the words "You are not welcome" were written in English.
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people who lived in the building.
State shuts down Y-train for Cattle - passengers snarled, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news outraged passengers boarding the early evening service of the train in question at Helsinki's main railway station.
In particular, the shutdown will hit Siuntio residents, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be down to nothing more than political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There will also be train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa region.
The H and R trains on the main line will be merged into a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will remain out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year deal, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved later by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio thinks that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that we have made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes the regret.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntioans, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further than the city area by train.
"It's specifically miserable for those who have to re-plan their journeys," he said as he pained his way onto the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the shoreline, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to estimate the cost accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, although the Ministry has paid much more than this.
On the main line, the incoming R line misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to operate in the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys will be made on the discontinued services per year, while the total number of journeys in the transport purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide the state with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in Marx's The Timeliness of Capital, to be published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s assessments of the development, internationalization and penetration of capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of financial capital and fictitious capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The list of authors of the book, which is based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever."
Surely the former CEO of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist?
Oh, no.
Korkman tells me over the phone that he doesn't think Marx is a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that a history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman nevertheless sees value in Marx’s radical stance.
"What's more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions," she says.
Now we are again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world changing as a result of technical upheaval," Korkman analyzes.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is of no help.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be put to rest.
Marx, however, is worth looking into.
"In the "70s, you couldn't read Marx," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx, too, can be approached without the ideological and political baggage of years past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as well as other classics," says Korkman.
U.N. calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The United Nations is calling for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, AFP news agency reports.
A U.N. report on the 1983-2009 civil war appeared Wednesday after a lengthy postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in Sri Lanka's civil war.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, a major offensive by the armed forces in the final months of a long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report insists.
The report accuses Sri Lanka's armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely to be men as women.
The rebels have been found guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded Wednesday that it plans to hold the inquiry itself but will not allow the creation of a U.N. tribunal because of foreign judges.
England's yo test allowed to punt on social media
The autumn matriculation examination was held on Wednesday in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 aspirants tested their English skills.
You could write a subject on social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250 word essay in English could be addressed to the keeper of the online magazine's advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the Finnish recliner of Leelia.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects to choose from.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses Mia Lybeck, a lecturer in English at Porvoo Swedish High School.
The third topic was just a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one, Lybeck said, was a good one.
It had to write an incendiary piece about why companies should hire young people for jobs.
"At least in our school, we've practiced speechwriting," Lybeck says, and rates the whole experiment "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English exam allowed you to answer questions about texts that reflected, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when it is the turn of another domestic test, i.e. the Swedish or Finnish test.
In upper secondary schools, the test is held normally, which means that the employees’ demonstration does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges aspirants to find suitable transport connections in time for the test session.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not caused by your own negligence.
Shop robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
A shop in Kello district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a commando beanie covering his face.
The man is of normal body and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and made off with a small amount of money.
The matter is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's cuts decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
As many as tens of thousands of people may arrive, according to preliminary data.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also believed to be taking part in the protest.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other policing, but also to ensure the smooth running of the gigantic demonstration.
Roads leading to Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles from around 9.30am to 2pm.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems enough is enough.
I do not take a stand on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols are coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland due to the demonstration.
The exact patrol numbers are not being reported by police.
"There's some way to go, but as a rule we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging people to avoid private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic slump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning until early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also many charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed on the railway.
Buses are initially very far away.
The rest of the way, you have to walk to the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration will also bring public transport in Helsinki to a standstill.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of smooth public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings, will now be taken care of by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the protest to go off peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
They are reasonable and calm people,” Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is extraordinary in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history,” says Martti Siisäinen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the union protested.
If it didn't, it would put hands up in front of the government," Siisiinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip on contract law is lacking.
There are a lot of reasons to try to bring the trade union movement to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration creates among those whom the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people gathered in different parts of Finland to demonstrate at Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, says Siisäinen.
Organised in the midst of the deepest recession, Breakthrough Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho’s (central) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
The relationship between the government and the union is perhaps even worse now than it was at the time of MurroThursday.
Besides, Finland’s toughest bourgeois government ever is now in power, Siisäinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in the way that it is so hard right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still some elements of the old Labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
Even if the protest does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it could become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have taken place in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful – even though the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict and are law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
But the late 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric strikes
The most important strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the metal workers' strike.
The strike was halted by a motion from the reconciliation board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metal men received a 16 per cent pay rise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Breakthrough Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered outside Parliament House, many made redundant by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed to the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in a rain of eggs as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignations ultimately spurred the negotiations to a result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - out of necessity," was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted five months and prompted a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors" salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student financial aid from Senate Square to Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
Central Bureau of Investigation investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Bureau of Investigation for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim, near the German border, with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck may have been on its way to Finland.
Those on the cold truck were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility are at the scene in Austria, according to Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria by lorry suffered more severe injuries.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by asphyxiation.
According to YLE, which first reported the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant and its CEO is a man of foreign background, aged about 40.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for human smuggling.
Refugee-busting captain, ex-drug courier and deep-pocketed businessman - the story of five smugglers
A wealthy kingpin of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a self-styled taxi driver.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book, Death Travel, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they show off the tentacles of human smuggling, offer suggestions for solutions and introduce smugglers from different parts of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
Kerkenna islands on Tunisia's eastern coast do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer getaways.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what the Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five deputies who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring huge numbers of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that the customers can just about stay alive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if a customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We go out on the water at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven to Lampedusa the following night.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves 20 feet high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and the Emir embarks on the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers-on to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one by the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from sub-Saharan Africa.
They say his countrymen are going to have to batter this one out for this one.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a normal taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter motor is pulling last and anyway it's seen its best days.
But the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed in.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families are housed in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, something that now anyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private residences, but that's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða region, a major hub for human smuggling, people are deathly tired.
Goran's rides are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran boasts.
He says Africans are trying to haggle.
That's not what Goran likes.
Go on, go on, go on, go on.
First, agree a price of, say, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," she says in the book.
Mr Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges just €50 a person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 100 miles away, most of it on a nice highway.
Colleagues, they say, are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns around €50,000 a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran ignores that: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rideshare riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and hurtles away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, which is frequented by a large number of believers who have fled Congo, as well as a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business, moving people from Congo to Europe.
He looks to do the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure the rubber band on the white underpants peeks elegantly from beneath the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, all-terrain vehicle and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organizing people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, stash your money wisely and slip into the traffickers across the border.
In order to qualify as an asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be told that you come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that you have been forced to flee your home to escape violence.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the Missionary arranges for the client to have a new identity.
The old identity card will be destroyed and a replacement will be provided.
That's where the Missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, managing documents for a humanitarian organization costs about 150 euros, and moving to a European country costs, for example, between 4,500 and 7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks bound for Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, as well as dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the people-smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver would pick up their customers, usually two to three people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They are driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's already done seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the Brits.
Tom picks a suitable truck - we have to make sure it's headed just for England rather than, say, Holland - and cuts across the safety wire of the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in on it, but it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should stop the police heat scanner from spotting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping the driver won't snap up the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous people smugglers in the world.
The uppish Turk has been called a master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, controlling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scheme: chartered yachts from Turkish ports supposedly take U.S. or European families on comfortable few-day tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who, for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000, are transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once that's given, you've got to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of the crowd in sight.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about €53,000 after expenses for one luxury ship trip.
He does not handle the practicalities himself but hires captains, recruiters, security guards, hosts and other smaller factors to handle the jobs on his behalf.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land through front companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 flats he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 along with a member of parliament from the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he appears to have disappeared.
Correction 16 September 2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
In her book, the American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
A new book by 1,500m runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and drifting into prostitution.
Sports Illustrated magazine published excerpts from the book Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the Games in top form and ran the second best time in qualifying.
But in the finale, he panicked.
He stormed to the top at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
But 150 metres before the finish, his powers were depleted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was overtaken one after another by other competitors.
I felt like an idiot and thought, I'm never going to run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line," Favor Hamilton recounts in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt huge pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems but were fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a life of luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he craved the same kind of adrenaline boosts he had received when competing in athletics.
It later emerged to Favor Hamilton that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000 she was world number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3:57.40 but was last in the Sydney Olympic final.
World champion overjoyed as union clamps down on Norwegian ski rooster: 'Direct-backed'
Norway's ski king Petter Northug has overstepped the bounds of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wrangling throughout the summer and fall, as they did last year, over an athlete contract.
While the federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, even that hasn't been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of their contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision drew praise from two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for showing backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The row between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he's happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and won't let one athlete go solo.
At the same time, he reminded that the union has given Northug financial as well as other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just for being the best.
Northug issued a statement of his own on Tuesday, asserting that he wanted to sport Norway's colours next season at the World Cup as well as afterwards at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six world championship medals in her career overall, including two golds.
He was part of the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
The Day of the Bake Turners is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. day, 25 September, there will be stunts in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the S.H.I.E.L.D. plate.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality expertise in the food sector and to lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the significance of a plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but that there are top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organised at Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town participates in shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the most significant international events organised on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-magazine: Kauhava reception centre has been opened for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-operating to establish a refugee reception centre at the Kauhava ex-Varuskunta premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure is still permanently located in the area during the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and their partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to the private person, placing the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area of the former Air Force Academy and the airport, the impact of which has also not been determined in the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
For the last two years, negotiations have taken place on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy, among others.
A private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern a principled objection to the reception centre, but that the planned site in the former garrison area is wrong.
The city of Kauhava’s city government dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters at nightfall after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we have big challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed.
On the labour market situation, the president did not take a position.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight is already cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that during the work stoppage, the airport operations will be managed by supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Protest closes streets of Helsinki city centre
The protest on Friday will close streets in central Helsinki.
Police say streets leading to Railway Square will be closed to cars from about 9.30am to 2pm.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police said the lockdown period would depend on the number of people attending the protest.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
Metro and streetcar drivers in all-out protest Friday
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from the start of morning services to the end of night services.
The Tram and Metro Staff Association told STT this evening.
Majority of Alkos closes for two hours, including post offices closed
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruption to Post Office services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
The majority of postal service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross transports blood despite the strike.
Efforts are also being made to handle meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information about the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam, the service sector trade union, has instructed its workers to stop work between 11am and 1pm.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to take part in a demonstration by trade unions.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores will be kept open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
The day-care centres in Helsinki will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education informs.
Due to a protest by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and there will be no club activities in day care centres and playgrounds.
Round-the-clock kindergartens, as well as groups of mentally disabled and multi-disabled children, will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be held as normal.
The Department for Early Childhood Education will announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s speeches on television and radio are one channel among others.
This kind of direct-talk channel will also be needed in the future.
It won’t be the last time, he told reporters.
He did not want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches would become a frequent occurrence.
According to Sipilä, the speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then we'll see.
“We’re going to use that channel tonight,” he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires giving television and radio speeches to citizens.
What we are talking about here is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up with this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech does not indicate a more general inward turn of the government.
Is the intention to take the right to define public debate more firmly into one’s own hands and refuse to be asked questions in the public debate?” says Professor Anu Koivunen from Stockholm University.
It reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media’s agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policymakers are not matters of notice in a democracy.
By definition, it is the job of media representatives to try not to take politicians" agendas as givens.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more on offer today that we've already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a grand gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
It is also a risk if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as the media of politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or general policy.
A sneaky bet from Sipilä
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, the TV talk is a clever move by Sipilä, because this way he can express his own views without the use of gravel sounds.
This will provide a large audience for the message without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a news conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
They ignore the media and speak directly to the people.
There is a risk, however, that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - does the sweat drip, do the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If your pet can do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform about something, because here it is as if the person is speaking directly to the other person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack) Obama and associates do on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to citizens to be truly exceptional.
He says it hasn't happened for decades that the prime minister speaks directly to the people.
Extraordinary time requires extraordinary means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Workers' organisations are holding a protest and strikes against the government's actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can’t hide forever from Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Texas.
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
THE BOY IS FOUND AND FINE," the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The National Police Department also confirmed this.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he could not be contacted again.
Dad thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
Finnish UFC star disillusioned by youngster’s violent craze: You’re generating hate
Makwan Amirkhani, an MMA fighter from a Kurdish background, posted a video on Facebook with special appeal to young people from an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a weighty speech against street fighting by youths.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both his professional fights in mixed martial arts' most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the craze for young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on each other and punching without thinking about the consequences of this, what happens when you make videos like this.
Hard to justify anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police’s Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fight videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
It's the fact that you're basically fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani points out that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageously numerous.
A little difficult, boys, no more excuses for you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a while.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to someone's racism, then you have yourself to blame.
Think about this a couple of times before you go along with it, guys.
Amirkhani says violent action gives stakes to racism.
You make me hate people I don’t like either.
You've got things pretty bad anyway and that way you're not going to improve them at all," Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, President of SAK, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would submit its own proposal to the Government to achieve the five per cent leap in productivity demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
But it would require the largest employee organisation, SAK, to soften its previous stance.
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, made a terse comment on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK's working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, agreements made by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to the SAK.
Earlier, Sipilä broke off negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five per cent productivity leap.
Commentary: A big protest threatens to fall flat - "It feels a bit funny to shake your fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from camp to camp.
Is it to call out the government or to agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK exuded holy hatred towards the government of the republic.
The whole country was threatened with arrest.
The threat spread to the Akava people.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened the closure of schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK, appeared conciliatory.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a five per cent leap in productivity.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hastened to announce immediately that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, there was no sign of the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to agree when union leaders just on Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that SAK's bureau would meet next Monday to address the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labor market lock."
In order for a collective proposal to be made by employees, SAK should accept a productivity leap of 5% as a target.
It is no wonder that the Fire Department has a strong relationship with the government.
Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s head of public affairs, was previously special assistant to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that the government’s expertise in trade unions has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, Palola’s exit took a bit of a breather from the Finnish stoppers, who are fronted by ACP’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia slammed as bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the jubilee meeting in Helsinki in July.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union's sanctions list, to attend the meeting - an issue about which the Speaker kept reminding journalists.
Our assessment was that it went against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also barred from entering.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation was able to reach Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued Finland’s efforts by praising and thanking Mongolia for its “excellent organization”.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should have no obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator, and according to Russian media, he has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
Lock faces real playoff troll: 'Goals tight'
The two of them are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Last night, they won a 3-2 victory.
The rise was manly as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
The Blues, who started with a tangled start, had a round of zero points, and a loss of 2-3.
Tough game, goals tight, if any play the same kind of game as last year, Lukko striker Janne Lahti anticipates setups on the club's side.
It has turned into a playoff nightmare.
After all, in the past two seasons, Tappara has just dropped a lock from the final series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been called for.
Last season, Lock took the series to a halt already in the fourth game, but Tappara stepped up in the next three alongside and passed.
With the exception of the goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flutter today.
With Tappara's goal Mika Noronen makes way for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A miserable play under way in the Aces
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put up a fight for world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, despite eventually losing the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a disturbing Cinderella story for Pori.
To everyone's amazement, the anonymous and wood-handed pot pack progressed to the SM-finals 2006.
The team was filled with anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, a Porin Mattia and a Pele Peltonen.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
She turned blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver won.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season’s novelty piece will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for aces has built a cauldron on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pummeling dudes in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie in something other than puckish play.
Toivola has forgotten that the main character in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has christened Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead actor in Toivola’s screenplay Rocky as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's nothing more Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
Iron Rock's playing philosophy doesn't include rushing and little hogs.
He appreciates playing hard, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen to the head.
She got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We play only those who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game and it's not part of ace hockey," the hot-tempered Rautakallio snapped at the Satakunta People after the game.
The team of aces this season is oddly constructed.
There are trains, there are veterans, there are cops, there are healers.
There are virtually no key men in prime playing age.
No wonder the head coach has bemoaned the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited,” Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's smouldering beneath the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The balance of aces in the season's three league games is the same number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
I don't think it would have been worth it to write a sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting under the guidance of her husband for the first time.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the film.
In a way, it seems crazy," actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna’s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka’s direction for the first time.
Olga's role in 'You made us beautiful' is drummer Sipe Santapukki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my true role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to become to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Cricket before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone and messaged.
Cricket has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Cricket also thankfully understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be coloured a bit.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
Back in the '90s, it was a recession and really dreary.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before the film plans.
But the parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yes, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, then how much do your parents really know what you were up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, who is known as the notorious skater of Heinola.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At best, he could have secretly delighted.
According to Olga, she has collaborated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a big joint project.
It's always worked out super well.
Now the whole production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often also plans to drive home at night because the distance is not too far.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a really warm welcome, just asking which streets to clear and when.
Iron Sky 2 becomes the most expensive play film in Finland
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film ever with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 as the film has a budget of more than €100 million.
Filming for the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is going to Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare you.
I have been so sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the public.
The original budget for the film was 8-10 million, but as the script was developed, the budget increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story, too.
But you could stuff 100 million into a movie because every angle and effects is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there's not a single loose end.
Iron Sky Universe, the film's production company, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond today on Wednesday, paying an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Hicks or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' busts have recently been adorned with big logos.
Not so long ago, the fashion-savvy dresser avoided plain and bulky logos like Crocs for ever.
Advertising a brand of hoodie or T-shirt was seen as somewhat of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is a blur: if something is already right hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of a grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cupboard is now placed on top, with the manufacturer’s logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable tracksuits, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps, for example, have also made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend appears to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, Versace's autumn blouse bust makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Are you ready to show off your logos?
The Russian politician posted the proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank hatch!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015, which showcases products of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have circulated in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations had to remove the large-sized Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he seems to be peering through the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least based on those images, it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's absolute nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, a lieutenant colonel, having served in the Urals.
I went inside there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Speaking to the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he admired the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
And out I came through the trunk,' he said.
I went in all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also slammed the journalist who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was none of that.
I went in, and I came out.
I am tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are backed up by the fact that no photographs of the alleged jam have been released, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show over the course of a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with a story on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov reportedly struggled to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organisers gave their take on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armoured vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his bulky stature, simply lingered when he came out.
But by no means did he sit there for five hours," Aleksandr Pisarevski, the exhibition's coordinator, told Bloknot.

The candelabra of the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was in the first place.
The architect brothers have been known to refine the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the Lords.
Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the illustrious brothers.
The candlesticks are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candle versions, in four different colours.
Kubus is available in black, white, nickel and copper.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
Refined process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings basin into a ditch.
The company said steps have been taken to fix the leak.
The basin contains neutralized tailings and purified process water from the flotation process.
Usually, the water is pumped either to be reused as process water or to be discharged to the environment via a surface drainage field.
The leak was estimated at about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company said the quality of the leaked water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material was spilled into the environment.
The leak was discovered during a round of inspections on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the basin.
The company said it is working closely with authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danske's Pitfalls: IMF Warns Against Cutting Too Much
Finland’s country report published today by the International Monetary Fund largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to implement comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
The IMF said that reducing overtime pay and paid days off would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed to the entire treaty system as well as unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of message in the IMF's assessment that is sympathetic to the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4 per cent for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In its new forecast for the economic cycle, Danske predicts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis of the latest sightings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention may again have been paid to weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer metrics.
However, there are only a few percentage differences.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new director
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima comes as no great surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, told Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but in such a way that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional games consoles.
More and more asylum seekers are arriving in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children were missing every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of underage applicants disappear in Sweden every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
In 2013, 156 asylum applications were made for unaccompanied minors in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it becomes clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing are also found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3,651, of which 134 applications were closed because the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of September 6, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on underage asylum seekers missing this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to have an impact on the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about the converts?
Will they also disappear into the 'dark labour market', for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of deportation decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action on the matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at a meeting of EU interior ministers, on Monday outlined practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media industry who has lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Nina Mikkonen, Mikkonen’s spouse, sells equipment on Huuto.net that was once the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The online advert was first reported by the online newspaper Ilmatakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment has been overtaken by technological advances.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes will no longer be filmed.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident there will be some interested parties.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts – collectors and builders of their own studios, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkonens are looking to move out of their current Myrskylan home.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've been slowly starting to take stock and see which items to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for television or radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to the workforce.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s real life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives picked up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get porridge worse than thought: Metro and trams could stop all day Friday
Metro and streetcar drivers will decide today whether to extend the force in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt subway and streetcar service only during the rally on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be determined whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief steward Pekka Hirvonen says the ooh is big on the field.
The cuts to night and shift allowances will severely sting drivers, so the Government's plans to cut the allowances will provoke opposition.
Hirvonen ponders that stopping traffic for an entire day is a kind of dilemma, however.
If the metro and trams come to a standstill on Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be almost completely at a standstill.
VR reports that trains will not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses will remain in the depot.
ACP members are off work Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of the buses can be driven, they will be driven by supervisors,” says Pirkko Repo, spokesperson for HSL.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employees’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, according to the Associated Press.
Sky News reports that refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled amid panic.
According to local media reports, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas after teacher mistook self-made watch for bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought a homemade watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News he just wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers wore a watch that looked just like a bomb.
Police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile holding cell.
At no time has Mohamed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said officers had determined the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is in police custody but was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another manifestation of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK uproar over Labour leader's refusal to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism from the right-leaning press has also been echoed by MPs from Mr Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the nation, thought Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with broadcaster BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined in the song.
Yesterday's commemoration honoured the battle of the British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, Labour defends Mr Corbyn and stresses he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroics of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully in silence during the national anthem," the statement stressed.
Mr Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour ranks.
Among MPs in particular, there are those who fear he will deter moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity and increased public spending.
Mr Corbyn is today due to make his first appearance as party leader in Parliament during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron took to Twitter this week to announce Corbyn's election as party leader.
Labour is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families," the prime minister tweeted on his own account.
Minnesota Family Killing Cause Still Unclear as Family's Father Faces Lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a soon-to-be weeklong family slaying in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed the gunman was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After firing a shotgun at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the home.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns were raised about the absence of children at the school.
Based on this report, officers went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead in various parts of the huge house.
StarTribune said it was possible the victims had been dead for days.
Million Dollars and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors weekly.
I have had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the business, but not yet.
Among other successes, the Short family bought a swanky house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house not only has 12 rooms, but also a garage adequate for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
But according to StarTribune, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, over comments on AllNurses.com.
Achieve Test Prep said there had been no defamatory comments about prep courses removed from Short's site and, consequently, they had lost customers to their rivals.
But according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have made much difference to Short's business.
Vesku Loiri
In addition, the trio were awarded with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award.
This is a great idea, Loiri commented with good cheer on his honour board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and earned 100,000 euros with the win.
Artist legend Loiri was still baffled by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse's trainer, Korpi, will have full labor peace while working with the horse, according to Loiri.
Peter decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri blubbered.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The biggest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital statement, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising efforts for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's endowment is significantly higher than his annual earnings of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
It's not the first time Canadiens players have significantly helped local hospitals.
Longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, for example, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order your wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening, and she will serve the food wearing only a bikini and an apron.
Coffee shops are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a cuddle cafe and now a wife cafe on the market.
It hits the lonely, the companion-hungry and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
At Ore no Yome (My Wife) in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
This is a waiter pretending to be the customer's spouse.
The "spouse" is chosen from a list before entering the cafe and prepares and serves the food.
The wife is met with nothing but a apron and a bikini, the husband again in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about wife candidates, from height and weight to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be prepared for
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry,” Intel said in a statement.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security testing and inspections with the goal of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update the report based on the ASRB's research findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
By the same estimate, 60 to 75 percent of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars,” said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish security-related best practices and supports the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around €52,000 in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been waiting for years like it's going up on the moon.
The car is finally on the horizon in Finland.
Ford announced the RS at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new all-wheel-drive RS, thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
What is also interesting in Finnish terms is the price, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available for order, although the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Kia introduced two new models at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly the most important of the two innovations in Finland, with which Kia intends to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created in the shape of a new European design leader, Gregory Guillaume, the Sportage is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and exterior dimensions have become one centimetre here and there and the car is splitting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo developing 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to going on sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, new Kia Optimats arrived in Finland.
It doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
Start with Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
Around the same time as its arrival, sales of the Optima station wagon will begin.
Chisu returned to the stage - blared in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is participating in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a showy, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the singer star's graceful waist.
The crown of the ensemble is a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during a three-year hiatus, has shed the pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from the new record in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn't really thrill me.
I’ve missed all the music, the singer said.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his fourth album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired me to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Stuns Again - Now You Can See Her Breast
Reality TV beau Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She generously shows off her pregnancy belly and cleavage in sexy clothes, most recently last night at 1am American time when she and sister Kourtney Kardashian exited husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-coloured bra underneath the dress as flashbulbs flicker.
The last time Kardashian donned an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she stopped by a friend's house for a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The outfit was accentuated by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last week's Friday, when a pregnancy belly was on show.
Tough Laws of the Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to short-circuit the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths off about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you've posed in top designers' outfits in the previous season, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season there are new, fresh faces entering the industry, competing for jobs with the old-timers.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
Work is constant travel and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you're very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to shed the pounds, but in Paris, they'll then say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risky game all the time.
At Fashion Week, models and designers are together all the time, and act as a support network at the same time.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is wistful.
Models want to enter this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just about showcasing clothes.
Models want to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a big challenge for me, because I’m about to turn 26 as a rap artist, and in this film I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of the group, so I think it’s good that I’m only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to do an impersonation of a person.
Scrooge Salminen and the man who leads the Dogs will not play the role.
Punk mannerisms come naturally to a man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw a preview, as well if you've ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything small, we always go full throttle.
Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, directed the main actors of the film Teit Us Beautiful.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is played to the general public by young actors who are still fairly unknown.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his upcoming job already last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a moustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: Here's how to tell kids about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to inform their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, advises SPR crisis team member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they are seeing, and it can stick in the mind and become distressing, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news footage of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is a good idea to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
A child’s fears can be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones a parent imagines she's afraid of.
There is no point in intimidating a child, even if you are distressed and frightened.
Younger children closely monitor the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Older children are more likely to come across conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to bring up the matter with them if the child is thinking about it.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Together with the children, parents can consider how this will be viewed in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe place or a safe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult issues, the child will get a model for how to deal with the difficulties that come up in life.
This may be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
Their own strength at an end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Vermo-hitting ball lightning hard to contain
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone in on Pallosalama’s impact in mid-summer.
It was only a victory and a second place finish until the end of July when the Tampere Races collapsed.
Because the stallion was thoroughly congealed, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown became clear on the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but required two courses of medication.
Since Apila’s Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says he was pleasantly surprised by the horse’s recent run.
It was the second time in its record-breaking time in Turku after the SE mare Taruntuuli.
He was under a lot of pressure when he could drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that proper competition made the studs edge.
The horse's momentum certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have plateaued as well.
Clover's Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not amused, it can be thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, by contrast, the stallion has been dislodged by such a lightning rush that opponents have been in awe.
In short speed, fellow racers are no match for the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
There is hope for the north in Vermo.
What is different, however, is how Clover's Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's pretty hard when you're starting out and you might even pull out from under the boom of the starting car and things like that.
I hope it’s calmer than going down.
The clover ball lightning can also come from the bow when it is in good condition, and we will drive it for the win, the coach promises.
Here's why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, according to Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
You'll find a host of programs on Apple's iPhone that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newsstands, Health, the Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind, for example.
The latest addition to those programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a must-have update for iPhone handsets, though it's only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook said removing Apple's programs is a more complicated issue than it appears on the top.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook notes to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work solidly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them," Cook added.
So Cook said Apple is looking into it, saying the company doesn't want to waste memory space from users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation eases to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the eurozone rose only marginally, or 0.1 per cent year-on-year, in August, Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority, said today.
The rise in prices was dragged down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised down its preliminary estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 percent.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9 percent in August from 1.0 percent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate of core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the eurozone last month than a year ago.
Across the 28-nation EU as a whole, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
July saw a 0.1 percent rise.
Of the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, by 1.4 per cent, in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a price rise of around 2 per cent over the medium term.
The ECB is forecasting an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the eurozone for this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 percent, the central bank anticipated in its new inflation forecasts released in early September.
U.S. Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next U.S. recession will begin at its fastest pace in less than a year, but with more certainty within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, steps in to raise its interest rates again.
And in financial markets, meanwhile, the downgrade will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted at possibly starting rate hikes as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
This means that the next recession could hit us at its fastest by next autumn and the course of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that will be the case if the world's largest economy and financial markets perform as they have been wont to do - and if they react to the Fed's monetary taps tightening as they have in the past.
Such conclusions have been reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, strategists at Deutsche Bank London market research, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed the more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report don't pretend to know when exactly the Fed will move to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets after that.
Instead, they present economic statistics using cool facts and their calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved in the past at the time of and after the Fed's rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another pattern as at the time of previous rate increases - and what might come of it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in shakier shape to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year into the recession.
Throughout last summer and early autumn, leaders deciding on the Fed's monetary policy and its respective stance have hinted that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years could come as soon as this week.
The issue will be resolved over the course of Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's board's so-called open market committee meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of exactly two years of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage point rate hikes by the Fed to raise its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market's symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the riskiest U.S. housing finance, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time around, the severe adversity in financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically been the case since previous Fed rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and harsher than at any time since the Depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have sifted through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the twists and turns of financial markets since 1950 and, in some places, since the early 19th century.
They make sense of the Fed's rate hikes and their economic and fiscal impact since the 1950s.
It has been less than a year since the first rate hike, usually less than three years and less than three and a half years on average.
The rise in financial markets has ended within a year-two of the Fed's rate hikes starting.
The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has differed from the others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the examination, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent rate increases.
The strategists remind us that this time around, many things are different.
And not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be conclusively identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat indisputably clear:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the eurozone ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the marks of the tech bubble, while growing the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and which was already too high, became even greater due to the over-loose monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in history.
3) In particular, the crazy cheap debt financing that packed into the financial economy almost without restraint swelled the biggest exchange rate bubbles in most parts of the financial markets to date, from equities to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor is it likely to generate very severe controversy that financial markets, which have soared to heights on increasingly convoluted leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile spot the last time the Fed and other central banks drove up interest rates.
Financial structures rigged with debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last more than their time after rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned upwards.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis, followed by the Great Recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not speculate on what will happen next, but they do give some reason to wonder, for example by mentioning the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economies has not eased, but now there is a much heavier debt load in different parts of the economy than before the financial crisis or at any time before it.
3) More liquid and cheaper than before, central bank liquidity has largely remained in the financial markets and has curbed key securities and assets to their most expensive levels since the pre-financial crisis peak or at any time.
And not only are strategists flattening the mood with warning signs from financial markets, they also point out that even the U.S. economy has yet to recover from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades to the pattern that has transpired in the past.
The eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
The real economy, in other words, is in unusually weak shape but correspondingly the pressures and risks in financial markets are incomparably greater than they were before the financial crisis, when the Fed next moves to tighten its monetary taps tighter.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, strategist at Societe Generale, the French bank, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a good while, he has been grooming the bank's international investor clients for the Fed's following turnarounds:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it will be time for the Fed to race to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which makes computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The vast majority of the reductions will be in HP's business services side, the company said.
HP is splitting into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on enterprise sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers for consumers, in November.
HP's headcount peaked in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company will record non-recurring charges of $2.7bn (about €2.4bn) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise to shed 25,000-30,000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already rebalanced its business so that none of its customers accounts for more than 10 percent of its operating results.
Last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 per cent of EBIT.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a board member of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
The company in question is the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he submitted a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked it out and that's enough for me to have filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings pass through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to ensure that the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from Finnish companies’ capital is taxed in Finland, and this starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for the holdings.
A reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
Espoo’s Otaniemi will open the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to welcome the first 100 residents from 6pm today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre at the former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares alternative labour blackmail package
STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package to the government's labour blackmails.
The organization also hopes to include other employee center organizations.
Chairman Antti Palola says the focus is currently on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the price of labour will then be revisited.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break in the administration meeting of the organization.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not ready for discussions.
Economists at STTK have calculated that the change security included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the other half of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a huge amount of interest on the part of the party in having a conversation if you're getting a one-to-one ratio of 100.
Palola: Negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
He did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the Government is there, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, the personnel centre organisation STTK, cutting Sunday supplements in the field is a sore spot.
The organization requires the government to back away from compelling legislation to carry out some of the extortion.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm to the possibility of preparing an alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government's extortion package for working life presented last week.
As part of the package, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be cut back.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, commends STTK’s announcement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now joining forces with Akava, as an alternative model for the government’s proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not comprehensive enough.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palolan STTK said it was preparing new proposals.
We want transformational security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5 percent jump in competitiveness as an alternative to the cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want transformational security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without it, the package is not strong enough.
We will now work together to create a model that suits the government and employers,” Fjäder says.
Akava's bureau will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, let's walk" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
The University of Tampere’s Green Left’s Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given speeches on exceptions during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will address the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels at 9.05 pm on Wednesday evening.
When applying for a similar speech by the Prime Minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he made the famous radio address that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators’ strike with a television address.
Solitary, monarchical
All day long, the speech has been a source of criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Greens, “I’ve already seen the monotony.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months from the elections.
Not a single appearance from the prime minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is @Juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it will be commented on live television by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
He has been criticized for giving a speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity that covers the whole of Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle’s publications at Yle News.
Like We Were in Tammeloita
The speech has also provoked taunts.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest colt and my dad matches the tie to his neck.
At nine o'clock we will be silenced in front of the television as before in the time of the Tammelots," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä will also explain why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they must cut back when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has posted an accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear tonight about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Vouchers and pens ready, 9.05pm it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western nations reject Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rebuffed a Russian offer to dislodge Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari has told the Guardian.
Ahtisaari said Russia's U.N. ambassador proposed a plan to give al-Assad an elegant step down from power after some time.
But Western countries did not take up the suggestion because they believed al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Vitali Churkin listed three plans in a bilateral discussion: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted, and al-Assad’s departure from power had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats won't comment
Ahtisaari says he conveyed Churkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the conversation to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
U.N. diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deal to keep him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East department at the British Foreign Office, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari is saying because, in his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin spoke under Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about what Churkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Even in that case, Jenkins said, he would have suspected it was Putin's gimmick to keep power with some supporter of al-Assad.
A refugee stream of our own making
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the start of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying a bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
Asylum seeker settlements in Tornio
A centre for organising asylum seekers, planned by the Government for northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty Tornio joint lyceum building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to the vice-president of the Tornio City Council, Sauli Hyöppinen (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not meeting and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a meeting of the council for next Monday to decide on the matter.
Thirty-six of the 43 delegates were present at the debate.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, one would expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city was contacted about the issue on Monday, and the response was swift.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint lyceum at any one time.
An expert has gone to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), the halving of public holiday allowances would take care of only part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the Government.
But he said the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations managed to agree on one.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the labor clampdowns announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, halving the holiday allowance would work as a means, because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday bonuses.
The labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday pay, because it is enshrined in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday of next week, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
He said the organization’s proposals should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
This is when the legislative work starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more and more difficult.
It's very time.
It doesn’t take long for this to happen, if you have the will to do it.
The government's list, published last week, includes turning Epiphany and Ascension into unpaid days off without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be cut short.
The reforms will be implemented as compelling legislation past the unions, which has drawn strong criticism.
In addition to a large demonstration on Friday, several labor unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves expansion of the sap hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but slightly grumbled about the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s warehouse.
What caused the criticism was that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
A busy schedule also snarled.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of 150,000-200,000 euros on the agenda, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated price would be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous stance to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right for the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more a part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing, with good consideration given to each case.
The City recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be treated with open-mindedness now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still unique in the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be useful in many areas of marketing.
Train closures cut province's vitality
The cuts to train services will hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that has an impact on whether we can live and work here at all,” says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raised the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been discussed on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that we do not reduce our chances by measures taken by the state, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these closures, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, President of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that already at the moment, marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult, because the cross-border connections are weak.
Currently, about half of the University of Eastern Finland’s students come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sounds for Siun sote
The Joensuu City Board’s view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel voice among them.
City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured) proposed at Monday’s meeting that the entire project be abandoned, but his proposal fell unsupported.
The Government approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meets, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, albeit less than one train service.
Passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola will be changed next March.
One train service is cancelled, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail traffic purchase funds for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be discontinued altogether.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped away from the scene
Emergency services released a 12-year-old who climbed onto the roof from the climb and was unable to get down on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
That didn't stop a group of boys who decided to climb up to the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
Other boys made it down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that others slipped from the scene and passers-by alerted the emergency services to help pull the last person on the roof safely back down to earth.
FedEx revenue fluctuates, lower outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx announced its weak results for the latest quarter. The transportation giant downgraded its full-year profit forecast due to lower demand for freight services and increased ground transportation costs.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in the 45 minutes before actual trading opened Wednesday.
FedEx forecasts $10.40-$5.90 for the fiscal year ending in May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
According to a survey by FactSet, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite price increases of 4.9 percent on average for the rate. The increases will take effect on January 4. Additional fees for ground transportation of heavy or large-sized shipments will take effect in November.
The company still expects earnings growth from the previous year, thanks to cost cuts, higher revenue and e-commerce growth.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, noted that the company has performed well in the weaker-than-expected economic climate, which has hit production and global trade particularly hard.
Plans to hire seasonal workers were announced the day after rival UPS announced plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, between 90,000 and 95,000 people.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx posted an operating profit of $692 million, a rise of six percent.
Earnings per share were $2.42. So that fell short of the $2.44 forecast by 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose five percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research said revenue was expected to be 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, leaving the company's Express unit stagnant.
Strong growth in e-commerce has bolstered FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the net sales of ground transportation increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit delivered better returns thanks to higher base charges, while earnings from the freight business fell due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before opening of actual trading, FedEx's stock was down $3.85 or 2.5 percent at $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended up down 11 percent from the year's average and 17 percent below the highest quotation recorded on June 11.
This week, policymakers at the Federal Reserve are gathering for the most anticipated meeting in years. A crowd sits down at an eight-foot-diameter Honduran wooden table to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's ornate, two-story conference room stands a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Speaker Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the state's economic interest above all other interests.
The central bank has a double provision from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
Since the Great Depression, however, the central bank's leadership has noted a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
That mandate could be the missing piece of a tortuous decision. On Thursday, the central bank is due to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to begin weaning off the unforeseen stimulus provided by short-term interest rates that stayed near zero from late 2008.
While most of the data shows the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in financial markets may have officials at the already cautious Federal Reserve spooked into adding to the volatility by raising the benchmark federal tax rate – even by a percentage point in a quarter.
"The labor market and inflation are obviously first and foremost in their hands-on monitoring," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the banking firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in global markets is enough to warrant a further wait," Piegza continues.
Those who have thought about it don't agree on what the central bank is up to, which in itself is causing nervousness.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg fumed about rising interest rates this week.
But financial markets think the central bank is waiting, with only a 30 per cent chance of a drawdown, according to the key indicator.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices could fall unless policymakers soften the blow by promising another drawdown.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average leapt 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The glimmer was driven by expectations that the central bank will hold a key interest rate steady this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank were to raise the rate at this point," he noted.
"If that were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets from shaking."
Experts on the other, meanwhile, noted that raising interest rates could calm financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago, the central bank appeared to be leaning toward raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month. It would be the first small step in tightening financing conditions and, by extension, bolstering the U.S. recovery.
Throughout the spring and early summer, Yellen has stated that she expected to raise interest rates this year – despite the fact that liberals say economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month. Its level is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level the central bank puts at full employment.
Payrolls look to pick up
While inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2 percent targets, central bank policymakers noted that a key reason for this is the sharp temporary impact on oil prices.
"The economy can make do with higher interest rates and it needs them as long as they take into account the tight situation in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were not startled last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled as much as 16 percentage points from May's record high and investors feared China's economic decline would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and the Dow Jones is now down nearly 10 percent since peaking in May.
The turmoil in the markets means that central bank policymakers are getting even more complicated in their consideration of a key interest rate hike.
"The central bank's work is getting more complicated, despite what happened in the financial markets and the news that has come out about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official, noted.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the impact.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable data on the situation following the recent development of the Chinese economy," Oliner noted.
Restoring the global economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not influence the central bank's decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank is the world's most influential monetary body.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
In 2013, the mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow the scope of its operations prompted upheaval around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to engage with other central banks and experts to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science," Zachary Karabell, senior vice president for global strategy at fund management firm Envestnet Inc., noted.
Chairman Jeffrey Lacker of the Richmond Regional Central Bank noted this month that the central bank has in the past overreacted to moves in financial markets that don't seem to have a connection to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for raising the key interest rate, citing the 1998 and 1999 decisions as an example.
"The Asian financial crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to cut the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, despite the limited availability of identifiable sanctions for economic growth in the United States," Lacker told me.
A year later, the central bank reversed that decision.
"The central bank should put monetary stability first only in a significant crisis, such as the 2008 financial meltdown," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't even approximate the situation at the time," he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to fear an interest rate hike because of market shocks," Posen, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and makes no mention of monetary stability. Until there is a change to this, I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazil's Rio Grande Association of Pediatricians promotes proper diets for those who breastfeed
Brazil's Rio Grande Association of Pediatricians (SPRS) has developed a shocking way to teach breastfeeding women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies being breast-fed on which pictures of unhealthy food are painted.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This way, the baby gets all the nutrition it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calorie intake, other dietary changes should be made.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers despite Nine trying to clinch the lead with its Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson raced to Canberra to do a morning programme about the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, however, which did little to boost Today's ratings.
Nine's morning programme was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The morning show on the rival channel, piloted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London. The programme's week-long specials will also be broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The spacing apparently didn't matter to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise watching an average of 397,000 in five state capitals, followed by Today at 339,000.
Today's ratings were up slightly on last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but fell short of last Thursday's reading (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 viewers, Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far averaged 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

A major novelty on Seven was the 800 Words novelty series, which features former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novelty drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to star in the hit show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the response is decidedly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 viewers. The show brightly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captivated viewers to varying degrees.
An average of 446,000 viewers watched the first half-hour of the new quiz series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00 to 5.30).
The second half-hour (17.30-17.00) saw 623,000 viewers, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, with the second half attracting a staggering 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat's viewership was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night's ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will go past another 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

Sam Wood is the Bachelor of Dreams, but who will he choose?
Was the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski, perhaps inadvertently, revealed the pick of the Bachelor of Dreams.
The ultimate choice for Bachelor of Dreams Sam Wood has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women won't say a word about who got the last rose from the bachelor.
We quizzed the moods of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before dribble one out of the trio. The women may have inadvertently hinted at who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are firmly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women raved that Wood was the perfect man. The women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity and considered him a partner befitting his qualities.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the final rose did not fall on their own, their answers can give an indication of who will take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Everything has gone smoothly between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood from day one.
"As soon as I got to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were a good fit. This feeling has been maintained throughout the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, and she's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good pair.
Mackay said he realized during last week's hometown date that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him around my friends and family, I understood that this is not just a race. I am now putting the fullest effort into our relationship," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should pick if he didn't pick her, the woman answered enigmatically:
"I can't tell," he said.
"I like the other girls equally. Snezana and Lana are evenly matched."
Bachelor of Dreams airs on Ten on Wednesday at 7.30pm.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were keen on Hayne after he moved to the US. Several other clubs were also keen on the man after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice appears to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as happened to the man with the Australian rugby team. Hayne fumbled a fly kick return situation after the team took the win Tuesday over Minnesota by 20-3.
But Tomsula showed his confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return a fly-out. The coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He didn't clobber rookies in front of the rest of the team but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reports Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the botched catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles a catch, during the first quarter of a game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his legions of Australian fans had expected otherwise from the man's NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field with a grudge and later told 2DayFM 104.1 channel's Hamish and Andy that he couldn't have imagined a more miserable start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and you have to move on," Hayne noted.
Hayne compared the error to his debut State of Origin series in 2007 when his pass in his own area opened up a place for Queensland.
Still, on the whole, the experience was incredible for the 27-year-old youngster.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram of him posing along with fans and an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.

Four dead after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, an official source said on Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd during a protest against the country's alleged new constitution. A four-year-old boy was among the victims.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh district, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital, Katmandu.
District chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing rocks and firebombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It's not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which yes can kill but are generally seen as a less destructive option, suddenly were this deadly.
It was the latest clash in weeks of protests in Nepal's southern plains, where the Madhesi tribe says new provinces based on a new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe claims its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent skirmishes since August 10,
This is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive issue in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
A new constitution has been being worked on since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed in April's shocking earthquake.
Lawmakers have voted on constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and officials say a new charter could be approved by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone developing from a wide area of low pressure about 300 miles (560 kilometers) off the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center announced Tuesday.
According to the Miami-based Bureau of Meteorology, a clear center of low pressure is also located halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. There is also a 60 percent chance it could develop into a tropical cyclone in the coming two days.
Google to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help the thousands of people who have fled war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of management, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud sharing her own experiences. She was just seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe escalates, many families in similar situations are in desperate need of help.
Donations will be made to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Agency.
After raising $5.5 million through google.com/refugeerelief, Google promises to donate the equivalent amount, bringing the total to $11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since World War II, particularly aggravated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive unresectable treatment.
"It takes time to get mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who covered the new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by various methods.
Surgical methods reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of studies have involved morbidly overweight individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
Body mass index indicates weight and height, where the normal value is between 18.5 and 24.9.
When the BMI is over 25, the person is overweight, and a BMI above 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own BMI at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan utilized data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and sleeve surgery, with drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the average BMI dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Body mass index in the non-operative treatment group was maintained around 29.
For those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36 percent and partially cured at 28 percent.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely cured in only 1 percent and partially cured in only about 2 percent.
The study also found blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgically treated group.
The researchers also monitored patients' hemoglobin A1c levels, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
Researchers say the recommended level of hemoglobin-A1c is less than 7 percent.
After surgery, hemoglobin-A1c levels dropped from an average of 9 percent to 6 percent.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at about 8 percent.
A hemoglobin-A1c count indicates control of blood sugar levels. However, a team led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The team also compared the consequences of two different surgery methods.
In the fifth year in the gastric bypass group, weight loss was greater compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), body mass index drop was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as were hemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent). In the bypass group, diabetes was also completely cured by a larger proportion (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively).
The new study failed to show a lower death rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone, who works at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgical treatment brings years of life for obese individuals.
In a Swedish study, obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery had a 29 percent reduction in the odds of death over 15 years compared to the group who received traditional treatment.
While the new study found no lower mortality, Blackstone said there was confirmation that individuals with a body mass index below 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the main finding of the study, which concludes that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone said people and doctors should take weight seriously when the BMI is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher concluded.
"When you've accumulated genetic changes in a person's body that predispose them to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to turn the situation around."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe will not be able to host all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, saying the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A leading figure in Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered his speech at the Oxford-based Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, which focuses on ethics research.
According to the Dalai Lama, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is unthinkable that everyone could come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in his speech.
While applauding the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis situation, the Dalai Lama stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Looking after thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"At the end of the day, we need to think about how we can reduce killings in these countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The problems have never been solved by force," he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama further commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that by resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States was creating an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After 9/11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that a solution would come through nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Cases of hand swallowing quadruple in children in four years
According to the Georgia Poison Control Center, poison control centers across the U.S. report a nearly fourfold increase in cases of ingestion of hand sanitizer, which is high in alcohol content, in children under 12 since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Control Center, cases of ingestion of hand sanitizer reported to poison control centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly out of the reach of children, and unfortunately, some children are being put in emergency rooms," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said children drink hand sanitizer intentionally, some to impress their friends and some prompted by social media.
YouTube videos feature teenagers drinking disinfectant for cheap hops.
Teens are reportedly mixing alcohol mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink even stronger.
Younger children may be tempted by the smell of hand sanitizer.
"The kid doesn't think the stuff is bad," Lopez said.
"A lot of attractive hand sanitizer products are freshly perfumed.
There are hand sanitizers with strawberry, grape and orange flavors to appeal to kids."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45-95%.
For young children, even a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content in Handsides is very high," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Control Center at the University Hospital of Kansas, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whisky shot within reach of children, but if hand sanitiser products are often left within reach of children, you can quickly get a large amount of alcohol out of them."
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four loaves of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult hops limit," said Dr. Chris Ritchey of Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta, who treated the girl.
Nhaijah soured and couldn't walk when she was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored the girl's condition overnight at a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after consuming alcohol," Ritchey said.
"It was a really scary situation," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said on CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectant wipes in addition to moving your hand sanitizer out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing an unreported toxic substance.
Health officials thought the product contained the deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is listed as an active ingredient in the product label.
According to a police report, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to kill the "nasty" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and denied bringing it into the classroom.
Police ruled that the botched scheme was irrelevant and urged disciplinary action by the school.

The Dutch miss the old Scottish fighting pair – de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Netherlands national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has been dented by no longer being allowed to watch the duels between Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, who works in team management at Ajax, said: "There will be no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland. Why?
Because Rangers are no longer in it.""
"It's not just the return of Rangers we're talking about here.
We're talking about the Old Firm here.
The Dutch miss the duels between the teams.
There is a huge tension in Old Firm games, and they are also of interest beyond the Scottish borders."

RONNY Deila admits Celtic are having a tough time but the Norwegian pilot insists there will be a change.
The club, who lost to Malmo, were relegated from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic have had difficult periods before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
“We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is so frustrating, and many are angered or saddened by it.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic supporters as it will strengthen the players considerably.
The team spirit is really important now."
Warburton cautious on January player transfers
Although it was only a few weeks ago that Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at player transfer targets for January, he is wary of the transfer rollout and says the desire to jeopardise team unity.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," the ex-Brentford coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the squad before the season starts, which has been successful in our line-up this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can do a team more harm than good."
Michu looking at retirement in Celtic's sights
Swansea striker Michu has been linked with Celtic in player transfer talk. Michu, meanwhile, has hinted at retirement at the end of his Swans contract.
The 29-year-old Michu has been pestered for years by an irascible ankle and failed to secure a move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA fightback over Neilson comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned. It is the third Collum's red card in eight months to be overturned.
But Neilson stands by his words. "I didn't question integrity. I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded after a man admitted lurching abusive song lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened at a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn area before Edinburgh's local game at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local game coming up, and the atmosphere was intense," the striker said. "I can guarantee you I won't be going back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice management team has faith in Dundee United’s coaching leadership – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United's management team can turn things around for the better. Extradition on the pitch can no longer be allowed.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy with Hamilton win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen were forced to hang on desperately against Hamilton for their seventh consecutive league win. With the win, Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neck at Celtic at the top of the league table. For that, you have Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half to thank.
"There's not a cup or league-winning team that hasn't won games like this," McInnes noted.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, rising in British Isles
The number of people out of work remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, at 164,000, while in the UK as a whole the number of people out of work increased by 10,000.
The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared with 5.5 per cent across the UK.
There are 12,000 fewer people in work in Scotland than three months earlier. The number of people in work now stands at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0% in the quarter. The average employment rate for the UK as a whole is 73.5%.
Commenting on the fresh figures, Scottish Affairs Secretary David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Labour market conditions in Scotland have improved over the past year: and unemployment has fallen.
Why am I watching an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for cancellation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will be sitting in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I received the invitation in January through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I said yes to the invitation.
As the day approaches, I am terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought this would allow me to tell the true story of the death sentence.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists get to watch executions in the U.S., and because there are more applications than seats, participants are chosen by a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced reporters' seats from 12 to five.
Those chosen will watch the execution with restraint.
I can't do it.
I sit next to one of Richard Glossip's closest friends. I have forged a personal relationship with the man, as we have spoken on the phone several times over the months, with one of my visits lasting two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison staff say I cannot be present in both a witness and journalist capacity, so I am not allowed to bring a notepad and pen to take notes.
I just have to try to memorize the details.
One Oklahoman journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising impartiality.
"The bottom line is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I disagreed with the reporter.
The journalist woman admitted that she could have worded her words more carefully, but still thinks my actions are wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to write, I wouldn't obey.
I have told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist on the scene who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will contribute to the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being an accessory after the fact.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe there was insufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
You can read the unbiased description in the stories of other journalists.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
Man lured from Canning River after watery police hunt
The officer from the Canning Vale area remained dry as he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perth man's escape attempt lurched into shallow, muddy water. A police officer a few feet away was able to lay the man back on dry land.
Canning Vale Police received a call about an unauthorised stay in Beckenham on Tuesday.
Upon arrival, police spotted the suspect, who sought to elude police by heading into the Canning River.
But the man didn't get far.
"A man standing in the water indicated he would not come out of the water and urged police to get him in the water," Senior Constable Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted to water his uniform, so he opted for a safer tactic – negotiation.
"At times, an escape attempt causes a person to resort to amusing means," Sgt. Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown off by police and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the stunt inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says trustees tried to spy, and he's threatening to stop competing
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria officials of attempting to spy on his stables last year. The man threatened to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims he has been personally attacked by the trustees and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and Lady Tatai's rejection of treatment recently given on race day was the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always sought to act for the good of competitive sport. Moody has found himself in a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample, and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue out about the spying allegations for a year and a half, and didn't want the accusations to seem like the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to raise the issue. I pondered this for a long time, but sometimes frustration erupts once and for all," Moody noted.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences. I now have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe in it, there's no point in me continuing to be a horse trainer.
I would have to consider my future as a licensed coach."
Moody previously dropped the bombshell in an interview with Racing.com about the integrity department's spying efforts on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my garage with the intention of spying on my actions. I will tell the man's name when asked," Moody stated to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they would do well to provide the evidence, as I have not been caught with anything unauthorised.
Former RVL chairman Robert Roulston, current RVL chairman David Moodie and current RVL chief executive Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal manhunt?
Should RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the industry on non-coaching staff?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Perhaps many people think so.
Maybe I'd still have a coaching licence and push me out of my duties, no doubt with what I've said I'll make a lot of people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make up their minds.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw.'
A long-running investigation into Lidar's cobalt values and a recent disqualification situation ultimately left the coach so frustrated that the man threatened to give up his licence.
Moody is best known as the trainer of unbeaten champion Black Caviar. The man described the race-day grooming rule as ridiculous after a clay wrap was placed on the horse's legs in violation of the rules.
“The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person on my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday in the day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on race day.'
Moody could face a three-month ban for an illegal clay treatment that organisers have begun to sort out.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody concluded.
Man who fled Cobram crash scene arrested
POLICE have arrested a man who collided with a cyclist at the weekend after fleeing the scene of a crash.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital. He suffered serious injuries after being struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the man driving the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to Shepparton police.
The man is likely to face charges of failing to perform stop and assist duties in a road accident and other traffic offences.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram remains hospitalized, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy makes mitten reference to opponents' wrestling talk
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy views criticism of his team's tackling game as a purpose-driven action by the NRL's two league favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson says umpires allowed the Storm to wrestle in an upset win over the Melbourne hosts in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to the Storm after the Broncos beat the Queensland Cowboys in the qualifying final on Saturday night. He called the game a model match and noted Queensland doesn't particularly care about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackling game and said they were just focused on the contact when they tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was boosted by the criticism of his team by the two top-ranked coaches. Bellamy sees this as an indication that coaches are worried about losing to the Storm.
"This issue always comes up. As I recall, Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year. The last six weeks we've just invested in contact play and tackles, which has turned us on the up.
Trent has been in his job for three years, it might have been a shock for him to lose because he has a great team who are not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what constitutes interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team's game on Saturday to our game on Friday and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, there was plenty of criticism of St George for his boring game. Wayne stated that the review doesn't faze him one bit.
Now he has a team capable of playing so-called football, especially his young, fast centre-backs.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have an arsenal of players like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his style. Not every team has centre-backs like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence from this when other coaches are so worried about facing my team that they resort to this sort of thing.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about facing us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters game than in the Broncos and Cowboys encounter.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen that, but what was the outcome? 16-20?
The outcome of our game was 20-0. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the breaks in play and low goals interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably come face to face with them.'
The Storm have the weekend off as the team will have either of the North Queensland Cowboys to visit the Cronulla Sharks this coming Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets go on sale on Tuesday morning.
Serbian free on $200,000 bail in drug case
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a 40kg batch of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a shipment of 100 kilos of cocaine on board the Solay ship, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
Police monitored a meeting between Maksimovic and an accomplice at the marina through the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse coffee shop. A 40-kilogram batch of drugs was found in a Toyota Echo car in the parking lot.
Although Maksimovic faces a possible life sentence for possessing the drug for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer said there was no evidence that his client had attempted to gain control of the entire lot but that the man may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
High Court judge Peter Flanagan said there was a risk Mr Maksimovic would try to flee the country.
"Maksimovic clearly has ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather jointly posted 200,000 bail, against which the man was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan concluded.
"However, that alone is not enough to prevent the man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maksimovic was let go on condition he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to police daily and stays home from 6pm until 6am.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to get paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to obtain images showing children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl slept and logged on to an online messaging service, where he got another user to send him inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, the girl noticed the phone was missing, and noticed it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to police. After searching the computers found at the address, police found disturbing Internet searches that have used search terms to retrieve inappropriate child images.
Mr Hogg claimed to police that he had tried to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and impersonated a police officer with the intention of intimidating paedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson, at the local court system Dundee Sheriff Court, said: "The man claimed he was addicted to intimidating people.
He admitted carrying out the searches on a computer, but claimed he had done so to impersonate police and so be able to intimidate paedophiles.
Mr Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Mr Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed it was his intention to mislead paedophiles.
She said she had been having disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Mr Robertson added: "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl was screaming for her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate images on the phone, and Hogg was then questioned.
The girl said the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to chat to girls who appeared to be significantly younger than herself.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road, Dundee, confessed to charges of possessing inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year. Hogg breached his release on bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be put on the sex offenders register as it can be considered that the offence did not include any significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October for background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted release on bail in this matter but was held on remand on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offenders register even before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes wrong speech in parliament
Mugabe, Africa's most senior head of state, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but video of what happened spread quickly on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by opposition party lawmakers that they have received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted with interjections the president's State of the State address in parliament. The president gave the same speech on Tuesday.
MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) whip Innocent Gonese noted seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to disrupt Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the headline of the message is "death,"" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that delegates outside parliament will no longer be covered by immunity.
The party whip says the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of a restructuring and savings effort in its business services business.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and differentiate the computer and printer business from faster-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
HP said in a statement that the company will record one-time charges of $2.7 billion for the arrangements beginning in the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP Chief Executive Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the demerger.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies transition to a new style of business." Whitman said.
“As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.”
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has annual revenues of more than $50 billion and the company is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to businesses, according to its mission statement.
Founded in the 1930s by Stanford University-raised Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the company now splits in two. The two started an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto that is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
There have been massive restructurings at HP as the transition from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices is underway.
The changes at HP, the world's second-largest computer maker and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in an industry where it is believed that consolidation will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team must back injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb encounter
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If all goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he should not be able to return to the field as early as December.
The best-case scenario means Wilshere will surely have to miss at least the next four England national team games. Knowing the man's history, his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The biggest annoyance of the latest problem is that Wilshere finished last season strongly after an ankle injury and looked to have returned to his former edge in the run-up to the new season.
"Such an injury does not threaten a career," Wenger stated.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
This is not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't to do with his ankles or previous injuries.'
Medically, that may be the case but, as Wenger also noted, there could be further injuries as the player attempts to return to the field mid-season.
There is also an uncomfortable regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different ailments since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of a total of 157 league games over the past five seasons.
Arsenal's wider picture is that, in six of the eight seasons since 2007-2008, the team has been one of the two teams to lose money most from injuries.
Wenger accepts there could be a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the injury record, which improved last season, will continue to develop for the better.
"Sometimes a return after injury can involve a vulnerable period where you have to strengthen your body and seek competitive assets," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body in balance. I believe in that, and with that his career will continue to be the one he deserves."
Arsenal begin their Champions League push on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing minor changes to the line-up.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are the likely starters.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to look after the balance of the team and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
While Arsenal are clear favourites to continue Group F, Maksimir Zagreb have some of the most formidable stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games for the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground trembled with an intensity of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season after being forced to bow out to Monaco. He is also still motivated by a distant hope of piloting the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal have not yet won this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also a realist with experience.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.”
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines through its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially when you consider that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics for young men are at their highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 65 in the UK, with suicide three times more common among men than women.
The Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of the Man. The campaign aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent survey of 2,000 high school students found that people with depressive symptoms have a better chance of healing if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The likelihood of people without symptoms becoming ill was also halved if there were people close to them who did not have mental health problems.
But the basis of it all is friendships.
Today's communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Quick response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Superficial success is associated with external values, money, image and social status. These all distract attention from internal values and our inherent yearning for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently found that money really can’t buy happiness.
Indeed, the great thing about Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the show's characters were defined by profession but by personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show humorously featured Joey and Chandler cuddling or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear the men could relate to this, though they don't refrain from feeling full-on.
One volunteer explained it to me this way: "Listening to people who are depressed and thinking about suicide, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men are supposed to do well is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of those shows that sets out long-term coping mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between the two men.
Through the telephone, I can offer help from the outside in times of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family.”
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the show's set has been brought to life. So if you're attending the event this weekend, you might want to take friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or do something even better. smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in a Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship might become.
Comedy Central to air the entire series of Friends – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the attack as Paris Saint-Germain began their work in the Champions League by beating Malmo at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of the debut game. He strengthened the French champions" position right out of the box. PSG, however, botched several goal posts before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani was painting when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
Also in Group A are Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only seeking an extended place in the playoffs, it also wants to improve its position for the quarterfinals in the three remaining games.
Although the SPG snatched the points, the match was not a perfect display for a team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal advantage and the man was substituted when facing his former home club, where the man began his formidable career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win and a good grip gives us a good foundation, even though we still have a lot of ground to cover," Blanc said.
“This is good.
We were hungry for a win and we were able to do that. It's unfortunate, though, that we couldn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after injury. The team had to settle for a 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series at the weekend. However, Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic with four minutes to go.
The Argentine berth, who moved from Manchester United to PSG last month, was named PSG's decider to take the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the appointment when he sped the ball past the Malmo defence from Marco Verratti's pass and then fired a precise shot into the back corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
But those expecting a crushing win over PSG were left disappointed.
Malmo defeated Celtic in the play-offs, marching nine internationals onto the pitch from the start. A team playing with five-man defence and two striker tactics was hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot narrowly missed the back post of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute of the game. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG succumbed to futile passing and poor finishing, not least by Ibrahimovic, who lost five goal posts in the first half alone. Right at the start of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick was deflected goalwards by Cavani.
But Ibrahimovic showed his claws on the serve. From Ibrahimovic's pass, Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland on 52 minutes.
The second goal came at the count thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan, playing his sixth of the season, fired an all-out shot when Ibrahimovic fed him from a left winger Maxwell's kick.
Malmo's sting ended in a second goal, with only Wiland's top counter David Luiz's close-range shot keeping the readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the substitutes' bench was disallowed just inside the final metres.
Malmo pilot Åge Hareide admitted afterwards that PSG were in a class of their own. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league where the level is not the same.
Qualifying is not enough.
Hats off to Parisians.
This was a top match from them.'
Glencore to raise $2.5bn through share issue
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, raised US$2.5bn in Wednesday's share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6bn to reduce debts.
The company's market value plunged 57 percent this year. The company is wrestling with a slump in the price of raw materials as China's economic downturn hampers demand and strains the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's share price painstakingly topped the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday for the start of the morning.
The stock rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore last week announced plans to raise $2.5bn through a share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30bn debt by a third.
The firm sold new shareholders at 125 pence, down 2.4 per cent from Tuesday's closing price.
The firm issued 1.3bn shares, worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group as a whole.
Concerns about a further downturn in the Chinese economy have caused the price of iron ore to plummet by half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by between 20 and 40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's Washington visit
A White House communique released Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States on a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25. It is a counter-visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between the heads of state, the US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to mark the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of mutual interest. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity for constructive discussions on topics on which there is disagreement," the White House communique states.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and he is expected to pop into Seattle to meet with several US tech leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip would go first to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a range of controversial topics, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activities in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated chat with Effie Brown, an African-American, and noted that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight that aired on Sunday night, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown as he explained the importance of considering different views of the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is considered in the casting of a movie, not in the casting of a program," Damon argued.
Brown gushed with dismay and hurt at the claim. "Wow, okay that," the woman noted after Damon's comment, which starred in "Alone on Mars."
Damon and Brown, along with fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, had gathered to discuss the race's finalists.
"Whoever is the director, I'd like to encourage you to think about how the character of Harmony is portrayed," Brown noted at first.
"The only dark-skinned character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People endorsed Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film. Damon responded harshly that the duo's choice could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the debate aired on television, social media exploded with Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in blunt terms: "The fact that Matt Damon is talking over the only dark-skinned person to explain what diversity is is so white-skinned it hurts."
The tweet was shared more than 5,000 times, and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the equal representation of the human races in the media is the number one talking point.
Following the death of teenager Michael Brown from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support nationwide. The movement seeks to end the discriminatory treatment of black people by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince alluded to the movement when he introduced the album of the year nominees at the Grammys.
"Albums still matter," he noted.
"Just like books and dark-skinned lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether that group should be characterized as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," the movement's leadership stated.
Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known if Damon has answered yes to the call.
American Ninja Warrior Series First Winner
Professional climber and crockery collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title Monday and signed off with $1 million for the win.
In the seventh season of the TV series, all the assigned tasks were cleared for the first time.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it through to the final round.
In the final task, the men had to pain up a 23-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to clear the task in the allotted time. He was the first competitor to successfully complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race. However, Caldiero completed the task three seconds faster and emerged the winner.
After a tight fight, Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after snapping up the $1 million pot.
"The payout is incredible, as I've never made more than $10,000 in a year," he stated in an interview with E! about his winning pot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what will come of this. The future is wide open."
Executive producer Kent Weed chatted to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten isn't being rewarded, despite being the first contestant to clear all the assignments.
"Under the rules, the fastest wins the prize money.
If more than one competitor clears all the missions, the fastest one wins," Weed explained.
"Of course, the money award is magnificent and will revolutionise life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he's going to dwell on it any further.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received plenty of praise from fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom family is important.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn’t win, he preferred to win for Isaac.
She also believes Isaac would have felt the same way about her if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers clinch victory over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers don't have particularly comfortable experiences in the second half of the season.
The Tigers, one of baseball's best teams, are now in last place in the American League Central.
But the team pulled it off Tuesday by beating the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins missed their chance to upstage the Houston Astros to fight for the second wild-card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, if only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind a rock in the second half of the season.
"Every win is comfortable, however you achieve it," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held his ground as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts of good play and allowed three runs.
He has only had three good starts in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the season strong this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for a switch-hitter to throw every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Tigers pitcher substitute Victor Martinez had three hits and struck out two runs, his first strikeouts since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he had four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He batted well," Ausmus noted.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept the momentum in the game."
In the latter turn of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance to get back in the game.
Center catcher Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-base hit near the left sideline on a layup.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a sacrifice hit, and Simon took over for second baseman Brian Dozier, who took three straight pitches before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass to Mauer. The rookie pitching substitute Miguel Sano hit a two-base hit. He was followed by right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on base, VerHagen got a 3 by Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The major league team led for the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit hit a certifying run in the first inning of the ninth, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon hit a two-run shot, and it was 5-0.
But the right-handed pitcher threw three straight pitches and was able to hold his team's position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed dugout that had just come off the injured list back on the fields. The man was sidelined for a month because of a back infection.
"Obviously, the start wasn't what I would have hoped for. As the game went on, though, I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to put in a decent performance and a few good pitches in the third inning," Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes allowed a one-hitter to second baseman Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
Right catcher J.D. Martinez's free pass brought Victor Martinez the game's first imported run.
Victor Martinez's 0-of-21 streak was snapped when the team had players on the bases.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos next had a one-base hit, one run scored, but Victor Martinez was burned trying to advance to third.
The Tigers increased their lead in the second inning. Catcher James McCann survived a hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, making it 3-0.
"Pretty hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit it particularly well, but the shot hit the appropriate spot."
The pitcher was Hughes, who pitched a scoreless third inning, then was replaced by right-handed substitute A.J. Achter.
Hughes was credited with three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight pitches.
Notable: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not in the lineup because of a batting shoulder tear.
The shoulder will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list because of a shoulder tear since mid-August, and was scheduled to enter Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris comes off the injured list and will be in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four games since being traded to left-handed hitter David Price on July 30.
He has been out of the lineup since Aug. 20 because of a torn oblique abdominal muscle.
The Tigers and Twins conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, run average: 4.43) will be matched up against Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, run average: 4.73).
Xi urges opening up economy to rest of world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth," President Xi Jinping said Tuesday at a meeting of the Economic Reform Steering Group on Tuesday.
"China should commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and develop a policy of economic opening," the president noted at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group set up to deepen comprehensive reform.
"By advancing the policy of opening up and deepening reforms, a new impetus and vitality for economic growth will be injected," Xi noted.
The executive approved guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting the inclusion of private capital in state-owned enterprises, and a review of the citizen registration system.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and undertakings in which investment is prohibited will be drawn up.
The system is being gradually tested and is being developed through test programmes.
According to the Communication, this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, the legal business environment and market opening.
The Government will also relax the supervision of companies, thus ensuring that companies have decision-making power over their own business.
According to the communiqué, China will allow the development of new models of cross-border cooperation in border regions, as well as the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
With the opening up of government-controlled sectors, many industries are opening up to private investment.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy. It will support the legitimate interests of companies that have received foreign funding and provide them with better services," the communique states.
In addition, applying for a permanent residence permit by optimizing requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also touched upon the rights of lawyers to practice and the support of judges and prosecutors.
Premier Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
