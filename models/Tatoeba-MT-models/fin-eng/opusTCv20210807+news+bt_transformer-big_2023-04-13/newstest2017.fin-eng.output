28-year-old chef found dead at mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't know of anyone who wanted to hurt him, noting: "His business was finally going well."
The body, found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was determined to be a homicide and that an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC network KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line cook at Sons & Daughters, a San Francisco restaurant, six months ago.
A representative for Sons & Daughters said they are "appalled and shocked" by her death.
"We have a small team that acts like a close-knit family, and he will be sorely missed," the rep said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this tricky time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "his business was finally going well."
"He found an apartment and was seeing this girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't know of anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a big heart.
His way of feeling a sense of belonging with the family was to make us food, to make us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," she said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip line at 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees to go on strike: Calls for new industrial action
Representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to approve new industrial action measures in their dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is asking the whole council to back further industrial action from the start of September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns over the deal.
Medical trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the contract, which had been agreed with the BMA.
Fifty-eight percent of members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members posted Thursday night via Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the board had remained "insistently silent" on the issues that she said led to the deal being rejected.
He said: "In this light, the JDC board has voted to completely reject the proposed new agreement and to require formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to give the go-ahead to a gradual and expanding programme of industrial action starting early in September.
The controversy has resulted in trainee doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete work stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The head of the BMA's medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawina, resigned after the vote to reject the terms negotiated into the deal, recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members in meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the contract was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the deal would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a consortium of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle over words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
Yes, we shook hands on the occasion.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he did not exude much warmth, even by his own low-key standards.
By contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not just to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offense was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be tricky, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of Russia's general public has also changed since Nov.
For months, the state-controlled media led a stunning, thorough assault on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed, the Turks were to blame for everything.
Among the most serious were accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting happened only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of agreeing a truce are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power in last month's failed coup.
Continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on charter flights that usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
That number is down nearly 90 percent.
As for Russia, I'm sure local tour operators and charter airlines will be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report phrased it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West over what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup.
Add to that long-simmering resentment over snail-paced EU membership talks, and Putin, eager to exploit the coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West, emerges.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is an obvious one for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a transition of power.
So this meeting in a flamboyant seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to introduce what one analyst described as an "outside consortium" to me: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
But the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself to the role of peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even addressed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can look for common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-blown disaster with NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it's surely better for the two leaders to be even on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland vanishes from customers outside Scotland
The bank's chief executive says the RBS brand will be reduced to a back-office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
Since nearly collapsing eight years ago and needing to be rescued, the bank has abandoned those ambitions.
The bank's strategists have been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands at this time.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been deemed right to let more national brands come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in place with Scottish customers but will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for the main office and stock market listings will be converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that are getting more exposure: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond as well as Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a round-up of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees because we will now become much more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under those brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not pursue Six Nations sponsorship, and it has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's now time for us to move in the direction of the brands bank because essentially (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of customers, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Prediction to reach 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after double win means he has 3,000 wins in total
Race rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone with his second win of the night on his home track while competing on the John Gosden-trained Prediction.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in race riding.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who won earlier on Ghayyar, said: "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here as well.
I'm very pleased this happened in Newmarket because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, this is not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humbled.
Dettori soaks up the cheers as he leashes out the Prediction after the win.
Two race riders have reached this milestone in barrier racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the current era and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have achieved before him.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical acumen sets him apart from others in the weighing room.
He is a wonderful ambassador for the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for many years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!
Seriously though, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the last 30 years, which is awesome to see.
He's a lively person, which is good for British competition, but beyond that he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with his trademark flighty descent from the saddle.
From flighty finishes to flighty landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a rollercoaster ride.
Heaps of wins in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and served a ban for drugs.
Three years ago he initially had a difficult time on his return after a six-month ban, but he showed significant strength of character in challenging the doubters and returning to his best form.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed special representative for environment and transport.
A Kremlin statement said that Mr. Putin has "ordered Mr. Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration," but this was not given a reason.
Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and was based at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol and government staff, it says on the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state, in terms of drafting laws as well as managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian TV station Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles persuasive?
This is a move that has baffled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet security service KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown by state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff pulled out at his own request.
But despite smiling for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially not now, just before the general election.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to run Russia's environmental policies has been received with real scepticism.
In comments to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me responsibility for four years for this very complex, one might even say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been chief of staff for four years and eight months.'
Ivanov accepted the position in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of Russia's Security Council and a former member of the state security service, the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the FSB, the state security service that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy leader.
When Putin came to power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after a second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
But that task went to another close ally of Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before his return to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson booted after punching producer
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation last month on the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The show's producers, ABC Studios as well as CBS Television Studios, announced his firing in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his termination was announced.
There were creative differences and strife on set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show about a team of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg situation comedy, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love 'Criminal Minds,' and have given it my all for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be involved until the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the cast, our incredible team, and most of all the best fans the show can have.
The Twelfth Season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in garden in Banff
A man in Banff has appealed for help to identify fish that have turned up in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish could be the sandeels left behind by the vortex of water.
Bain, who lives 500 feet from the ocean, posted film footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping someone could bring clarity to the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now stretches to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry overpass as well as a land bridge, meaning the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four brackets between the "deck fans," which are now being completed around each of the bridge's three columns.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 rake ropes.
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering effort in this project, which has used over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, completing the barrier between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where the extreme exact dimensions must match.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck for the last section of the deck will be cast today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck will be ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: "The first shutdown of any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this bracket represents the cutting edge of construction engineering.
Once the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the expanding north pole road deck, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, i.e. inland, side.
This was done by pulling the land bridge of the northern fairway 700 millimetres in the direction of the south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
The huge, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be pulled at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Demanding because the permitted measurement deviations by which the team worked were minuscule, just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after crews saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued forward on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got going," he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third man, aged in his 60s, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Mr Jones said: "These three men who got into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unhurt.
The boat's engine had a kill switch on it, but it had somehow dislodged from the person driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a venerable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have worried that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go gets people to get up off the couch and take part in some activity.
Screen time was originally limited to TV, then to video games and now, more recently, to smartphones.
So it's awesome to see that technology and outdoor activity aren't mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm referring to a fad called Pokémon Go. An app based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later, they gave rise to a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-on products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity had been somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the US, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS, and can be "photographed" (by phone screen capture) or "caught" upon discovery.
A generation who played the game when they were younger have joined the craze and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the US, the game has resulted in a substantial increase in the daily steps of the "average person."
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent in users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training level data.
Calls by many public health campaigns to "find 30," "get off the couch" and "be active every day" have yielded no result for the reason that most public health warnings are boring and are passed on by people who seem unhappy.
The importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Being active helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, frowning frolics will be looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
Yeah, so?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were earlier apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn't give a reason for movement in the same way this game did.
The novelty will disappear and use will subside in due course.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, in better shape and healthier.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's gymnastics multiple event
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity blitz.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic on the jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
Incredible on the perm.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast achieved the all-around title Thursday, leaving the gap between herself and the rest of the world exposed in the Olympic spotlight.
Her overall score, 62,198, was well above that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States balances herself during the women's scaffolding individual finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back all-around titles, and the fifth American champion overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
She burst into tears when her final score was announced, and her long journey towards this moment came to an end.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose blend of ambition and precision has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast I've seen."
The final test awaited in Brazil, a contest that was not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between her and the burden of outsized expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medals (in that order) in the women's scaffolding multiple scaffolding individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles achieved her first medal Tuesday when she served as the culmination of a departure party for the retiring national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi.
While Biles claimed that she has never thought about the future as she goes down her long road to the top, that is not entirely truthful.
Some of his perm program - the one that includes his trademark somersault - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to Rio's Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when the girl was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerhouse.
He hasn't lost in multiples since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina had a slight lead with two laps to go, it was just an illusion.
A balance boom and perm, where Biles is the reigning world champion, awaited.
He came out on top with a boom score of 15.433 and surpassed them by gaining 15.933 perms.
Raisman hugged him good-naturedly as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears rose to Biles's glitter-red, white-and-blue cropped eyes as the dream she once wrote about in her scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was something of a rematch from four years ago, when she was in a shared third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "Grandma," was clearly in charge.
He sent flying kisses to the audience after his perm performance in an emotional drubbing about a comeback that at times seemed questionable.
As for Biles, this 19-year-old's widespread tweeting earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killing shot while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case of the last decade were sitting in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot. That's what was reported in a police release on Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, as well as Ellis' daughter Maleah, were shot June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The statement says the gunman, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, discharged a handgun up to eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
Police said the triple slaying does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 the other adult victim had.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in the past four months in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of a home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS affiliate KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, as well as Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police bulletin about the shooting, which happened just half an hour before the triple slaying and targeted an empty pickup truck. This is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat, as well as bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting easier'
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike much of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all - of course I pledged," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was, 'I didn't know people were still doing it,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But he is slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She also loves to play with her two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows me how to sign "sing for me" with signs invented by Edmund.
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is no ordinary sign language - he tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of reasons: genetic, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional load of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a forecast in ages, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has hope-rich advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect stemming from Zika.
Things are getting easier.
You can believe the situation is getting easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana as well as the southern Mississippi overflowed their banks and posed a widespread flooding threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to counties that need it.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they are getting requests for high tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone was asking for tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood watch is in effect through Saturday for much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five inches of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were forecast to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said there is a threat of flooding in Ascension County, which lies lower along the river, as overflowing rivers slowly discharge into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, south of the Mississippi state line, was at an all-time high Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescuers are still picking people out of floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
The 62-year-old Hansford says the water at Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose quickly during the night.
She says another stepson, who lives nearby, warned her.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached up to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived at the site.
Hansford said that both she and her family members all have disabilities, and that she is the only one able to swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, military-style truck and took them to Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued were staying Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding "will quickly spread widely" as the heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says one witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been completely saturated by heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to Tangipahoa County residents being rescued from their homes as well as lessons being canceled in five school districts, officials said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes remained flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets stranded by high tides.
Shelters have been opened in the towns of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be allowed to return to their homes when the water starts to drop," he said.
In Hammond, a town in Tangipahoa County, two dozen streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrator.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Management Director Rupert Lacy said steady rain continued along the Gulf of Mexico coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but so far no flooding cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain still continues."
'Full of bullets' six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand and abdomen, among other injuries, but he was conscious when he was transferred to a hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several operations.
The family tells the station he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot to death in the front seat of the car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple shooters at the scene.
Shell casings like the assault weapon, which comes from a variety of assault weapons, filled the scene.
It looks like it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the pavement on the street.
"So it appears that there were a number of armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and reports say police are reviewing CCTV tapes.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the hand by a stray bullet Tuesday as she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the involvement of dark-skinned and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympian, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to consecutively win individual gold in the women's all-around.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the pinnacle of the sport, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie all went down the same path that Aly and Madison did when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the final five) because there will only be four gymnasts on the gymnastics team at the next Olympics, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, train in private gymnastics clubs run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families) and the list goes on.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
At these clubs, gymnasts get all their coaching, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics coaching to communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspire many young girls.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (primarily Black and Latino) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this remarkable Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop strength, flexibility and coordination in the body, as well as diligence, discipline and determination in the mind.
This combination provides lifetime benefits for good health, as well as school and job success.
This team inspiration will get thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and that's awesome.
Participating in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical trainees staging new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association union staff, but it was rejected by 58 per cent of the 37,000 trainee doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Mr Hunt unveiled plans to force a deal, saying the NHS was on "uncharted ground," and that any further delays will hurt staff and patients.
The first trainee doctors will be moved to a new contract that includes changes to night-time and weekend working practices to improve care during the tricky hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's medical trainees committee, said last night in a statement: "Doctor practitioners still have serious concerns in relation to the proposed deal, most notably that it will accelerate the existing workforce crisis, and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
The BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to take part and, at times, deep silence.
That is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the sanction and heed the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not, trainee doctors are prepared to pursue industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were postponed as nurses and consultant doctors were recruited to act as stand-ins for doctors on picket duty.
Ministers had hoped to end the row over the changes by agreeing to an improved contract with British Medical Association union staffers.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for those under contract with 54,000 trainee doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Employers" Association appealed to medical trainees not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Labour action achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, as well as causing worry, distress and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months we have spoken to the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of surveillance (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbatical, education expenses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health are about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Drug costing £2 a day may reduce risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to benefit from the £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to people for longer.
The anti-coagulant drug, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to lower the risk of a stroke or second attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to help still lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to help still lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people have a heart attack every year in England, with a quarter of these having a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fatty material in the artery wall that forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can travel with the blood and cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, made by UK firm AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers that risk by making clotting less likely.
Today's draft NICE guidance recommends that people should be given 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg taken with aspirin twice a day for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective treatments that prevent progression, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack subsequently have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to increase the available treatment options for several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Because of the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, for periods longer than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
Culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from his post last year for corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles chides police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud due to "race and religion oversensitivity."
The former communities secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said voter intimidation on religious grounds was so serious that police should be allowed to set up guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present identification when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a voting person's finger so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He is calling for greater press access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or a taskforce.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, it would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The report was commissioned by the Government in the wake of the Tower Hamlets, east London, voting scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous charges of corruption and illegal activities.
The tribunal found Rahman "cynically misrepresented" the religious feelings of his Muslim community, as well as silencing his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "conducted his election campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of loyal Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting to appear as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He raised a particular concern about voter fraud by mail, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made a number of recommendations for cleaning up the voting system, including providing proof of identity with ID
He says in his report: "Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of elders, particularly in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"Concerns were raised that...state institutions had ignored such behaviour due to 'politically correct' racial and religious oversensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system. These included banning political activists from dealing with ballot papers that came in the mail to stop "vote-gathering."
The report, which is being reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for harsher checks on registrations to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at options for proving voter identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the person voting so that no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail-in voting.
Prevent political activists from handling the finished mail-in ballots and envelopes in which the votes are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around polling stations.
Change the law so that it's easier to accuse people of intimidation based on the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography at polling stations illegal.
Require only English to be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff stick to the rule that a voter should enter a booth on their own.
Sir Eric will slate the Greater London Police force, saying it was "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought following the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The electoral court stayed Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities," he said.
He was found guilty without suspicion on numerous grounds, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized ineffective "tick-the-box checks" at city councils' vote-registration agencies.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a generator of parliaments, but this troubling and secretive spread of election fraud, as well as the denial of facts by certain groups, threatens this good reputation."
Crazy about Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other celebrity-faced photos at Rio Olympics
This week fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone berserk over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive double.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about her own famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently appearing on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look distinctly Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: US men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Kate's doppelgänger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how one particular archer could be star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
US men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after photos surfaced of him looking eerily like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, becoming aware of the fervor on social media, the archer admitted that since he was a child, he's heard he looks like Leo.
"I personally don't see a great resemblance, except maybe in terms of the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 is sure to emerge this year, too: the startling resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the 'sporty version' of the Inception actor
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who both have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russia's silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova has more of the same with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blonde hair, while the U.S. team's Nathan Adrian resembles a "sporting version of Joseph Gordon Levitt," according to fans.
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Presenting a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the pair
One Twitter user recently expressed happiness on the site that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical as well."
And the US football star and Dexter actress does indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully broad smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator issues apology after saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay infuriated viewers of Wednesday's CBC live Olympic broadcast.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been due to apologise after one of its commentators said during the race a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "died like a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the relay final of the women's 4x200m freestyle.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentary team to bring in "colour," was heard saying: "That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower, than Canada's Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realise he was still live.'
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200m relay final as: "That little 14-year-old from China bogeyed, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was thick and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how uncaring Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusting."
Shortly afterwards Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologised live for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We regret that a comment about the swimming performance went on air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that this happened.'
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to apologise on MacDonald's behalf.
The CBC then copied and pasted an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made, and that they were broadcast live.
We took swift action last night and apologised live to our viewers as well as followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments had to do with the swimmer's performance, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean for it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in this moment for a comment I made last night after the women's relay," she said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not him as a person."
"Needless to say, I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm truly sorry."
Primark customer stunned by woman who brazenly fitted underwear in middle of shop
Customers didn't know where to look as the woman stripped down in the middle of Primark's move to try on knickers.
Things weren't made any better by the fact that after assessing how he looked in the pants, the woman peeled them off and placed them back on the shelf.
He continued to gyrate and eventually fitted four pairs of knickers at a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman fitted knickers and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother-of-two who was in the store, said that after trying on the underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again and walked away from the store without buying anything."
He said: "People couldn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the shop floor, took the pair's featured knickers, took off her own tights and underwear and put on her matching legs.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded spot for a fitting. He just stood there shameless."
"Everyone stared as she took her knickers off again and clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, dressing up again and walking out.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would end up buying the knickers she was fitting."
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: "It's disgusting to think of someone taking home knickers that someone else has tried but not cleaned."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Mr Davidson added: "I understood that staff apparently tried to remove the items of clothing from sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be horrible to go home with new knickers and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven't been washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of an incident which took place at a shop in Folkestone on Tuesday 9 August.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
Here's how to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation grandmaster Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-toting robbers at close range.
Whether you’re approached from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay off an attacker in kind.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder, before striking the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the groin, and as the attacker goes from pain to kip, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the back of the gun, and back away, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab a gun and turn it over so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of his grasp, back off and point the gun at him.
Sounds tricky?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's grandmaster, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest spots for tour guide
A British traveller has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a presenter and travel writer from Suffolk, licked a euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet, as well as a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before each object licked, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment, which was turned into a film called On the Tracks of Inner Power, yielded surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem utterly distasteful, but in fact there are more bad germs in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright spoke constantly to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, nothing he licked left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became renowned as a tester of her gut's endurance as she travelled the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, stretching from public railings at railway stations to the flush button on the toilet seat, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film made, he said: "Since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth starting with dirt, worms and muddy water."
He certainly cemented his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a reading of more than 4,000 units in the photometer.
For comparison, the reading of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in one Russian public toilet, he refused to be licked when the photometer result showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveller's film, Following the Inner Force, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said: "This is pretty much the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting here.
The trail of inner strength was produced together with the Finnish dairy company Valio.
The firm offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, to help boost people's gut bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's director of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea 'let's call Ian'."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary will allow us, in an interesting way, to tell more about it to consumers.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the documentary's director, added: "Let's put it this way: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost respect for him."
Understandably, some of the licks were easier for Ian, while some were quite tricky.
I'm glad we were able to record some of those dirty licks.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to abdominal and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products with lactic acid bacteria added to them.
A family of bullies destroyed a rented house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted
A family of bullies caused £50,000 damage to their rented house after they were evicted for terrorising neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints.
After they were forcefully removed from the property, shocked housing company officers found the property to be in poor condition.
Gaping holes had been made in the walls, floorboards had been ripped out, waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been scrawled with graffiti.
The family have now moved elsewhere and are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, manager of Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property cannot be repaired.
He said: "This has been an actual nightmare for residents and I don't think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of points to consider here as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is disreputable, and their name is disreputable."
The couple had three sons who occasionally lived at the property, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Mr Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was cleared of anti-social behaviour in June.
Old waste was found in many rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have previously been passed, had been hauled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street, and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to move in voluntarily.
Relieved neighbours thanked the eviction, saying their lives had become a living hell.
One said: "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived as their neighbors for 20 years, and it's always been a bad situation.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone.'
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of neighbourhood enforcement at Cornwall Housing, said the family did not co-operate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property
Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the wild wall of the tenement.
He added: "It is a shame that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and that of his family, as eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very tricky case, as the behaviour was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the brave members of the community who gave us the information.
I hope this development brings some comfort to neighbours and sends a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived at the property at different times but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on one bedroom floor after eviction
Housing company workers must now clean up the stacks of waste surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, supplies, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possessing the Class B drug with intent to distribute.
He claimed the money was intended for the headstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partner are living homeless after now being left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Graffiti was scrawled on many of the walls of the house's rooms.
Police say they are seeking to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequence, as well as those who suffer from that kind of behaviour," he said.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour. Police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal horrified as military jet flies at beach-sweeping low
Sun-worshipping tourists in Portugal's Aveiro suffered the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept past really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and maintained that safety was not compromised
It was at this moment that terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows the military aircraft came within near-contact of sun worshippers on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers stood up as they began to understandably worry about the noise coming from the jet, though at first they could not see what was coming at them from behind the clouds.
The incident happened in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic fly-past on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice really low, and at one point it looked like it was about to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was about to crash on me."
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were horrified when the plane emerged from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training mission to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane needed to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had been flying significantly lower than usual because of poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one's safety was at risk.
Wildfires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal this summer, along with four deaths on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly due to low visibility conditions, smoke from wildfires as well as thick fog
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote's first-half profit better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better-than-planned profit of EUR 3.4 million in January-June.
Eksote recorded a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where it has been possible to dismantle institutional care by developing preventive services.
The treatment was carried out in all activities.
Eksote aims to reduce the number of procedures this year.
Exote covers the deficit created by the surplus in the past.
Any excess of that will perhaps be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote's board will consider the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borders Officers Sworn In At Immola
The 70 conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in as soldiers on Friday.
The military swearing-in of conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School took place in Immola on Friday.
The swearing-in of the tenth Special Borders Jaeger course took place at the garrison's sports ground.
Seventy conscripts took the military oath.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border guards.
250 of them were invited.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting at the time of the swearing-in included five veterans of the wartime Frontier Corps.
The average age of those involved is now 90.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
Somewhat ahead of the bandit - crime intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has operated an RTA (Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
The officer in charge is a lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in plainclothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers in Häme.
The latest reform of working practices
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that the police would less and less often go to the swamps until they received an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target daily policing where it is needed most.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, its three national units and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation leads the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments, and their role is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The inquiry extends beyond their own area
Where an individual officer is privy to what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the Police Department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
Using registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or crimes that resemble one another.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image is formed.
This can be done on the basis of either the method or the person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
Workers in the RTA unit don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't entirely public either.
Both their own methods and those used by criminals are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention efforts.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, the method of marking vacant homes used in residential burglaries.
In it, the makers put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the apartment's front door to test whether residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material is at least public to the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest ones order the district court's minutes, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
Assistant Commissioner Tero Seppänen of the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against a background of declining workforce and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended in 2013 at the end of the year.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
ISIS-linked schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumoured to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she was killed in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, the organisation's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, died just as she was planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a headstone and a testament to others that there are real risks involved in going to a war zone - that it could dissuade people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other east London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that the girl had married an Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after just a few months.
Reid says Clinton will keep Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is confident Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, should she be elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was nominated by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose a person to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a conference call that he predicts with "some degree of certainty" Clinton will pick Garland.
A representative for Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would nominate Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "hands" and "enablers."
He said Trump was unfit for office.
Treats says nude calendar is 'for women as well as men'
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nudes is different from old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them, too.
"We need to start introducing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can submit photos via the Web or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill the comments section with irate insults written by the screen name NotAllLonelyMiddle-AgedMen, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-touted re-emergence of records is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited by the novelty of physical objects, but by the yearning of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl record are most likely to be aged between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely to buy records.
The issue isn't just hobbyists collecting either, it includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their emotions in (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I stroll through the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit. I'd beckon busily before stopping, forming a cup out of my hands and saying something authoritative, like: "Let's investigate further."
Let's take a closer look.
Meanwhile, as the charm and grime of Soho is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, and office supply stores now fill the buildings that used to house independent shops - a handful of fabulous specialist record shops still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while as I stand very close to various men in some of these shops in an attempt to assess by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and strolls around the shops to spend a few hours.
I ask if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, shown in the photo above (he emailed me a sample, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn't afford at the time they were originally released, and he can buy again the ones he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice.'
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes many of the clients she encounters fit the profile of YouGov.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that records have become fashionable again and for whom it has become necessary to buy back their old records.
From the discussions I have had, people have generally got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl wokes of a certain age.
But what about the purported emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
Wez said some older customers have been particularly hurt by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the staying power of familiar record covers; items that evoke memories of teenage happy days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling the gap or some kind of comfort that owning objects creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I think it's true for a lot of people.
It's an easy way to fill in the thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker said abruptly from the stack of records.
An April poll carried out by ICM revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don't have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I'd probably look seriously concerned as I scroll through the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "reward" aspect of the revival is something Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large proportion, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people coming in who say, 'I don't have a turntable.'
So it's not the older people, it's the younger people, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
In Fopp, where there is now almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their seventies, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the aforementioned movements - the speakers rave about Wild Beast's freshest synth- and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisational jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is tricky to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes looking at the various records on sale.
He's out window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so record collecting isn't really an option.
'It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on your computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm researching denim shorts, I observe a group of teenage girls huddle around Polaroid cameras for a moment, before father and daughter ponder Crosley's record player purchase.
To the left is a staircase with a wall covered in records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorations, and some are so high it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely about "art vinyls."
But given that even the small amount of attention these items get can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers into the bowels of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about here.
It will come as no surprise that the segment of the population more likely than others to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don't exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings lounging around Berwick Street record shops flipping through records and avoiding the ghoulish, 30-year-old faux television presenter's gaze as he peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the holkeri has a longer lifespan than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who has studied sharks, says the record is held by a female believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five metres long.
French Court Rejects Application to Unload Stores From Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to demolish scores of makeshift shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, officials in Calais argued that the state should be able to offload a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The Calais prefect's office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying the free meals provided by the state-backed organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the camp's increasing number of people.
They reasoned that makeshift stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals to those who need them.
The tribunal in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were entirely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people living in "extremely precarious conditions."
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites under threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, a nonprofit that provides 200 meals daily, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has reached 9,000 people - a peak - after arrivals rose sharply over the summer.
Food prices in Finland are falling faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the chagrin of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
During the past three years, the price of food has fallen second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels.
Only Britain’s food prices have fallen faster than Finland’s.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, which was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
The leaflet compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are for June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We came close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now weighed down by food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stymied food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Intensified price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the price decline.
Major retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels as Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the control countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the EU average and price competition must continue," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made with the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn’t the same anymore.
Anyone returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change at the school over the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools and will be introduced in all primary schools at the start of term.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools follow.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan spells out the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in preparation for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of cursive writing will be abandoned, and instead schools will start practicing coding.
Swedish education begins at the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begins at the fourth grade.
But the biggest change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-living vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live for another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only overtaken by the Icelandic clam, with the oldest known specimen dated to the age of 507.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year, according to trackers, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females trapped in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Because previous studies have found that ice shark females do not reach sexual maturity until they are more than four metres tall, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann sacks nearly 300 - no reduction in sales
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in the troubled company ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It said there would be no reduction in the number of vendors in department stores to ensure customer service was not affected.
In addition, about 80 support function employees will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the reduction need was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction in population is aimed at cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million per year, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The profit improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter revenue and earnings.
Lindex operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
It will be rainiest in the north on Friday - with temperatures below 20C across the country
A centre of low pressure on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be showers in central parts of the country, but further south it will be pouty.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius across the country.
Rainy areas in the north will remain between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius.
Kenyan athletics team rocked by doping scandal has bizarre explanation for coach's stunt
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah posed as an athlete for the national team in a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to impersonate is 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials turned themselves in to Anzrah officials.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home as he "committed his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," Kip Keino, president of the Kenya Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
Olympic athletics begins Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right away at that time.
It is not yet known if there are any known consequences for the runner as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year en route to being the pre-race favourite to win Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team, meanwhile, claimed that Anzrah passed the athlete's accreditation card only to receive free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials for fear of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's athletics stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
Rio launched a battle for athletics medals on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty grandstand.
Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of tickets for the first day's morning races and 65 per cent of tickets for the evening races have been sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was crammed with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals have already sold out in Rio, too.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
In the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding, for example, thousands of empty benches have been visible.
When Brazil's medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo played Holland against Russia, only about 30 per cent of the 12,000 crowd were full.
The poor sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to soccer.
Although, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to draw the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organizers, said at the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, a markedly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, despite tickets costing almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about €9 to more than €1,000 for the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio's stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Established last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can redeem their rights to the land with the money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided virtually into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the bearer right for a fee.
The holder will have veto power over its 187-square-foot parcel, which effectively means not every holder will be required to get approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of possession is something concrete that can be passed down as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of possession for his company.
The holder of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of those who have acquired rights appear on the same map where the parcel data of the land can be found.
The only risk Leviäkangas sees in its nature conservation acquisition is that the foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of rights of way, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It is also targeting beyond Finland's borders and is planning a land acquisition in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku worst of major cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit of Finland’s major cities.
More bikes have been stolen there this year, in proportion to the population, than in the other nine largest cities.
Based on reported bike thefts, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti came top.
There were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 residents, according to police data.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 residents were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts compared to others," says Superintendent Tommi Reen of the National Police Board.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is in the top spot in comparison.
It is difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by how much people travel around the city on bikes and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sgt. Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will come out on top in the comparison.
The numbers of bike thefts go largely by what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a compact city centre, short distances and plenty of bikes for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
That’s 50-60 bikes a day, and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, although fewer than one in 10 cases reported to police survive.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where the police are alerted to the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases will also be discovered in connection with other investigations, when stolen bikes may be found in an apartment in a drug case, for example," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught on a weekly basis either by the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
He said bikes are being stolen from places such as shopping malls' bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, or virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that a lot of stolen bikes go overseas," Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns, according to police.
Some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm bells should be ringing if a bike in good condition is sold at a markedly underpriced price," says Reen.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Moose says. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk in that."
"Perhaps this doesn't so much attract thieves, there's not necessarily hipster value in this either," the Helsinki-based Hirvi ponders.
Siiri Valve, who had a quick visit to a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nudged against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"I'll think about it quite a bit, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," the Helsinki student says of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You hear from the guys all the time that bikes have been taken."
"Predominantly bad bikes, such boozy jockeys".
A bicycle was stolen from the house a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve expected to take it.
Under-15s to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to trial peer juries familiar from US
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the trial will apply to under-15s, who will now be deprived of criminal responsibility.
A peer jury intervenes in the first offence committed by a juvenile.
The idea is for a peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender himself can join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and the lessons learned.
The youth leader, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them steer the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury is modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after their first offence, will not be confronted by a panel of adults but will reflect on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio from service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences committed by under 15-year-olds may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to everyone in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had obtained a draft of it to see.
The newspaper said the open letter is aimed at Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
Signatories want party money diverted to congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the divisions caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking unpopularity, threaten to bring a landslide for Democrats in this election," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only diverting all potential funds immediately to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-embellished anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are getting smaller by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majorities in Congress" and that it's not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials who worked on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton laid out the details of her economic policies Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make sure the U.S. economy is doing well for everybody.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his cronies," Clinton said in her speech.
At the center of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a show of hands to American laborers who suffered after factories moved to low-cost labor countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, anyway, he sounded like Sanders in emphasizing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax exile, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president], I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post ahead of Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic agenda announced Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this one."
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut has been dubbed by Clinton in the past as a “Trump loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was herself the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making products in America himself," Clinton chimed in.
Such are Rio's ratings: The Games haven't glued Finns to screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports races appear as sharp mountaintops in television ratings.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: 615,000 viewers watched Tuesday night's swim from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
Of the Olympic sports most interested so far is Sunday night cycling and the scaffolding that opened the fifth day of racing, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic channel.
Head of Yle Sports Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings and reminds that for the first time in the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several different media.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the percentage of TV viewers who choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, too, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics will be the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you're broadcasting 24 hours a day, and you've got 20,000 to 500,000 viewers in all that time, then that's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race coverage comes at night in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone now thinks it's lame - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as well as other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
The initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games.
As of Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads now.
"We won't get the ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other minor technical issue with the use of the Rio Arena in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s canals and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most arduous ever for Yle, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Lake Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found an imprint of about 20 square metres in Ristiselkä, the depth of which was shown by a diving computer to be 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now, the official depth remains at 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been as closely studied as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average depth, it is the Great Lake of Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction, August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in average depth were misaligned.
Tax Cut: Tax on Pensioners Continues to Be Tighter
The tax burden on pensioners is still higher than on wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance was highlighted during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government's proposal does not include such a thing.
We definitely think it should be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the Western media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The issue heated up opposition figures in parliament, who grilled the then finance minister Alexander Stubb (Kok.) about the election promises.
Purchase power is secured, it doesn't grow
According to Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo, Ihalainen’s policy on tax cuts is mainly about securing rather than increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don't add to people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages sent by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo for their desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility..
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It will come in handy because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged Unemployment in the Middle East
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at the very least to halt its growth.
There were around 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thai attacks
The bombings in Thailand last night killed at least four people.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thailand's tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in order to obtain information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there was no word yet on who carried out the attacks.
The ambassador thinks the events may be linked to political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country for declaring their opposition to the law.
Thailand's southernmost provinces, meanwhile, are smouldering with an ethnic-national conflict linked to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He said the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police say the attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "localized sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to Thai police, according to the Associated Press.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in tourist hotspots Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on the resort island of Phuket, according to the Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, wounding one person, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin yesterday and today, according to local officials.
Both twin bombings killed at least one.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb went off in the village of Surat Thani and in the city of Trang each.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is the route to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of Thailand's ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not stir people to panic further," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, who is in charge of security, said at least the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
Speaking to Thai BSB, he said the perpetrators have been intent on destroying tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist resorts.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
There has been some time to get a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they may have found yet another bomb.
The bomb in Surat Thani was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN says two bombs were also used in the attack in Surat Thani, which went off about half an hour apart.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quadruple sculls
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with a 58.665-point performance.
Biles, 18, is still going for rack championships at the Rio Games on perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will for the past few years.
He won eight individual world championships.
He has won three consecutive doubles and doubles titles last year and last year.
On the U.S. team, Biles has won two team competition world championships.
Dimer World Cup medals Biles has from jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The impact will have no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is unconcerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think anything more will come of it,” says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen up close many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then bird flu and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't deterred tourists either, I doubt this one will.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters away from the blast site.
The hoofer heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says both the boardwalk and the main Bangla Road were completely closed early this morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came into the workplace this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put up for the Queen's birthday," says Huovila, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the mood was calm and shops on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
By half past three in the daytime on Patong, traffic had normalised and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who visited the impact site, says.
Later, the car was seen on Jouxholmintie in Kruunupyy.
By the time the police got there, the car had been set alight.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby spruce-up.
Another man was immediately taken into custody.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to a motor vehicle.
Police thank those who provided the tips.
Research director on Russia's leadership changes: Clear relegation
Russia on Friday made its highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his administration chief, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is succeeded by 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's removal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him amassing too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way to wield power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has clashed with other executives or has messed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special duties in environmental and transport matters.
In a tape aired by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and suggested Persecution to replace him, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear positional drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not high on Russia’s agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s seat that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the town of Jarabulus so we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij military council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters seized control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, really the civilians were kidnapped by Isis fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health that document publicity cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but it is based on the law.
The Home Office previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening News.
The minister justified the decision with guidance from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the minister's calendar and not in accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Director says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic showdown begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time in the run-up to the title race.
He injured his hamstring early in the season and had to miss the Olympic trials in Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've trained well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and journalists turned fans.
The buzz surrounding Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican's star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he qualified in the first 200 meters with a time of 21.05.
Bolt, who was 17 at the time, was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres to smash the world record and rivals' confidence with a time of 9.69 despite the final celebration.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career, measured by the clock.
The Berlin-born world records of 9.58 in the 100 meters and 19.19 in the 200 still stand.
In Rio, Bolt has stated that he is aiming for a 200m world record and 19sec under, but no one but Bolt himself believes it will come about.
In the 100, Bolt's toughest challenger is Olympic 100 champion Justin Gatlin of Athens in 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup finals, Bolt defeated the American by just one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost a title race final, if only he has made the trip.
In Daegu in 2011, Bolt missed the 100th World Cup final because of a guileless start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
The last finish line of his career has Bolt set for next year's World Cup in London.
This is the Olympics that sets me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year, I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes charged with doping
According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample that shows signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample provided by Xinyi on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping allegations have also come to light in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female hurdler Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample that shows signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, meanwhile, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had impersonated an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan fast running coach John Anzrah.
The Daily Mail said he had used 800m runner Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
There's no stopping Phelps - historic gold came show-style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States swam in the 200-meter mixed doubles for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same discipline at a fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1:54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed heats ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a bit of fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Gazette.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is among the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next up is commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little buzz on social media or in the British press about her revealing and extraordinary outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a shortish dress that is sure to have at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back-and-forths.
It's important to look good, and small fusses are just a fun thing to do.
I'm sure Skelton will want to be startled and maybe startled, but he stresses he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on the athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the uproar reaching as far as Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big of a sacrifice they make is OK with me," Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from (the host's) dressing.
I'm a little amused if this kind of thing has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests over terror suspect
Rio police announced Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with security monitoring of the games.
Police made five other arrests in the same connection and questioned two people before their release.
All of the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested for terrorism are part of the same group whose members were already detained by police in July.
Those arrested are believed to have links to the Islamic State extremist group.
Those arrested had reportedly fueled the violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been circulated on the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
Eighty-five thousand police officers will be in charge of security for the Rio Games.
Police detonate suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their preliminaries of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty concourse on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police let the public in after a controlled detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police cordoned off the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public was allowed in after the package was detonated in a controlled manner by police.
The crowd did not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for some time because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police detonated the package and allowed the public into the hangar only after.
The bang woke the Spanish team that started the Games sleepily.
Spain, which started the Games with two defeats, beat Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two Games, Spain achieved silver.
Police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Summer Games in Rio.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious find was in the vicinity of a road cycling finish line last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their preliminaries of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame put on Petäjä-Siren - the Finn reflected on the protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a tough time on Thursday.
The Argentine dame bucked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio in the opening start of women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a misdemeanor.
He was stranded by the crash, and the others ran away, Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
For a long time, the athlete considered protesting.
It was then not worth doing because it would have been pointless under Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund," Ms Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left 27th when he left with the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medallist is eighth.
As for the tip, the crash made little difference.
It's an important day on Friday, when you've got races going from 10 to 12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 things science says will make you live longer
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life becomes longer.
Other times, things that a person has no control over themselves can bring them extra years.
These include a propensity for middle-body obesity or social status.
Shopping regularly can prolong your life.
You don't always have to spend money - just picking up a carton of milk is enough.
Many studies have been conducted to uncover the secret of long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research findings.
Science suggests that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death," especially when it comes to neurological or heart-related diseases.
On the other hand, studies suggest that moderate consumption - between one and three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to more than six years, one study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughter can affect a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year-long project observed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for your health, according to many studies.
On top of that, it can also extend your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in their life, they also need to have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise brings extra years, there's no denying that.
However, achieving long life does not require absolute grace.
One study from Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who medaled at the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, he's more likely to live beyond the usual plump.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
Some researchers suspect that long life is due to a person’s social status – which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour among over-65s found that the person who shopped every day was likely to live longer than the person who shopped less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can cause premature death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
Drunk driver hit by truck
A serious head-on collision between a lorry and a passenger car took place in Koski, Southwest Finland, on Friday evening.
The accident happened in Koski, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie at 9pm on Friday.
The lorry had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the oncoming passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the lorry.
The lorry remained upright in its lane after the collision but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into a ditch and then over a ditch onto its roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was pinned down in her car.
Emergency services removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female breathalyzer test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Mail sent loose candy to wrong city
The Salo K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy was incomplete because the post office had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by mistake.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught her eye.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll have more when the Post Office gets the load!
So if not a traffic jam in mowing the lawn, the sign read.
The store's foxy signage is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this issue has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favourites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few laurels were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for Posti’s Business Transport Services, expressed his regret for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed in the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to make a partial delivery (to Salo) with three, but only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening News.
You didn’t get angry at the sign because you found all your favorites.
30 kilos lightened Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her transformation
The comedian-producer has slimmed down by dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of the life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos of her transformation on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her dieting career already in 2009.
He has a complete lifestyle change and has gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of her soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pairing has garnered several complimentary comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We are on the same journey, motivation is strong.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let’s do it now project.
I get a lot of energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, when I am on the same journey, another person tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds on the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos away.
During a three-month fitness course, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
Family of woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago is hoping that the victim will be remembered with a donation to police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has posted a Facebook update where it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations going to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nursing practice there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good Friend.
We still cannot fully comprehend that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go in full to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own yard in Koskenkylä, Finland.
The woman's neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was an animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and they had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court Convicts Posti of Violation of Equality Act
Posti had no right to withhold the pay of an employee who refused to introduce a temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimated in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the onboarding employee’s salary that corresponded to the onboarding’s share of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU’s organizational decision on the induction ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise temporary workers with the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalists’ Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in their letter, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin sacks head of his administration, replaces him with Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired presidential administration chief Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
In his place will be Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet-Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of Russia's Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close-knit inner circle, will take up special duties in environmental and transport matters, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested Persecution to replace him, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on KGB espionage.
Ivanov was considered by many to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not to be seen in Premier League opener
The world football transfer record-holder will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed along for England.
Manchester United boss Paul Pogba will be on the sidelines as ManU open their league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, he will be kept out of the game by the English FA as Pogba was left burdened with a ban from Juventus.
He received two cautions in last season's Italian Cup, and will serve a one-match ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, delusion of grandeur is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of cosiness have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival-goers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which takes place in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small event to tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's quite unusual in productions to think that way.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the authorities’ regulations,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors last year by 5,000.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered in huge pathways.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been expanded to include 130 performers, art installations, numerous restaurant outlets and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, a tent of 15,000 people will serve as a venue this year.
Rock admits that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the support of approximately EUR 20,000 from the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company that runs Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can be used to create "creepy things" such as the construction of a 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
But the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost in terms of content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer in a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we will see him at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done a heck of a lot of good gigs in the last few years.
Bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - as tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and detonated using cellphones.
The bombs were planted on a street most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, said police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If you can't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said a bomb had gone off by the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets," Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one was reportedly killed.
Meanwhile, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had yet to detonate.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to be carried out by insurgent forces who are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand's military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police had recently seized on the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go to battle first in war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered into combat duties until several months after taking the military oath, according to Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable, for example, conscripts serving for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the training manager, reserve personnel belonging to the standby force will be assigned first.
No conscript or reservist will be told to do a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it emerged that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola awarded huge compensation for mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the deal was made, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple were forced to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma was as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price cut from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District and Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld a district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma €150,000 in price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s legal and settlement costs totalling EUR 47,344.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly because the buyers had already been aware of some need to repair the dwelling when the housing transaction was made.
However, the apparent construction defects were substantially more serious than had been suggested, according to the Court of Appeal.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Mr Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had a feeling that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition inspection report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report cited ventilation as a risk and a lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater running down the rocky surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the notion that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be slightly controlled within a few years.
The deals were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which witnesses said was caused by both rock rainwaters and capillary-raised soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, the inspector estimated, microbially contaminated air could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mould or yeast exceeding the health risk limits was found in smear samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window bay, and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
There was also a dispute in court over whether the flat had been extended in breach of a building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although proper permits were not yet in place.
But mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could have assumed, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as is and that there was no need for extensive renovation work in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt there was no particular reason for a wider-than-usual inspection.
The purchasers have not failed in their duty of explanation, the Court of Appeal said in its judgment.
Creepy archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to bear children for Nazis - register also includes Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article in Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, Maryland, has microfilmed documents on a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
Andersson said the women were undergoing gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The race agency vetted women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and give the National Board of Breeds handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The race agency wanted assurances that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides by SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created the state-sponsored program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidized having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the 6th day, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko finished third in Finnjollie’s first start of the day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but he was the tail end of the group in his second start of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth in the overall standings after five starts, but a failure to finish second dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for positions 17 and three in the RS:X class day start.
Overall, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained in 23rd place at the day's opening start.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Fairytale Castle was recorded during a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From cruise ship bartender to tango king in 1995, best-selling solo artist in Finland and star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää can still bounce and he is currently on a rampage.
A book written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of her favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career took off when he won the crown of the Tango King at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go quite as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hungover!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from recording a song that has become a huge hit that it's been sung with a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the print was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfection and excellence from yourself all the time.
Another incident involving one of the man's most popular songs, recounted in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his then partner and the case also eventually ended up in the texts of You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, but it was written based on the news in 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari’s break-up with his ex-lover was caused by Jari’s excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and not true.
Jari called the label furiously and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and good for him.
In June, the British even surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of voters were in favor of secession and 48 percent would have remained in the Union, even though polls during polling week anticipated the opposite outcome.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
Former US President Bill Clinton’s campaign slogan “It’s the economy, stupid” flew into the dust during the Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics after all.
Economic Curly Tongue
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics draws responses from the profession to the Brexit debacle.
The most typical answer is not to listen to the economists, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation economists have for the loss of economic standing is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still believe that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the notion that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes export industries.
In the economist's view, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
They were particularly impressed by the BBC’s level playing field, which gave as much room to the two-percent-plus economists in favour of leaving the EU as it did to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic might about the consequences of separation are.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not, in their own opinion, have common interests.
Yes, big-city academics like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message didn't work.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congestes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in every coffee shop.
How many more jobs would Britons have if they walked away?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would a Brit get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the children of a real Brit get a school place if they got rid of them?
Every town has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they bailed?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses received no visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have even more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their spending generates jobs.
Aberdeen property fund braced for Brexit cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said people in Aberdeen were preparing in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Preparations for Plan B, the victory of the pro-EU camp, began to unfold a few weeks before the vote in case the result was to leave.
The worry was that investors would start to pull their funds out of the market.
Real estate funds normally don't have sizeable liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We set out to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open-ended daily quoted property fund affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5bn.
In total, the company's funds are worth about £20bn.
It was the highest number of any of the nine open-ended property funds, Vanhanen says of all the open-ended property funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below ten per cent.
So property funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went berserk.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he judged that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the property funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together bungled the situation and put the issue in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
That put investors on edge.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and fund after fund was forced to close.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling out the money now in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't pay, as there would be losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them retracted the announcement.
Since then it has been fairly steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been nothing like the turmoil in Aberdeen's continental Europe funds, for example.
But there were a lot of queries.
Unreasonable attention to property funds
Vanhanen felt that the closings of real estate fund transactions received an inordinate amount of attention.
Open-ended funds, which were affected by the closures, control about 4 per cent of UK property.
Aberdeen's lockdown lasted six days, with the company selling off fewer than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may keep its funds closed into 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, with growth forecasts for the economy raved down, but the situation does not look "more dire" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, in addition to a 15 per cent sell-off in the market ahead of the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 per cent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit has hit London’s property market
By 2 a.m., the situation still didn't look like much.
But at 4am, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of property investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British property fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this now goes to plan B, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early hours of the morning.
TV screens normally set to silent at the office blared the news, and the usually loud crowd completely hushed to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, display terminals flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live," Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's biggest property funds, finalised two property deals the day after the Brexit vote, or midsummer.
The mood was mixed.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was calm in a way, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote sparks corrective move
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound plummeted, Britain's lead went to the exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp falls for the UK property market, and London in particular.
Minuses of up to 20 per cent were anticipated for London office space in the coming years.
Soon, a group of UK property funds began to freeze their trading one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty still hangs in the air.
Not that it shows on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is still far too early to say much about what will come of Brexit.
So much remains open: how the separation will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial data on developments in the London property market are already available.
Real estate services company CBRE's data on price trends cover about a third of the market.
They show that prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that dire, but they are month-to-month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops coincided with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
It’s also interesting because Brexit was quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
He does not think this is an appropriate comparison, as it is now a domestic crisis.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now seen not panic selling like that period but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally available.
The repair business could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the move to fix prices is no wonder to him - one that could have been ahead even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other world number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have edged up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to globalize, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking abroad for real estate investments.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension providers, for example, to look for returns on new items.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, clearly less leverage has been used now than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price growth levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and turned out to be a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turnaround to be expected, and now it came.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
Not much he dares to estimate for the future, but says there is unlikely to be any upward spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, having been in real estate since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes you can get out of potholes with a job.
If you're well prepared for the risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralised, the risks have also been decentralised, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you eat, as the trading group said today that it will start collecting more detailed information on its regular customers’ purchases.
After collecting information on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in the beginning of May also for purchased products.
S Group follows Kesko in this regard, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have denied the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to their food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and there are no plans to do so at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own loyalty program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or category levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know which store the purchases were made in and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level that K-Group or S-Group have," says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
He said the loyalty program is to be overhauled in the future, but Local Store will tell us later.
Ora does not, however, promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase includes the date and time of purchase, location, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the details of the S-bonus partners are obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing information will be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terros and ABC chains, however, data are currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in escrow anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored information on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is the latest dog reinforcement from Customs - puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black Labrador puppy sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
The box Heila was sitting next to revealed a jar full of shell casings that smelled of gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila the dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialised in finding weapons and explosives and will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, the tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures to be taken at Customs, and after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, the inspector general of Customs.
Another main reason for training a dog with weapons and explosives is the postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million items of mail pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, among online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will be looking at checked baggage and mail items.
In the future, ports will benefit greatly by being able to go through large container areas and mark areas that require further investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Mr Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy’s training is coordinated by the Finnish Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training sessions with Heila’s police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include six drug dogs from Customs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and streams of people.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without him at home, he laughs.
Subtle orders go straight to Heila.
The Ilta-Sanomat cameraman loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns what appears to be a soft toy immediately on the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest,” Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year.
They have a working age of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work periods only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is strong competition to become a working dog owner at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to become Heila’s owner.
Luck fell on Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks at Customs.
Mini-State gets its first Olympic medal; nation gets day off
With a population of less than one million, Fiji's Olympic gold in rugby is valued so highly in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
The country's public broadcaster said Fiji's government confirmed the issue after the championship was decided.
The day off will be the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the final in the capital, Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola managed his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard-fought race.
For a lifter, Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening characteristic.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one could really say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from the push and 145 kilos from the rapture in Rio.
His total was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push on his last 175 pounds, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights lifted, accompanied by a ferocious roar.
The body was trembling under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the men's football league, has signed Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top-ranked player who has the power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Little by little, the group started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovanieme will meet reigning Finnish champion SJK.
There was a need for a new striker for RoPS when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Defiant Modern Family star shrugs off again: teen star's shorts reveal just about everything
Ariel Winter, known as the kind Alex Dunphy of Modern Family, once again flaunts her voluptuous figure.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and demeanour to considerably bolder.
The star has posed for photos on social media in very few clothes and has got numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also posted several photos of herself partying recently.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on TV almost her entire life and has grown up in the age of the Kardashians.
He's learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood," Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started Modern Family when she was just 11 years old.
The actor has outraged some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years when the lows are already that high, notes one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, by contrast, excuse the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look amazing!
I don't care what anyone says.
You are an inspiration to many women.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn, it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to entice Japanese people to start aurora borealis trips already in the early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations for Japanese aurora tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are an asset to our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with hearty winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter aurora trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese people would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and this is where the northern lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as many nights as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese spend 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fidi masterclass leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to the final challenge presented by Fiji in Thursday night's final as the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji staged a masterclass in handling, bites, dodges, support play, running lines and sheer power as they won gold - their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable consolation of a silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and made them proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby kick-off tournament, which saw them beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard-fought 7-5 win over South Africa in the semi-final earlier in the day may have troubled them in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have won in this condition even with a team of 15 in top condition.
Great Britain may - but probably won't - be comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the Fid head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a UK trip.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi made an excellent start, fending off Great Britain tackles for fun.
For captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running at moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in a corner into the end zone.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown down the right sideline led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring the third goal, but it was only a slow-motion one for Fid.
On seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again from the new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock...first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou surged through the loose tackles of Great Britain and scrambled to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the score going into the break was 29-0.
It looked just like Fidi was born to play rugby, while the UK was just learning the game.
And that's actually the way it is.
Great Britain made a raft of changes at the break, plugging Fid's dam...for a full four minutes, which compared to the first half was fine until Josua Tuisova scored after Fid's impressive passing play.
Dan Norton grabbed a goal for Great Britain while scoring a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost for the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters chanted, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was tricky not to admire Fid's jubilant approach.
Mata Viliame with his last-minute goal was the icing on the cake for Fidi, who needed no icing.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely smitten.
Earlier in the day, Fidi had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final in which they each scored one goal - Britain's goal-kicking decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa into the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed into the end zone with dazzling footwork and scored under the goal posts in the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside rugby team Anthony, secured the win and eventual silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer propelled Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There will be no gold more stirring than emotion at these Games, and that certainly means something.
From the first draw to the last, 220 rough yanks towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed by themselves, there were three voices on the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present throughout as the duo raced to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs competition - the first women in the history books of British sport to reach such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this turned out to be their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with swan's grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Underlying each rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually contribute to the things that matter. And no pair of hands were as integral as those of a coach who, after being diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, it was a close call.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it will spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky in that his treatments were able to start in early 2014 outside the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
That spurred me on.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward - 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, first in the pair's thoughts was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with her own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment on deployment in Afghanistan, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may perhaps be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin as well, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Rob have been great.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so I have to say a big thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
The pair set a rough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught up in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't trying to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good row and to win the race, and that's what we did.
The pair will wait a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend a wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was going to be my last race.
That would have put too much pressure on me.
After London it took me about six months to realise I was an Olympian.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," she said.
Iceland to change Panama leak-riddled government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were called for as early as the spring by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
At the time, his successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's outrage last spring will affect the fall election results.
In the presidential election in June, criticism of the establishment was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest remarks.
He said he had been sarcastic in claiming that incumbent President Barack Obama was a co-founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also complicit in its creation.
The Democrat party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander-in-chief of the military who can go down like that," Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of a burkini bathing suit, which is popular with Muslims, at beaches, according to the Guardian, a British newspaper, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone not wearing a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The ruling also says that swimwear that grandiosely expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's national day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest in his 80s.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae clouding has been observed at Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits given in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci levels in the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae cloudage observed at Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, resulting in a blue-green algae mass forming in rafts on the water surface.
The environmental action follows up with more frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae cloud turns into a blue-green algae bloom, this is also communicated separately on the bathing area notice board.
See the results of bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Treasury Department's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax for forest farm generational change.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The goal of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational change in forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Confederation of Finnish Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, there are criticisms of the proposed tax changes.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sale of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health starts from the premise that by deducting the pure capital income of forestry, it will prevent the loss of forestry capital income, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if no wood is sold.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest in the proposal is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been pulled too high.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest owner base, he says.
The Ministry considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of premises.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken into account in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing of the forest.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hailstorm surprises motorists on Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and collided
There was an unusual chase on the Himanga River on Friday morning.
The emergency services said two cars driving in a row swerved into a ditch, then the one behind collided with the one ahead.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the firefighter on duty, the ditching is suspected to have been caused by a heavy hailstorm.
Two people were in the car that was driving behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There are no further details on their injuries.
The driver of the car above was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres away.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
Findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumour increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to prevent cancer growth in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing not only on cancer cells, but also on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue.
The research results have been published on August 4 in Nature Communications, a respected journal in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing thrashing continues in court, prosecutor seeks murder conviction for another perpetrator as well
Muhos' family home killing thrashing continues at the court for both convicts.
Two young men were jailed in June for a family house killing in Muhos.
The other received 8 years 4 months for, among other things, manslaughter and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other's sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as an unwarranted young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man with the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is seeking a lesser sentence for a man convicted of murder as a young person and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were fully understood at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a counselor for the school's child welfare unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked the director from behind on a sofa in the living room, according to the sentencing arguments.
The director had got out of his grip and walked the youth to his room, at which point one of the youths hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with a cord, punched and kicked in the head.
According to the mental examination, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court heard the youths had been planning an escape from the family home since at least the previous day.
Ice shark is world's longest-living vertebrate, only breeding at 156
An ice shark has been confirmed as the world's longest living vertebrate, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, an ice shark, or ferret, that swims around Greenland can live up to 400 years.
The female doesn't breed until she's 156.
The lifespan of an ice shark is enhanced by the fact that it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of mussel is known to outlive ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive traces.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although a throw in one direction or the other could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump on economic wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would be unreceived if the corporate tax change pushed by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, particularly through tax breaks that benefit the very richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
A truly staggering sum of $1,000bn a year would be left uncollected.
The top income tax rate now stands at 39.6, after a reduction of 33 proposed by Trump.
Inheritance tax would be abandoned altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulating the business community and pushing small businesses into bankruptcy.
Urgently-decided environmental standards need to be reformed and energy regulation deregulated.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts rather than bureaucrats" to the administration.
"Destructive" trade policies are among the main causes of the US's problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
Imports from China and Mexico would be subject to a 45 percent and 35 percent punitive tax, respectively.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch at sea, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast to his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program as taking the U.S. into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her plan early Friday.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea rumbles fatally, but the real tidal wave hits amid the bustle of Madrid's streets - a reckoning with the past can begin.
That's the crux of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a satirical comedy that was slightly funny and lopsided, and its predecessor, Skin in which I Live (2011), was one of the best films of the Spanish artist’s career.
In terms of level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere between those two works.
It's a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama centred on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on track for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to implode.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) gets to be amazed right up to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recaps the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before her daughter was born, the moments she met her father-to-be (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, from the TV-familiar series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014), will take on the second female lead.
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered clunky, but I'd say it's time to swipe.
To the razzle-dazzle often so characteristic of Almodóvar films, right down to the humor, Julieta is a fair distance.
It's an evenly acted, restrained, place with good music in some places, and quite a sad film with elements of elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, so that it slowly starts to look more like a pure technicality than a functioning dramatic effect.
People in the film are affected by illness, death or otherwise just sudden loss, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true of costume: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same goes for the showy earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the respective scenes, do not improve particularly from here.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is outward and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Tales.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat evenly written literary film.
There would have been emotionally incomparably more robust drama, so big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the movie's theme deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Cast: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film opens at 12.8.
Government tries election gimmick - People's News
There will be no new cuts, say ministers, to prevent the True Finns from collapsing completely.
Cuts decided in the spring, however, are being made in a raft of ways.
There will be no new cuts.
The $4 billion in savings that has already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (college) assure us under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry’s proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
Education cuts will continue.
Municipal elections haunted
Why are ministers so keen to highlight the very fact that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the election season, not the polls.
We have seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the governing party True Finns faces a rumbling defeat, even though the result of its previous election was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
The True Finns gained 752 new councillors four years ago, and for most of them the right-wing government will realize the price of influence next spring.
The lifeblood of a government of three roughly equal parties depends on the Finns Party’s cant to last.
Now it hasn't lasted, with more than half of those who voted for the party having had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of ferment in the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
The rhetoric about no new cuts will, first, obscure the fact that next year they will be made drastically and, second, try to soften the blow that awaits the True Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the objective of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal, EUR 5.9 billion of debt will be taken on next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up as early as the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government will not be able to follow its own programme: the indebtedness will not fold or even slow down.
The second is to stick with the program.
That means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring parliamentary elections what comes will be taken up.
These actions do not reduce debt.
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not decrease, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove this irrefutably:
Global growth forecasts have repeatedly proved over-optimistic, meaning there will be no traction from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has barely budged since the crash experienced in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the graphs presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be around six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the True Finns on what is responsible.
Poll: There are a lot of tasks to be left to local authorities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of children’s day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also passes the responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, community colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, specialised health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled are most clearly wanted for the county.
None of the responsibilities of local authorities are transferred to the state.
Underage drink-driver ran from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu was running away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie at around 1:30 on Friday night.
A police patrol tried to pull over a motorcycle that had been riding without lights, but the young man set out to run away from police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, then to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed police officer ran to catch the fugitive.
A breathalyzer test on the driver showed 0.75 per mille.
He also did not have a driver's license to ride a motorcycle.
Among other things, the incident is being investigated as a gross endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with rocks overturned in a ditch
A truck loaded with rocks overturned in a ditch at Polvijärvi on Kaavintie at 9.15pm on Thursday night.
The truck had veered off the road on a left curving bend and overturned on its side in a ditch.
Emergency services lifted the injured driver off the overturned truck through a door above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil spilled from the overturned truck onto the road and was sucked into the peat by the emergency services.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Gulf of Finland.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres tall, slim and of good posture, with white under-the-jaw hair.
Any sightings and clues to the missing person's movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre's hotline on 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see a photo gallery of the Parafest's devastation
The plume that toppled the tents at the Parafest festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to get back on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program will be organized as planned.
A surge is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thundercloud trap heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its pace toward the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surges is difficult to predict.
The rushing current hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafesti, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents overturned, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare firm Caci analysed the most toxic fine particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two-and-a-half years older than that of, say, a peer living in the countryside.
Skin-aging fine particulate matter is a very fine dust pollutant that originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illness, which nearly 9,500 Londoners die from every year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's research found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who commute by foot near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with a variety of masks, for example, but a more practical solution recommends regular skin cleansing.
Tractor brakes fail - shoves man standing in front
The man had been moving stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor spilled on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor did nudge the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor did not have time to spill further, as it collided with rocks in front of it.
Renewed vigour for the coming season
League-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Championship, will go into the series, which kicks off in October, on better footing than in recent memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common ground can be found with greater certainty than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni will start his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who has featured for Rwanda's national team, is a chipper at 205 centimetres.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian measures 198 centimetres.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball competitions since 2003.
Now the sixth Games are underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was building a floorball team.
I got interested and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen studied computer science at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport played at SM-level as floorball.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball with the university in the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
While playing, she coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
The women's championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series for 10 seasons, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 matches.
The most recent SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Joensuu-based floorball club Josba was bred by Perttu Puska and uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to play for Finland in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacking player in Helsinki, has played in six men’s national matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power play score of 9+4=13.
Tatu Väänänen, the 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team's regular equipment with 117 international appearances.
Seinäjoki Peliveljet’s veteran player Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in a Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup, was also named to the national team.
Petri Kettunen is the head coach of the national team.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish championships of the Beach Volley will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the top six pairs in the rankings are eligible for the final tournament.
Essi Hasu, who grew up in the YMCA of Elimäki and has been one of the top beach volleyball players in Finland for several years, will represent the local colour in the tournament.
Hasu, who now lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar crowd.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be in the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues very often either, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s passion for sports and gave him a good lunch for a great hobby.
I have very fond memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in YMCA E-girls of Elimäki.
The main thing in mind is a jersey that is too big, kneepads that roll at the ankles, as well as staggering ace shouts and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment that was fun to play in.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - a team-mate's father coached us and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, the beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball during his junior years.
The beach has been used for biting since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior Finnish Championships, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey we're still missing from the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Crashing stream toppled tents at disabled event in Joensuu, major accident was imminent
A rushing stream brought down three tents at the Parafest festival for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-call firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the makings of a major accident.
The paper says the continuation of the event hangs in the balance.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started working with his younger brother Valtteri Koli almost two years ago as a follower of their homestead.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a yardless barn, and at first the bank wasn't enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to join the project, and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Koli, which grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten young food producers in the Rural Future magazine competition.
He is currently vying for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's Web site until Aug. 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (since June 2012) and the first reading above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual mean inflation, as measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016), compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015).
The cost-of-living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015), the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, the price of the following consumer goods increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's 'anime' effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says the anime has served as an inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables its roughly 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that would fit a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are simple, facial-twisting tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app advertises a blackface, or "blackface," mask or favors bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat promoted a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface," or yellowface.
And they wonder if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's larger problem regarding diversity.
News and outrage spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "offensive and uncomfortable to say the least."
He added that "it's tricky to argue against a comparison between side-by-side outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just yellowface, but yellowface taken to extreme demeanour.
Snapchat isn't the only company crossing these cultural tripwires.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents may mean they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, "it's much trickier than before for these guys to be discreet."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his post to Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believes the racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male management and concluded his writ with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they're able to make decisions like this," Zhu, who is Chinese-American, said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they're not in positions to feel safe or to speak frankly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The firm does not release figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but according to a representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push ahead with internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he will keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say this is not OK."
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented Isis intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said authorities from U.S. Armed Forces war zone headquarters modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than was justified by events on the ground.
An interim report by the working group created by the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at the headquarters, who said their assessments of American efforts to defeat Isis were rigged by superiors.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is an armed forces war zone headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom executives typically provided a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground. They were more regularly positive, than analyses produced by other factors in the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"Centcom events are unacceptable - our fighters in war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking policymakers," Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California, said.
Centcom's management failures reach the very top of the organisation.
The ten-page report describes in detail the incessant problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it provides no clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials had ordered the reports to be tampered with, it describes analysts as feeling as if Centcom executives had put them under pressure to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, is still held by ISIS.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders at the headquarters of the U.S. armed forces war zone manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report, released Thursday, will be followed by more large-scale results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's inquiry.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican task force's final conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a futilely isolated process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement.
Schiff said this process "prolonged the release of intelligence outputs," worsened the mood among analysts and did not "allow enough room for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into a "preset or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general has opened an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But, he said, "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these essential national security topics."
The investigation has repercussions beyond just the question of whether U.S.-led bombing efforts in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations called into question how much President Obama can count on headquarters to deliver honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The Islamic State intelligence review reflects the controversy of more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration advocated for a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about what the consequences of the 2003 invasion would be.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency regarding Islamic State intelligence.
Officials said last year Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic state had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after many lawmakers viewed his testimony to the Senate as an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins for fourth straight time in women's field hockey setting up showdown with Britain
A day after scoring three goals in the team's 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had previously done the same.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But here's what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation at the Olympic tournament and they share first place in their group with Britain, which was still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who finishes first and second in their six-team group.
The first-place finisher avoids a strong Holland, the leader of the second group, for a little longer as the quarterfinals begin.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans have created a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they remained last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) joining the national team at age 16, when he became its youngest ever player.
He wasn't at the 2008 Olympics because he didn't make the final roster.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same work rate in London that we have now.
We've done an about-face.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half by scoring on a backhand from close range.
India had come into the game without a single win in the tournament but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 till late in the third set when Bam took over.
He carried the ball long down the left side of the court, then circled to the middle and yanked the ball into the paint, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
This shutout was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalie Jackie Briggs, who had allowed one goal in each of her first three victories.
He's in good spirits.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline peace amid Olympic frenzy
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
What happened in Rio de Janeiro feels constant and inevitable, a furious message of competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It's impossible to turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to a conversation from a fellow person next to you in a coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, an Olympic first-timer and future heartthrob with dimples, could well be one of those names everyone knows, showcased in prime time and supported by sponsorship deals as well as feel-good TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, will compete for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate all species equally.
Farther from the centre, partly in the shade, are the species not universally accepted by all: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number on my particular favourite, I'd like to draw attention to the trampoline's restrained charm.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, so little attention has been paid to its presence in the intervening 16 years that many I interviewed did not realise it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance all the way to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share the men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan are defending their London gold medals.
But there's a certain underdog charm to the trampoline, partly because to the uncivilized ear it sounds better suited to clown school than the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
There are opportunities for amusement in the sport, as noted by the jitters of the endless bounces of cartoons, but it also has the grace of gymnastics and swimming, two sports that it basically combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning springboard.
Championship aspirants hop on a giant trampoline up to nearly 30 feet, and must perform swirling sequences of motion (turns, folds and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be judged on implementation, difficulty and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries compete in Rio, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympics is straight ahead.
Those hoping for a medal must go further, faster, up and over in their quest for gold - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They're not just hunting for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised coverage, for another sneering boundary: a world or Olympic record.
This single-minded pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and it can bring even the viewer to tears.
But it's also the reason why even watching the Games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline provides a moment of rest from this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant soars into the new ascent, seeming weightless like an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
This, of course, lacks neither competition nor difficulty, but there's no frenzied rush toward the end during the program, no jumps into the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to a Zen state as we can get in the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon with the broadcast starting at 1pm (ET), with the men's also coming on Saturday at 1pm.
NBC will air the finals as part of its afternoon programming starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
Amid the Olympic heat, they offer a quiet, charming moment that most likely won't be noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by providing male athletes to stare at and objectify (as suggested by male gymnasts in the United States some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is simply waiting to sigh at his new fan base.
'Generation is demonstrating' in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia cracking?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable nations, a firm ally of the West whose economy is growing rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country as they spread into more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed scores of unarmed protesters.
Widespread videos recorded at the protests, believed to be from late last year or early this year, show young people being beaten with sticks by security officers while being forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The United Nations' chief human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always going to be tricky, and going forward it's going to be even trickier," said Rashid Abdi, who is the Horn of Africa project manager at the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is valued by the West.
America's military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely, and there is even a new train for commuters in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have consistently spoken of government repression, opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be about to change.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this is what will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from central Ethiopia, said.
The whole youth is demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are manifold and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of power in the ruling coalition.
After last year's much-criticised election, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition, and now hold all the seats in parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea. The fighting along this tense and contentious border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past few years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of surging beneath the surface, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly innocuous: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have proliferated and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through the proxies of the network that hide the location.
Many young Ethiopians said this was how they gathered for the protests.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and the Amhara, get along better.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, thrived in politics and business, taking advantage of the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on a path towards organizing under one umbrella," oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos think Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by those belonging to the Tigre people. The people cover about six percent of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
A third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors in making opponents innocuous.
"The current administration has no basic instinct like that," said Abdi, the conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked off as a relative unknown to fill Meles's boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services, which are dominated by the Tigre, distrust him.
Many fear this could lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was engulfed in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested elections that analysts said appeared to have been first scuttled by the government and then looted.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuting train, and notable advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the intensification of contempt for the Ethiopian government within the country.
And now it is beginning to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hate becomes increasingly prevalent on social media.
Analysts say the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights into neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based ISIS claims as 'sarcasm'
Donald J. Trump tried to quell the controversy that engulfed his latest campaign on Friday by insisting that he was not serious when he insisted on numerous occasions this week that Presidents Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The investigation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in the tricky position of having to explain remarks he doesn't necessarily mean.
After the innuendo at Wednesday night's campaign rally, Trump claimed the same with increasing fervor in Thursday's interviews, insisting that it was indeed his intention to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early Friday morning Twitter post, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was an about-face from the day before, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump tone down his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this to heart.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign on the economy amid falling poll results.
Trump and Clinton battled it out as they talked about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the subject.
Fleeing to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses in the past.
Late in July after he faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "of course I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to visit the limits of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a pattern where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clarifies' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has tracked both candidates' language.
But I also think he's sly about his statements and knows they're vague enough to be filtered through a number of different lenses.
Instead of toning down his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more galling in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump generally tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his detractors of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever-closer scrutiny over the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into the uncomfortable position of having to publicly back him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
That's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the news media on Twitter, who harp on his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to get a handle on him, saying "They're not succeeding!"
Some Democrats derided Trump's excuse as new evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Previously closed cafe returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that had no wireless network but provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the Bedford Avenue curbside became too expensive for it.
The shop, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
It was mourned by locals as the latest loss in a city being rehabilitated as middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is overwhelmed and Verb is a soap shop these days."
But if New York is about change, it's also about reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there's the same unsophisticated vibe.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verb will be led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who will be the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a client offered to fund her in a new location, she said she was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb uses the same purveyor of bagels and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to give it a go.
He brought new ingredients.
You'll find bacon-and-egg-and-cheese sandwiches on the menu, with items such as capers and browned onions on the overlays.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but makes fresh juices.
In the nine months since, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly attended Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a coffee shop.
He says that when Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and the culture," he said.
Now he's back for coffee, though that day he ordered a blended chai instead of his usual iced coffee, one of the new additions.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully beginning in 2003.
He used to go there for work and always made the same order.
"Every day at fifteen past seven, regularly like clockwork, I would go in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
A photo. Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still does his usual ordering, but sometimes, for variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he bears no grudges against the soap shop that took over the old premises.
in fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb, using cold-extracted coffee as an ingredient in the cafe.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint's traditional Polish residents have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to put it up at some point soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the adjacent building.
For many customers, it's enough to get their old favourites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said, he felt like coming home as he walked inside and ordered a coffee.
"I'd been longing to get a sniff of it," he said.
A Square Meal: Depression-era crippling food
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his Oval Office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods like foie gras pasty, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
That day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity with the people who are suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the American people about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Coe's most recent book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman recounted life from a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, to be released by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some kind of culinary solidarity of their own, they meet a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-and-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a portion with turkey, potato purée and veggies.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple saw fit to discuss recession-era eating.
"The morsels were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient to continue the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe grimaced.
"It must have felt lead-heavy in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, Americans" tables, especially in rural areas, were like an eat-as-much-as-you-can pickup table.
Groups of women made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways the nation coped with suddenly no longer being a land of plenty.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was a new, affordable diet: Mystery dishes like mulled cereal and boxes became the main dishes, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," cited Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide the less appealing ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been at the center of American meals, became a sparingly dosed luxury item.
Special compilations were tried with calorie and nutrient content being more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for a book of recipes, too, Ziegelman prepared a dish from the era, filling fried onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified: "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter will go with fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts like Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the nation's eating habits as never before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and meet the challenge of converting lumps like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic tidbits.
Particularly tasty are accounts of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's let me have a cake attitude.
Meanwhile, as he publicly extolled the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was awesomely out of it all.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As recounted in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper with no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only one of Washington's dreariest, but also the most wretchedly prepared food."
Many of the Depression-era eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy will be our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they achieved a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example how she was unable to throw food away.
"He was indeed afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give the humble recipes a showy name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All sank their spoons unwillingly into the sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe santas once and another.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife: 'a little chopped walnuts might help'.
Gilead to be reimbursed for lawyer costs in hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
A U.S. embattled judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the attorney costs it incurred in a hepatitis C patient dispute against drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in charges after they infringed two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvon. That acquittal followed when a U.S. judge found wrongdoing by Merck that included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment filed Thursday, U.S. Engagement Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to release from compensation it incurred in opposition to the suit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the lab work at the bottom of Gilead's drug active ingredient sofosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
US-backed forces have completely captured the northern city of Manbij, close to the Turkish border, after the last remaining IS fighters left the city, a representative of the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the town after the last group of fighters who hid in the town left it.
Troops had released more than 2,000 Sicilian hostages held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's allied force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have undertaken an investigation into it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% in federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former secretary of state announced she had received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book detailing her career at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the benchmark for economic transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and reneging on previous promises to release his tax returns.
Under the custom, U.S. presidential candidates release their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the IRS audit as a reason for refusing to release their tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter as he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, a special assistant to Trump, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal to do so raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business dealings as well as numerous other ties to countries such as Russia.
Clinton has seized on the problem, releasing an online video Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: release his tax returns," he told the audience.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants as saying the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is running an audit of the IRS, and that Trump is "not afraid" of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns through 2007.
Today, the Clintons, who live in Chappaqua, New York, had an actual federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike the majority of Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton's reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms as well as firecrackers boost Tanzania's elephant conservation
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual means to stop elephants from wandering into human settlements - they are tossing the animals with condoms filled with chilli powder.
The means has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea several years ago in conjunction with the US-based Nature Conservancy, has stepped up its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the non-violent four-step method to protect homes and crops without injuring animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the conservation of these animals.
"Since we developed the...tools, we have observed a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing a flashlight at the encroaching elephant and playing the horn.
If that doesn't deter the animal, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown in.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and a firecracker, and then the condom is twisted shut so that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts chilli powder dust into the air.
One smack is usually enough to send an elephant the other way.
As a last resort, there is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle into the air. Fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
The French, Jewish-based filmmaker unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list an Israeli area code. According to the employee, this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in the German publication FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of country codes offered by the hotel.
But the country was not mentioned among the states you can call directly from a hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option of calling Israel through its own call centre.
Looking for an explanation, the filmmaker broached the subject at the hotel's front desk.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there "shocked him."
The hotel's recipeonist said it was a "thoughtful decision by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more consternation in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli area code," the employee is quoted as saying, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the incident a "great injustice," the Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But what is even more shameful is that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This needs no explanation.
We are waiting for the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a response online with people calling it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave in" to the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"Shame on you," said another publication, pointing out that a hotel on the stunning Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "inattentional" as well as "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear order not to include Israel on the shortlist was never made," Kempinski's representative is quoted as saying by Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The trouble began when law enforcement tried to disperse a group of students, leading police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the rally to express their horror at the plans.
Under Sao Paolo state governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, just under 100 public schools would close, and 300,000 pupils would be resettled to save money.
Some of those taking part in the protest were seen writing anti-Interim President Michel Temer graffiti on the walls.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters went out in unison in support of President Dilma Rousseff, who was suspended from office as the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have in large numbers shown their interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are poised to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of Iran's two-way cooperation is the expansion of trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, totaling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
"The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan is expecting a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's foreign mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also, for the first time, among the 20 countries visited by the most tourists in Russia.
"It's probably safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
Meanwhile, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. In them, monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner surges to finish as Briton grabs cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory in the men's team sprint at Rio's cycling stadium last night as a trio of Great Britain teams defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was the anchor in a role that his fellow Scot Sir Chris Roy excelled at, the legend was proud of the youngster as he raced to the finish, snatching victory from the favourite New Zealand team.
Britain took a shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a modest sixth at March's world track championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a specialist broadcaster.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's finish also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man Britain's coaches clung to in view of the potential in the Scot that has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the title with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in time trials, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy shift was a big part of the transformation, and that included Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to stick to the pace.
Hoy followed from his position as a BBC expert, and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, said: "The comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was absolutely amazing.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen down the track after a poor start.
He later retracted his comments and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with the overwhelming victory.
Hindes said: "It felt like being in London with so many UK flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We've lost so many world titles, so to win the Olympics again is simply stunning.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven of the 10 overall cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the developments of the past five months, we will be facing a successful five days in the cycling stadium.
Based on the fitness Kenny has shown, it's not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
That would mean the total number of medals for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also born on March 23 (that seemingly holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would rise to six golds and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old, from Bolton, said: "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It's won together with the guys.
To win alone is, to be honest, lonely.'
Hindes said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given a knighthood."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the time trial in the four-person, four-kilometre team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for winning gold at London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) takes place today, the second day of competition, when Wiggins is sure to be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time trials when officials called him in for a length measurement.
In the corresponding women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie's Katie Archibald advanced in world-record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The Great Britain team has come to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole host of medals.
Having presented truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed ahead of the Rio Games.
The backdrop has been drama, not the least of which has been the resignation in April of the technical director, Shane Sutton, on sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the racing careers of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
Based on the first night's races at the cycling stadium, however, it looks like Great Britain's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect moment could hold true once again.
Future of Portland smelter in question over power contract cut
The future of Portland's Victorian aluminium smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is in doubt after the power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed one of the plant's owners is closing in on a distribution deal, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the Victorian administration's decision earlier this year that subsidies required to keep the plant operating would not be extended.
The subsidy for the 20-year fixed period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs could be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the plant's closure.
Beyond that, a snowball effect may be possible, with the smelter using about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of production at the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power station in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to terminate their contracts.
Most of the plant is owned by the Alcoan and Alumina group, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the continued operation of the Portland plant will mean that the smelter's physical electricity needs will continue," it said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called "protection agreements" that were supposed to come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will effectively run out in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to pay off in the 2017 financial year," the power company said.
All potential earnings impacts for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently constrained by the strong outlook for the wholesale electricity price futures market.
AGL said that in anticipation of "termination," it has already reduced the value of the contracts on its books by $187 million.
Alcoa said the decision to end the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the smelter operating or secure the smelter's electricity supply."
The US firm said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was due to come into force in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it pulled out of the deal.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of poor economic conditions in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants exit the market, it will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a reality star for the Kardashians, is on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of the sought-after September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was a model at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Watching this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover announcement was followed by an idiosyncratic (or perhaps just fit for the Kardashians' style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the troubled Rob and Caitlyn cases, and involving everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but which ended with a classic twist: they were actually planning a surprise party.
It's the cliché plotline of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's television series (Seacrest recites the lines "I guess you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a morning-drawn bunny juss), but Kris had to get her other girls to somehow profit from this publicity.
This is because we've certainly entered a new era of the Kardashians with a spot in September's Vogue.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made the cover of Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
Vogue's September issue is the highest-selling edition all year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee table book than a fashion magazine, and the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus were advertising content).
The unveiling of its cover star is so hotly anticipated that for the past two years pictures from the magazine have been leaked ahead of the official unveiling.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years, the cover has featured more "celebrities who act as models" than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honoured.
But if it happened that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of her generation, would hit the former category, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities aren't relatives of famous people or reality stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all of those things).
They are justifiably talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's standing in the fashion world will always be fraught.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
That sentiment surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But spinning in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
She's modeled for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you Estee Lauder foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own apps, found behind a paywall.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn away 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away from community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on its already at-the-limits operations.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those with no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services in the community, already stretched to the limit, are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are set to lose 30 per cent of their federal funding.
Queensland Community Legal Centres director James Farrell said the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report showed thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Mr Farrell said if the federal government's decision was not reversed, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with unmanageable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
THE federal government will slash funding by 30 per cent in June 2017, meaning thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders will be forced to navigate complex legal problems without help.
We are appealing to the Attorney-General as well as Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately reverse these funding cuts so people can get the help they need with their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise funding for legal aid to the level of the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after employee allegedly threatened with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief threatened an employee with a gun in February while they were driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing "it wasn't going to happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the suit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, it said in the suit.
"There is no need to fire weapons to cause harm," Bordini said in the suit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told an audience in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" - by which gun owners and gun enthusiasts are usually conceived - could take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and allowed to choose judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not advocate violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and causing emotional upset.
Hope Hicks, a Trump representative, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reports Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call seeking comment left at his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow is bringing recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, when we went to enormous lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, as well as eliminating youth unemployment around the airport.
Similar to before the 2012 Games in London, some will think the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be shamed before the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always hurdles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211bn of economic growth, as well as leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered an £11bn infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget: from T5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the world's two busiest runways.
Now the team is on standby to deliver a third runway, backed by £16bn of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 was a great success for Great Britain and I am convinced that Heathrow expansion is that too.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trading and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow Board and former commercial secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in a cat-and-mouse game about blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass a program that blocks ads are a "cat-and-mouse game," said one of the companies that makes such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-enabled pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update the program's filters to again block ads on the social network's pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website code would be changed around ads to make it trickier for ad blockers to detect which parts of a page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back and forth battle between the open source ad blocking community and its evaders has been ongoing since ad blocking was invented," and that it's possible Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, about 200 million use ad blockers, according to last year's research from Pagefair and Adobe. This is nearly four times the number who used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is on the hunt for ad blockers for pages on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
Computer ads still bring in enough revenue to make Facebook think this kind of action was worth the investment.
Also Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "ad preference" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook argued that Adblock's new filters were worrisome because they would also block some of the site's non-ad content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook representative said in an e-mail statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway apparently suicidal
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appeared to be a suicide.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the Canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed an "act of desperation" and lay down in the dark on the road, where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers connected to the incident have already been questioned but not all have yet been identified, said police, who are appealing for them and any witnesses who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a "logical" step in this kind of situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That will be left for the prosecution to resolve," Hofstetter said.
Two similar incidents in the past five years suggest drivers are not being held accountable.
In each case - both of which involved a person walking in the dark on a motorway - it was assessed that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the motorway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of manslaughter by negligence after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The tribunal found that the police officer, who was responding to a 911 call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was a "totally exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed the model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, could once have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and still could have been spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation reveals its day side to the sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The end result is that average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current ones.
The model produced a story of Venus's development that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once habitable, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned under ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche coach job
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his position as coach and vice president of hockey affairs for the Colorado Avalanche, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president of hockey affairs and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
For this to be achieved, the view of the coach and the vice president of hockey affairs must be fully aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and wish him the best of luck in the future.
Roy was named the recipient of the Jack Adams Award, given to the league's best coach, in his first season with the Avalanche from 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked off Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not trailed in the past two years.
The Avalanche's games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 ties, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing a Western Conference wild-card playoff spot.
Roy, a goalie elected to the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two each for the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and postpone strike
Industrial action by North Sea oil workers over pay will be postponed while all sides in the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services firm Wood Group have been staged sporadically on North Sea drilling platforms run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process aimed at resolving the current dispute," a joint statement read.
We will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
Unions say their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was in protest at possible pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
This year Wood Group cut fees for North Sea contractors by about 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10 per cent reduction in its onshore contractors for 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give the company the necessary headroom to weather the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has whittled thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as the company streamlines operations as a result of its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labour disputes in a generation.
He said the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for the many, and not just the few, in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
Investments of less than $1.4 billion in new projects are expected in the North Sea in 2016, while the average for the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation rate in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete listing of the rotational rates of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age and even its solar system history," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis in Pasadena, said in a press release
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are just now reaching adulthood.
They are running at their peak level now.
At their peak spin rate, these maturing stars spew large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they put the brakes on the stars.
As a star gets older, its rotational speed begins to slow.
Kepler measures each star's rotation rate by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of stellar rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers, with the bigger ones making pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation that encompass both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation and, so to speak, hang up their 'dance shoes'.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the spin rates of the Pleiades in three papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
